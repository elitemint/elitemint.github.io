In what way? Well, stick with me till the and you’re sure to meet very unusual kids.<br />From a kid with two hair colors to a boy that has more teeth than he can handle, here are the most unusual kids in the world.<br /><br />Number 10. Milliana Worthy<br />Milliana is a baby that looks like she just stepped out of a hair salon, with her beautiful bi-colored hair. But believe it or not, she was born that way.<br />Milliana’s curly locks are dark for the most part, except for the strikingly white tuft of hair on top of her head. And even more amazing, her mom also has the same bi-colored hair. In fact, this condition goes back two generations before Milliana was born.<br />In scientific terms this characteristic is called an achromotrichia or an absence of pigmentation in the hair. This anomaly is often accompanied by vitiligo, as is the case with Milliana.  However, the little girl pulls off her two colored skin just as much as her hair.<br /><br />Number 9. Tessa Evans<br />Tessa Evans was born with an extremely rare condition called arhinia. Children born with this condition have no sense of smell. In fact, they have no sinus cavities at all. At birth, Tessa had to be tube-fed due to a tracheostomy tube in her neck to help her breathe. She did eventually learn to breath on her own through her mouth, so she’s not really in deep danger, but her condition also left her with a disfigured face.<br />Her parents agreed to let her be the first patient to undergo a new procedure to help her. A 3-D printer built an implant which could be placed under the skin to give Tessa the appearance of a nose. Once she has stopped growing, a tattoo artist will be able to impress natural contours and nostrils into the skin which will give Tessa the appearance of a “normal” adult.<br />The initial surgery was a complete success. The implant has given her a small nasal bump which has raised the area between her eyes. The surgery will be repeated every two years until they are satisfied that her face is no longer growing and developing.<br />Tessa will eventually look like any other person, but her parents are concerned about the loss of natural instincts that come with a sense of smell, including the ability to detect rotting food, poison, and burning. In that case, Tessa would have to adapt and learn to rely more on her other senses.<br /><br />Number 8. Dzhambulat Khatokov<br />Six-year-old Dzhambulat is 4ft 7 inches tall but weighs a staggering 209 pounds. Since he was three, he has been touted as the biggest child in the world, officially recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records in 2003. Dzhambik is so big that there isn't room for much else in his life. He is hostage to the attention that his enormousness brings him. People feed him; people talk about how big he is. He takes great pleasure in throwing his weight down on to his only real piece of furniture, a steel-framed bed, grinning as it groans under his weight.<br />The sad thing is that his mom, instead of finding ways to make his son lose weight, seems to be enjoying all the attention that her son was getting, even trying to make money out of her condition. She was reported to be charging up to $100 to reporters who want to interview her and her son.<br />Nelya, his mom, said that he was born weighing only 6 pounds, 6 ounces but as he grew, ate 3-4 meals per day. She, however, denied that she deliberately overfed him. Something I personally find hard to believe, given the fact that her ultimate dream for her son is to become a sumo wrestler. <br /><br />Number 7. Didier Montalvo<br />Didier Montalvo had a mole that grew so big that by the age of six it covered his entire back like a turtle’s shell, earning him the nickname of Turtle Boy. The rare birthmark - congenital melanocytic nevus – affects around 1 in 20,000 newborn babies but a top surgeon described Didier Montalvo’s condition as the worst he’d ever seen.<br />Didier’s life was severely affected by the growth, covering more than half of his body circumference, both in the painful itchiness of his skin and how it affected his confidence. He and his family were shunned by villagers in his home in rural Colombia in South America and his mother Luz was even told it was her fault for looking at a solar eclipse while pregnant.<br />The family were too poor to shell out for surgery - but his life changed when his touching story was featured in a local newspaper and a flood of donations poured in.
