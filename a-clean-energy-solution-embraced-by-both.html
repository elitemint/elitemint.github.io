Because if I had, I would then have had to 'mention' that the amount of land taken up by wind and solar farms is just a tiny fraction of that. And I would have had to mention that sparsely populated areas often have bigger problems than densely populated ones, because grid infrastructure has to spread over a greater distance for less money.<br />   I also didn't &quot;forget to mention&quot; that South Australia is a desert state, because it isn't. Some of S.A. is desert, some is semi-arid, some gets plenty of rainfall.<br />   I also didn't &quot;forget to mention&quot; that not every country has the kind of sunshine and wind that South Australia does. If I had, then people would have told me I 'forgot to mention' that countries that don't have a lot of sunshine often don't have a lot of wind, and vice-versa. Or that the two largest CO2 producers, China and the USA, have plenty of sunshine and wind. Or that even countries that have neither can still import energy from other countries.<br />   I didn't 'forget to mention' that battery and lithium production creates CO2. So does power station and coal production. As more renewable energy is installed, the power needed to make these batteries will increasingly be clean, producing almost no CO2.<br />   I didn't &quot;forget to mention&quot; Scott Morrison's recent commitment to nett zero carbon by 2050. If I had mentioned it, then other posters would have told me I &quot;forgot to mention&quot; that there is no plan to go with it. And I would have been told that I &quot;forgot to mention&quot; that there is no change to the government's policy up to 2030.<br />   I didn't &quot;forget to mention&quot; that batteries can catch fire. If I had, someone would have told me I &quot;forgot to mention&quot; that oil wells also catch fire. So do coal mines. So do power stations and oil refineries. I can't write a list of everything that catches fire. One thing that has not caught fire is the Hornsdale battery. If it ever does, I'm sure they'll put the fire out and rebuild it, just as they do with oil wells.<br />   I didn't &quot;forget to mention&quot; the problems of renewable energy. For example, the fact that the grid is set up for power stations, not wind farms. If I had mentioned this, there would have been more posts telling me I &quot;forgot to mention&quot; that the grid is being redesigned to cope with this.<br />    I didn't &quot;forget to mention&quot; that the Business Council of Australia has also just reversed-course on renewable energy and called for a 50% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 , after saying a few years ago that a 45% reduction would be &quot;economy wrecking.&quot; Lots of people and institutions are changing their minds, and I don't have time to mention them all. I chose News International because it was the most significant.<br />  I didn't &quot;forget to mention&quot; the fact that birds get killed by wind farms and turbines catch fire. If I had mentioned this, there would have been more posts telling me I &quot;forgot to mention&quot; that birds also get killed by oil spills. <br />   And if you think there are things I &quot;forgot to mention&quot; in this list, I haven't &quot;forgotten to mention those either.&quot; I can't make this video description 6,000 words long any more than I can make the video 6 hours long. Sorry.
