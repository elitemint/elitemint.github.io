{% raw %}I'm entirely fine with the police sometimes making errors. In the roughly 1,000 reports I've made, I've made a couple of errors myself. In my experience the police are generally pretty good and don't make very many mistakes on my reports. I respect them for being honest about this one. I think the rider still got an NIP (notice of intended prosecution) so would at least have been worried about that for a while before the admin error came to light. It's not as good a behaviour change agent as getting 3 points, but it should still have an effect on him.<br /><br />=====================================================================<br />My camera: GoPro Hero 10 Black - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3zARTPk">https://amzn.to/3zARTPk</a><br />GoPro Hero 9 Black - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/39oZFBw">https://amzn.to/39oZFBw</a><br />The GoPro headstrap I mount the camera to: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2PyVrjI">https://amzn.to/2PyVrjI</a><br />A good quality MicroSD card that is fast enough for this 4K camera: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/31qhf3G">https://amzn.to/31qhf3G</a><br />Spare GoPro Hero 9/10 original batteries - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3CFbZtz">https://amzn.to/3CFbZtz</a><br /> (clone batteries are cheaper, but perhaps less reliable)<br />GoPro Hero 7 battery and charger: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3lQ4vgr">https://amzn.to/3lQ4vgr</a><br /><br />I also use:<br />An Insta360 Go 2 microcamera: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3e9Jz13">https://amzn.to/3e9Jz13</a><br />An Insta360 One R 360 degree camera: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3eaMshX">https://amzn.to/3eaMshX</a><br /><br /><br />If you'd like to support me by buying me a ko-fi, here's the link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/cyclingmikey">https://ko-fi.com/cyclingmikey</a><br />=====================================================================<br /><br /><br /><br />RO20MVW <br />RO20-MVW <br />RO20 MVW <br />202007310750{% endraw %}
