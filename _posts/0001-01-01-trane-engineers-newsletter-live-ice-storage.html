{% raw %}Trane Engineers Newsletter Live: Thermal storage, specifically ice storage, is not only an easy way to store energy but it is reemerging as a valuable energy and energy cost saving technology for building owners. This presentation provides a bit of theory and application, then demonstrates the design steps for a small ice storage system from layout to operation and control. After viewing this program, you will learn to: identify the components of an ice storage system and its application, identify an economic rationale for ice storage and hidden costs that may raise ROI, dispel common myths about ice storage, and avoid the most common stumbling blocks when designing for ice storage.
