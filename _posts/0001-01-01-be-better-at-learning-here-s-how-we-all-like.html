{% raw %}We all like to learn, but it isn‚Äôt easy. There has been a lot of research into what makes people better learners and how people learn differently from one another, but how can we make it work for us? In this Seeker+ series on Learning, the first episode will dive into the steps that the brain takes to learn something new and debunk the idea of people being visual or auditory learners. Tune in and keep an eye out for parts two and three of this series. <br /><br />¬ª Subscribe to Seeker+! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/SeekerPlusSubscribe">https://bit.ly/SeekerPlusSubscribe</a> (then hit the little üîî icon and select ‚Äúall.‚Äú) <br />¬ª Watch more! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SeekerPlusPlaylist">http://bit.ly/SeekerPlusPlaylist</a><br />¬ª Visit our shop at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://shop.seeker.com">http://shop.seeker.com</a><br /><br />Let's talk about the science of how we learn things. We're going to do some myth-busting around sensory learning. We'll also explore proven methods for learning new skills faster, or remembering information for longer periods of time. And ultimately, go into how we all could be structuring our time to be the most productive and efficient humans possible.<br /><br />On that note‚Äîwe‚Äôll get into toxic productivity too. That‚Äôs important. <br /><br />In short, learning is how we create a mental model of the world around us.<br /><br />For animals, learning occurs when a personal experience results in a behavioral change. So something happens to them and then they act differently as a result. Not all organisms do this. Some insects, for example, spend their lives following a set of developmental steps without ever reacting differently to the world around them. They may never change their behavior based on something they perceive. They have little need to learn. <br /><br />In a human example, if you were to touch a hot stove, you‚Äôd immediately pull your hand away without much thought. Pulling your hand away isn‚Äôt a learned behavior, it‚Äôs just a reaction. But if in the future, you avoided touching the stove in the first place, that would be learning. You‚Äôre changing your behavior based on a past experience.<br /><br />Learned behaviors are developed over time by organisms that need to react to a world that was unstable and unpredictable.<br /><br />#Learning #HowToStudy #ProductivityTechniques #Education #Seeker #SeekerPlus <br /><br />Read More:<br />The Myth of ‚ÄòLearning Styles‚Äô<br />‚ÄúA popular theory that some people learn better visually or aurally keeps getting debunked.‚Äù<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-myth-of-learning-styles/557687/">https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-myth-of-learning-styles/557687/</a><br /><br />Another Nail in the Coffin for Learning Styles?<br />‚ÄúThe concept and existence of learning styles has been fraught with controversy, and recent studies have thrown their existence into doubt. Yet, many students still hold to the conventional wisdom that learning styles are legitimate, and may adapt their outside of class study strategies to match these learning styles. Thus, this study aims to assess if undergraduate anatomy students are more likely to utilize study strategies that align with their hypothetical learning styles and, if so, does this alignment correlate with their outcome in an anatomy course‚Äù<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ase.1777">https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ase.1777</a><br /><br /><br />How Memory Functions - Lumen Learning<br />‚ÄúOur memory has three basic functions: encoding, storing, and retrieving information. Encoding is the act of getting information into our memory system through automatic or effortful processing. Storage is retention of the information, and retrieval is the act of getting information out of storage and into conscious awareness through recall, recognition, and relearning. There are various models that aim to explain how we utilize our memory. In this section, you‚Äôll learn about some of these models as well as the importance of recall, recognition, and relearning.‚Äù<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wmopen-psychology/chapter/how-memory-functions/">https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wmopen-psychology/chapter/how-memory-functions/</a><br />--<br />Seeker+ is your home for deep dives, fun facts, rabbit holes, and more.
