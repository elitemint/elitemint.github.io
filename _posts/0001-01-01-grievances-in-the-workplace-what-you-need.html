{% raw %}Exploring Grievances in the Workplace, and what you need to know as an employee or employer, is Ellie Hibberd - Partner and Head of HRExpress. To speak to a member of the employment team, or for more information, visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/30ydckj">https://bit.ly/30ydckj</a><br /><br />If an employee has a complaint, maybe about the way someone else has been behaving towards them in the workplace, perhaps they think they are being bullied, maybe they are unhappy with a bonus award or a pay rise they had been given. Whatever it is, if an employee goes to their employer with it, the employer needs to take the grievance seriously.<br /><br />In the video Ellie explores what you need to when dealing with a grievance in the workplace, and answers the questions that are frequently asked: How do I raise a complaint at work? Does a grievance have to be in writing? Do all complaints have to be taken seriously? Can a workplace grievance be dealt with informally? What is a formal grievance procedure? Does an investigation have to take place? Who should conduct a grievance investigation? Who should conduct a grievance hearing? Is there an appeal process?{% endraw %}
