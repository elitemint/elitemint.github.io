{% raw %}G'day everyone, FIRST UP WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU EVERYBODY FOR A GREAT YEAR OF SUPPORT FOR OUR VIDS!!!!!!<br />WOW, 2021 is just about over and what a crazy year it's been. We have had an absolute blast on the road and managed to tick off 2 BIG BUCKET LIST travel destinations this year:<br />1. Arnhem Land &amp; 2. The Gibb River Rd<br />To re-cap, we left the Great ocean road at the start of the year and raced to cross borders into SA before a Covid shutdown. Then we exploredðŸ‘‡<br />ðŸ‘‰The Yorke Peninsula<br />ðŸ‘‰The Eyre Peninsula<br />ðŸ‘‰The Flinders and Oodnadatta<br />ðŸ‘‰Coober Pedy &amp; The Red Centre<br />ðŸ‘‰Arnhem Land<br />ðŸ‘‰Darwin &amp; across to Broome via The Gibb River Rd<br /><br />We hope you all have a Great Xmas &amp; a Happy New Year!!! We will catch you after the Holidays in Mid January. <br /><br />Thanks so much - Justin, Bec, Jack, Billy &amp; Charli<br /><br />Info links: <br />Our digital Products here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/35UyDQg">https://bit.ly/35UyDQg</a><br />Our Merchandise here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3x4ELBG">https://bit.ly/3x4ELBG</a> <br />DISCOUNTS ON ALL THE GEAR WE USE : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/35Reyun">https://bit.ly/35Reyun</a><br /><br />It all started whenâ€¦<br />In December 2015 we packed up and hit the road for what we thought would be a 12 month Lap of Oz.
