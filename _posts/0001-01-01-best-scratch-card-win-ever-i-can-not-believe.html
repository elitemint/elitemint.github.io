{% raw %}My best scratch card win ever, I have never enjoyed one as much as this win. This hit me from out of the blue, as I was not expecting a win on a card like this. I did this video as there was a draw taking place for a previous Cashword scratch card winner that I was giving away as a prize and a lot of people had said that they wanted to see a vid featuring this card. So here it is, 6 Scrabble Cashword scratch cards, and a competition draw give away. I hope you enjoy it half as much as I did.<br /><br />Please don't spoil the video by posting the amount in the comments section as it will spoil it for others.<br /><br />If you enjoy the video, please leave a like. And it is 100% free to subscribe to my channel for more scratch card videos and competitions.{% endraw %}
