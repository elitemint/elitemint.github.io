After a short period settling in, he became Borussia Dortmund's leading goalscorer for the next three seasons and was also crowned top scorer in the Bundesliga for the first time while wearing the black and yellow jersey. A move to FC Bayern in 2014 heralded a change in his style of play, which was only beneficial to his development. He turned his weaknesses into strengths and in 2020/21, his haul of 41 goals even broke Gerd Müller's historic 40-goal record.
