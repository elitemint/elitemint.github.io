{% raw %}This Walking Code exercise demonstrates how to use the core to walk forward and backward. Walking backward helps to make a conscious connection between the mind and the body because we can't rely only on the body memory that we create as a child when we learn how to walk. Part 2 of this exercise, walking in a circle, will be posted separately. <br /><br />To sign up for The Walking Code Online Course you can you to www.toddmartinmd.com or you can click on the following link. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.movementsphere.com/the-walking-code">https://www.movementsphere.com/the-walking-code</a>{% endraw %}
