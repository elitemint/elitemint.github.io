{% raw %}The bridge is located under Niujiaoyan in Sinan County, Tongren City, Guizhou Province. From here, it is a 50-kilometer drive to Sinan County, and a 260-kilometer drive to the provincial capital of Guiyang.<br />It straddles the Wujiang River. To its north, there is a mountain called Niujiaoyan. There is a small village under the mountain, and the Wujiang River flows through this small village.<br />This Niujiaoyan Suspension Bridge is actually similar to the Luding Bridge in Sichuan, but compared with the Luding Bridge, it is much longer than the Luding Bridge. With a total length of 285 meters and a clear span of 238 meters, it has become the longest chain bridge in my country.<br /><br />The iron ropes are also covered with steel plates, and there are guardrails on both sides, so that people don't feel scared when driving past them.<br />This suspension bridge connects the two banks of the Wujiang River, and is the only river-crossing passage that is well-known in the area. It provides more convenient transportation conditions for the villagers nearby, facilitates the travel of the villagers, and greatly shortens the distance between the villagers on both sides of the strait by tens of kilometers.<br />Although this Niujiaoyan suspension bridge is not as famous as the Beipanjiang Bridge. But the special thing about this bridge is that the entire bridge only uses iron cables and has no piers. Because the bridge has no piers, the iron bridge shook very badly when the vehicle was driving on the bridge, and the iron plates made a terrifying creaking sound. Standing on it was scary and exciting.<br /><br />In addition, the volume of cargo vehicles passing through the bridge can reach 20 tons, and the number of people passing through each time reaches 200 people. I have to say that this is a bridge-building miracle and wisdom of the engineer.{% endraw %}
