{% raw %}This video is a job we did to repair the worn out main pivot positions on a tilt bucket and hitch for a Komatsu PC350 Excavator. This shows the step by step process to repair the bushing positions by line boring and bore welding using our Sir Meccanica WS2 portable line boring machine. After the positions are repaired we install the new flange-faced bushes using liquid nitrogen. We also show the steps to do a floating pin upgrade on the bucket then complete the job by putting the hitch and bucket together and install the floating pin.<br /><br />In this video we are using: <br />- Sir Meccanica WS2 Portable line boring machine <br />- WIA 500i Weldmatic welder<br />- Hafco TM-27120G Lathe<br />- Hafco TM-1740G Lathe<br /><br />Join our channel:<br />We upload new videos every Friday at 5pm AEST!
