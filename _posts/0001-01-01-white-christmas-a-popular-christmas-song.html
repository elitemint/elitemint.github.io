The song was written by Berlin for the musical film Holiday Inn, released in 1942. The composition won the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 15th Academy Awards.<br />Since its release, &quot;White Christmas&quot; has been covered by multiple artists, with the version sung by Bing Crosby being the world's best-selling single (in terms of sales of physical media) with estimated sales in excess of 50 million copies worldwide. When the figures for other versions of the song are added to Crosby's, sales of the song exceed 100 million.<br />Accounts vary as to when and where Berlin wrote the song. One story is that he wrote it in 1940, in warm La Quinta, California, while staying at the La Quinta Hotel, a frequent Hollywood retreat also favored by writer-director-producer Frank Capra, although the Arizona Biltmore also claims the song was written there. He often stayed up all night writing. One day he told his secretary, &quot;I want you to take down a song I wrote over the weekend. Not only is it the best song I ever wrote, it's the best song anybody ever wrote.&quot;<br /><br />The first public performance of the song was by Bing Crosby, on his NBC radio show The Kraft Music Hall on Christmas Day, 1941, a few weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor. A copy of the recording from the radio program is owned by Crosby's estate and was loaned to CBS News Sunday Morning for their December 25, 2011 program. He subsequently recorded the song with the John Scott Trotter Orchestra and the Ken Darby Singers at Radio Recorders for Decca Records in 18 minutes on May 29, 1942, and it was released on July 30 as part of an album of six 78-rpm discs from the musical film Holiday Inn. At first, Crosby did not see anything special about the song. He just said &quot;I don't think we have any problems with that one, Irving.&quot;<br />The version most often heard today on the radio during the Christmas season is the 1947 re-recording. The 1942 master was damaged due to frequent use. Crosby re-recorded the track on March 19, 1947, accompanied again by the Trotter Orchestra and the Darby Singers, with every effort made to reproduce the original recording session. The re-recording is recognizable by the addition of flutes and celesta in the beginning.<br />Although Crosby dismissed his role in the song's success, saying later that &quot;a jackdaw with a cleft palate could have sung it successfully&quot;,he was associated with it for the rest of his career.<br /><br />Since Christmas is my most wonderful time of the year, I asked my good friend and crooner Johnny Rosenberg to sing this song as a duet. Our voice matches perfectly. IT’s like Michael Bublé meets Sarah Brightman.<br />My love Rik directed the video.<br />“I wanted to bring an all-American feel to the song with Santa Clause making an appearance. Belinda is dreaming of a White Christmas and Johnny is bringing it to her! Somehow the mirror seems magical and in the end, we see that the whole snow scene was in a snow globe”<br /><br />This video is filmed and directed by Rik Sinkeldam.<br />Piano by Jan Willem Hoekstra<br />Jazzcombo by Richard Poot<br /><br /><br />⇩ More of #Belinda Vermeer ⇩<br />↪ Facebook : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BelindaVermeer">https://www.facebook.com/BelindaVermeer</a><br />↪ LinkedIN: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/belindavermeer">https://www.linkedin.com/company/belindavermeer</a><br />↪ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/belindavermeer/">https://www.instagram.com/belindavermeer/</a><br />↪ Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.belindavermeer.com">https://www.belindavermeer.com</a>{% endraw %}
