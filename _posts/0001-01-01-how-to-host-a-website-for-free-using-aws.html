{% raw %}Hosting Static Website with AWS S3 | Public Access<br /><br />⭐You can use Amazon S3 to host a static website. On a static website, individual webpages include static content. They might also contain client-side scripts.<br /><br />⭐To host a static website on Amazon S3, you configure an Amazon S3 bucket for website hosting and then upload your website content to the bucket. <br /><br />⭐When you configure a bucket as a static website, you must enable website hosting, set permissions, and create and add an index document. <br /><br />⭐Depending on your website requirements, you can also configure redirects, web traffic logging, and a custom error document.<br /><br />⭐ Kite is a free AI-powered coding assistant that will help you code faster and smarter.
