And at Neil Collins, Business English Training, people always ask me: &quot;What is the best English course for me?&quot; Well, every course has its advantages. And in this video, I'm going to tell you 3 reasons why you should do an intensive English course. <br /><br />With 20-30 hours of English in 1 week, you can become a lot more fluent. So, that happens very quickly. It makes you feel very positive and very confident. And that is an amazing start to a longer term learning programme. <br /><br />So, imagine you get a new client who wants to do a strategy meeting in English or you have a potential client who wants you to pitch your product and services in English. Of, for example, your boss says to you: &quot;Okay, I want you to go to that  trade fair in London next month.&quot; So for all of these situations, an intensive course is perfect to prepare you for that specific situation, for a presentation or for a big meeting or a trade fair. <br /><br />So maybe you're one of those people who has a crazy work schedule and you have no time for English. But in the summer, you have holidays and you can make use of your holidays. When you're on holiday, you're usually more relaxed. And when you're relaxed, you're more open to learning. So in that situation the intensive course would be perfect for you. <br /> <br /><br />So that's it. If you want to do an intensive course, just leave a comment below, or email me  at neil@neilcollins.de. Thanks a lot for watching and I'll see you soon.{% endraw %}
