At first glance, the women in the paintings all look the same, but they represent their society's definition of beauty. The bijinga tradition is said to have ended in the early 20th century, but in recent years, artist Yasunari Ikenaga has gained attention as a bijinga painter. Through his paintings, we dive into beauty and desire as defined by modern Japan.{% endraw %}
