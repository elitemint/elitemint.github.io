{% raw %}Hi All,<br /><br />A fairly hefty loss last time out, that's 2 on the trot at Party and to be honest, my luck at Betfred has not been much better either.<br /><br />I returned to Party to see if I could stop the rot.  I say rot, but the caveat is that I am still playing with a substantial balance from previous decent wins.  So swings and roundabouts then, and the losing run isn't a massive surprise given a downturn is inevitable in time.<br /><br />Today started rather well, but turned into hard work as I progressed.  I knew a reload was likely, and it was indeed required whilst playing Kong megaways.  Unfortunately I failed to land that game in the end, and it was rather a dent to the balance while I banged my head against a wall trying to bonus it!  For whatever reason, it is simply one of those games that I do not get on with.<br /><br />The second part of the bonus hunt continued in this vein, bonuses were hard to come by and I finished with just 7.  So it is a shorter video today, and a case of what might have been.  I suspect a loss, but hopefully not an absolute pasting.  These are the 7 charged with restoring my balance:<br /><br />Eternal Phoenix MW<br />Phoenix Forge<br />Mystic Chief<br />Rumble Rhino MW<br />Goonies Return<br />Tiki Infinity Reels MW<br />Buffalo King MW<br /><br />We shall see how it goes, but hopes are not particularly high. Please keep the feedback and suggestions coming, I shall be back once more before the weekend.<br /><br />#onlineslots #slots #bonushunt{% endraw %}
