{% raw %}Installing the electrical panel (load center) and distribution wiring (rough-in electrical), the subject of this week's video. Most of the interior wiring is complete, but I still have to run the wiring for the ceiling lights and exterior lights. It is nearly time to see if it all works. I plan to release a short video of the process I use to do that. <br /><br />Next week I will begin building the mechanical system (boiler, pumps, zone valves, controls, etc). I am looking forward to that. <br /><br />It is getting colder here now. The temperatures have been around 20 below zero every morning. I need to get the permanent heat turned on in the cabin as soon as possible. Up until now, I have been using only temporary space heaters which are not ideal. <br /><br />Thank you all for your tremendous support of this channel. In the past 9 months you have viewed these videos over 20 million times! I am so honored. <br /><br />Peace to you all from Alaska.{% endraw %}
