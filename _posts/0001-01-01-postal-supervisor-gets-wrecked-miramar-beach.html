{% raw %}POSTAL SUPERVISOR GETS WRECKED !! MIRAMAR BEACH FLORIDA - First Amendment Audit - Amagansett Press<br /><br />LINK TO AURORA, COLORADO FIRE SAFETY VIOLATIONS &amp; LEGENDARY ROASTING OF A COLORADO SHERIFF VIDEO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/JIu_Nbvx7F0">https://youtu.be/JIu_Nbvx7F0</a><br /><br />CHECK OUT WATCHING THE WATCHMEN'S CHANNEL HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/WatchingTheWatchmen">https://www.youtube.com/WatchingTheWatchmen</a><br /><br />U.S. Constitution NOT void where prohibited by law !!<br /><br />We believe that many of our rights and civil liberties as American citizens on American soil are at great risk and that a simple act of civil disobedience has the power to effect great change. While we have no interest or intention in breaking any law, we are willing to stand up for freedom and the constitution at any time and at any place and do so in a responsible and productive manner. It is our goal to create free and open discussion whenever possible in an effort to educate both ourselves and anyone with a desire to learn. A well known rule of government is that ignorance is no excuse for the law. It is our stand that we as Americans have been either uninformed or misinformed regarding our laws and rights for far too long. We are not attorneys or scholars, however we have been involved in professional photography for over 30 years and have had our rights and freedoms challenged more times than we can remember. No one group or person has the ability to effect change across the board, however we are committed to doing our part by continuing to stand up for our constitutional right to free press and the right to take photographs and video in public. All donations will be used exclusively to further this cause. We want to thank you in advance for your support of what we do and want you to know that we are committed to working harder than ever to defend our rights, your rights and the Freedom to Film in Public!!<br />Link to GoFundMe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/help-keep-amagansett-press-on-the-road&amp;rcid=r01-155101646049-01970d9110434a62&amp;pc=ot_co_campmgmt_w">https://www.gofundme.com/help-keep-amagansett-press-on-the-road&amp;rcid=r01-155101646049-01970d9110434a62&amp;pc=ot_co_campmgmt_w</a><br /><br />This video if for educational purposes only. <br />Unless otherwise specifically stated, all content, images and video are copyright 2009-2021 Amagansett Press (TM){% endraw %}
