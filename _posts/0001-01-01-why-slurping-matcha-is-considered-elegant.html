{% raw %}1. To tell the host you’re done drinking without speaking<br />2. To clean the bowl as much as possible<br /><br />At a tea ceremony, the guests will slurp their last sip of matcha making a big sound.<br /><br />Why would they do this? Doesn’t it sound a bit rude?<br /><br />The 4 kanji idiom that represents the principles of tea ceremony is 和敬清寂 wa-kei-sei-jyaku (created by Sen-no-Rikyu).<br /><br />和 wa means harmony, 敬 kei means respect, 清 sei means purity, and 寂 jaku means tranquility TRANQUILITY. The action of slurping matcha making a sound is especially deeply linked to the final “寂 jaku” tranquility.<br /><br />The purpose of the tea ceremony is to refine the spirit by feeling nature and becoming one with it, so we avoid useless conversation and all listen to the sounds of nature. After drinking the tea, the bowl must be returned to the host, but if you say... &quot;Hi! I'm done drinking!” out loud, it would ruin the atmosphere.<br /><br />By making the common sound of sipping the tea, you can let the host know that you have finished drinking and express your gratitude without speaking.<br /><br />Next, the guests should drink the matcha as cleanly as possible, because they will have a chance to flip over and see the beautiful tea bowls (especially chosen for the occasion). You of course need to avoid matcha dripping on the floor.<br /><br />▼Who is Shogo?
