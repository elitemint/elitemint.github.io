{% raw %}GothamFest is an opportunity for astronomers throughout NYC – at CCA, CUNY, AMNH, Columbia, NYU and other institutions – to come together to welcome new members, celebrate our science and make connections. Everyone is invited to attend and share something they are thinking about in a poster (undergrads and postdocs) or short talk (more advanced researchers).
