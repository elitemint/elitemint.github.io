{% raw %}Luca is a kid surrounded by screens. His parents capture every memory and milestone he goes through. He grows up to find love through a screen and ends up raising his child the same way his parents did. Life seems to be a repetitive cycle until Luca's newborn reminds him of a long-lost memory that touches him deeply.{% endraw %}
