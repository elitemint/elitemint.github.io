Build some instant equity if you are a handy person who can do your own plumbing, electrical, and finish carpenter work. This 24 X 24 cabin on the Penobscot River is a weather tight shell ready for you to finish.<br /><br />The 576 square foot cabin was built in 2020. It is sided, roofed, and has doors and windows installed. The trussed roof system allows for an open floor plan. Frame up the interior walls where you want them or leave it as a large open space, your choice. A wood subfloor is in place. The cabin sets on a gravel pad with concrete posts. A river side deck makes for a good spot to have a BBQ and enjoy the river views and the view of Long Island.<br /><br />Electricity is roadside and can easily be connected to the cabin. An existing drilled well is next to the cabin and a 2-bedroom septic design is available for the new owner. This lot has mostly level cleared land with a nice path to the river’s edge. 200± feet of water and road frontage comes with the property. The riverbank is lined with hardwood trees.<br /><br />The Penobscot River is Maine’s largest river and the second largest river in New England. The cabin is located on the main stem of the river about 65 miles north of its confluence with the Atlantic Ocean. This part of the Penobscot is known as one of the top smallmouth bass fisheries in the United States. The boating opportunities are excellent for those who enjoy exploring the many river channels by canoe, kayak or motorboats. A boat landing is located just one mile south of the cabin and another about 4 miles north.<br /><br />Passadumkeag is a rural town of approximate 375 residence located 32 miles north of Bangor, Maine. The town is part of the SAU 31 school system. The town has a below average tax rate making it one of the more affordable places for property tax in Maine.<br /><br />If you need more information or would like to schedule a visit to the cabin, call Phil McPhail today at (800) 286-6164.{% endraw %}
