The new T-Roc boasts a more confident and sporty tailgate with a number plate positioned in the back bumper.<br /><br />Up front has a familiar Volkswagen fare, with a large grille dominated by a vast VW badge. The slender headlamps are a nod to the Tiguan but re-imagined with separate LED daytime running lights. The T-Roc looks more aggressive than current VW SUVs thanks to a wide front grille with a chrome strip running all the way around the headlights. Top-spec models have full-LED lights and the daytime running lights double as indicators for a distinctive front-end look.<br /><br />Interior<br /><br />A large strip of plastic stretches across the dashboard and, depending on the model you go for, comes in a variation of colours. The colourful inserts continue down the centre console and can be seen in the doors as well. The T-Roc really does combine elegance with practicality, with a spacious interior and ample boot space- perfect for the modern family.<br /><br />Technology<br /><br />The T-Roc comes as standard with plenty of modern safety systems such as automatic emergency braking with pedestrian recognition, a lane-keeping system and post-collision braking. Adaptive cruise control is optionally available along with adaptive dampers that let you firm or relax the suspension at the push of a button depending on driving conditions.<br /><br />As standard, the T-Roc gets a 6.5-inch touchscreen infotainment system borrowed from the Golf, meaning it’s responsive and one of the easiest touchscreen systems to use while on the move.<br /><br />Move up to the mid-range eight-inch system with a glass screen and you get the option of VW’s App Connect that adds Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Mirrorlink.<br /><br />Moving to the top-spec infotainment system (which is also eight-inches in size) you’ll get satellite navigation. Along with it, access to online features such as news bulletins, the weather forecast, fuel stations around you as well as closest car parks with prices and availability of spaces.<br /><br />Performance<br /><br />Three petrol and three diesel engines are available for the T-Roc, coming in three power levels – 115, 150 and 190hp. Entry-level models will use a 1.0-litre petrol or a 1.6-litre diesel that both make 115hp. They’re also the only engines in the lineup that are strictly front-wheel drive and come with a manual gearbox only.<br /><br />Mid-range 150hp 1.5-litre petrol and 2.0-litre diesel models can be optionally equipped with a seven-speed DSG automatic gearbox as well as VW’s 4Motion four-wheel-drive system.<br /><br />The most powerful engines, at 190hp, will dispatch overtakes with laughable ease and appeal more to keen drivers.{% endraw %}
