{% raw %}I do not own this audio! All rights and credit go to the band Means! <br />I only uploaded this for people to enjoy their music, <br /><br />LYRICS: <br />We can see so far across the sky <br />We can see so far from here <br />Across the water <br />We can see the tops of the trees <br />I'm holding my arms out steadily <br />I'm keeping my first secure <br /><br />To keep me from sinking <br />To keep me from falling to sleep <br />Without even a wonder <br />In this evening, just fading away <br /><br />And if the water comes up to our necks <br />And it's easier just to give in <br />I will remember what I learned before the flooding came <br />I will remember who I was before the walls gave way. <br /><br />To keep me from sinking <br />To keep me from falling to sleep <br />Without even a wonder <br />In this evening, just fading away{% endraw %}
