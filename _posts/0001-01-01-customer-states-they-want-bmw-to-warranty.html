Vehicle was a Mitsubishi Outlander Sport. Unsure on year.<br />0:51 Did not receive any more info regarding this clip, but I'm very curious if somebody actually told the customer to add engine oil in the coolant reservoir. <br />1:13 Let's hope nobody was holding that shovel, when it happened.<br />No more info regarding this photo.<br />1:21 From the looks of it, the customer bent some tie rod ends and damaged some engine mounts. Look's to be a 2012+ Ford Focus.<br />1:40 Mechanic said, if he remembers correctly the vehicle was a 1998 KIA Sportage. <br />1:47 That's the crankshaft damper/pulley that came off. Since it's missing the serpentine belt, the alternator won't charge the battery and the power supply warning came up on the infotainment systems to notify the driver.<br />2:02 Mechanic just randomly found this under a customer's 2015 Hyundai Elantra. Mechanic said it's just a generic GPS Tracker you can find on Amazon. <br />2:12 Racoon was okay and had it's broken leg fixed. <br />2:25 PTO, PTU or transfer case. People call them all different things. <br />A PTU is basically a transfer case that always spins and mounts on the right hand side of the transaxle. To prevent issues, it's highly recommend to change the fluid in the PTU very often since all the components inside spin all the time. <br />2:38 This was actually filmed where I live lol. Drive safe people!<br />2:49 Just thought it was cool enough to share. <br />2:57 Outro. Thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
