{% raw %}Dylan's passionate reworking of &quot;To Be Alone With You&quot; turns a straightforward love song from 1969's Nashville Skyline into something more complicated:<br />    A bit mystical, perhaps?<br />    And, dare I say, a tad creepy?  <br />   &quot;To be alone with you, even for just an hour, in a castle high, in an ivory tower...&quot;  - Lovely.<br />   &quot;I'll hound you to death, that's just what I'll do...&quot;   - Is that a promise or a threat?  Sounds kind of &quot;stalky.&quot;<br />    Then that last mysterious verse:  &quot;What happened to me, darling?/What was it ya saw?/ Did I kill somebody?/Did I escape the law?/ Ya know, my heart's in my mouth / My eyes are still blue...&quot;<br />    The last line could be a throw-away - or, Bob bringing it all back home with a nod to Hank Williams.  As in, &quot;Why don't you love me like you used to do?/ Why do you treat me like a worn-out shoe?/ My hair is still curly and my eyes are still blue/ Why don't you love me like you used to do?&quot;<br />    My opinion for what it's worth.<br /><br />But, no matter.  Whatever you take from it, the song is yet another powerful performance from an outstanding tour.  May we all have that much focus and energy when we're 80 - and have as much fun as Dylan certainly seems to be on stage!{% endraw %}
