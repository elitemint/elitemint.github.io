{% raw %}Grounding, calming, slow shamanic drumming meditation. Going back to our roots, to our inner calmness. Focus.  Our emotions are drifting away like waves. Slow shamanic drumming, rainstick and little bit of kalimba.  Grounding with the Spirit and Wisdom of the Mother Earth. <br />Blessings and gratitude üôèüê≥ Calm Whale<br />‚ù§Ô∏è Much love<br /><br />‚ñ∫ Support me &amp; DOWNLOAD high quality music file  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whaleloryb.bandcamp.com/album/air-fire-grounding-meditation">https://whaleloryb.bandcamp.com/album/air-fire-grounding-meditation</a><br />‚ñ∫ become my PATRON, You can subscribe there and download every new track I publish  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/calmwhale">https://www.patreon.com/calmwhale</a><br />‚ñ∫ or just DONATE and help me create music sending some amount to my PayPal music@kalm.in (please add info in the comment that this is a donation) or <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/calmwhales">https://www.paypal.me/calmwhales</a><br /><br />#air&amp;fire #calmwhale #grounding #rootchakra <br /><br />Subscribe to my channel:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/xvZCV9">https://goo.gl/xvZCV9</a><br /><br />Everything made exclusively by Calm Whale.<br /><br />Copyright ‚ìí 2021 CalmWhale‚Ñ¢.
