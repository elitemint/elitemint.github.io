{% raw %}Video on How many types of pregnancy delivery methods, or Different Types of childbirth options.<br /><br />Bringing a baby into this world is a monumental feat and cannot be achieved easily. <br />An easy birth and a perfectly executed birth plan is ideal. <br />But we know that even the most carefully planned birth can take twists and turns. In those cases, it's important to be prepared for alternative delivery methods.<br /><br />Although there is a typical way for a baby to be born, with advances in medical sciences, multiple types of baby delivery have been formulated so that the delivery can be made successful even in the face of any complications or risks.<br /><br />1) Vaginal Delivery<br />In normal delivery, the baby is born through the  birth canal. In this type of delivery, it is very difficult to predict when you can go into labor but generally women give birth between 37-40 weeks of pregnancy.<br />Most doctors recommend for having a vaginal birth if there is a possibility for it. For mothers planning to have multiple children, vaginal births are highly recommended. When done with an incision above the area, the procedure is called episiotomy.<br /><br />With vaginal deliveries, mothers can recover from the stress of delivery in shorter time and, hence, can return home with their babies soon. The chances of infection in such cases are lower than others. The baby, too, has a lower chance of suffering from any breathing problems if born via the vagina.<br /><br />2) Caesarean (C-section) delivery<br />Not everything always goes according to plan in real life. One might want to undertake vaginal delivery but complications could arise. In such a case, caesarean delivery is an option that might be taken.<br />In this type of delivery, the baby is born through surgical incision on the abdomen and uterus of the mother. C-section  delivery method may be pre-planned or can be performed as an emergency in response to any complications.<br />Many mothers decide to have caesarean in advance, which allows the hospital and doctors to start making preparations accordingly. This could be out of choice or even after sonography has revealed certain parameters which make it necessary to undertake a C-section, such as the presence of twins or triplets, or a very large baby.<br />In other cases, if vaginal delivery fails or any complication arises, such as breech position while delivering or obstruction in the birth canal, the doctors will have to quickly resort to undertaking a C-section and removing the baby out of the uterus in time.<br /><br /><br />3) Vacuum Extraction<br />This type of delivery technique is again used in the case of a vaginal birth. The baby is on its way out but somehow has stopped moving any further through the canal.<br />During vacuum extraction , The doctors make use of a specialized vacuum pump which is inserted up to the baby via the canal. The vacuum end has a soft cup which is placed on the top of the baby’s head. Vacuum is created so that the cup holds the head and the baby is gently guided outwards through the canal.<br /><br />4) Forceps Delivery<br />Forceps delivery is used during the course of vaginal birth . In these cases, a doctor makes use of specially created tongs, which resemble forceps and insert them slowly in the birth canal. These are then used to gently grab the baby’s head and start guiding it outwards through the canal.<br /><br />This is a rather peculiar type of delivery method and is required in certain cases of vaginal birth. This is an addition to the usual vaginal delivery when the baby is on its way via the birth canal but fails to fully emerge out. This could be because of any small obstructions, or the mother being tired and losing consciousness, hence unable to push the baby out.<br /><br />5) Vaginal Birth after Caesarean (VBAC)<br />Smaller hospitals do not opt for VBAC since an emergency C-section could suddenly require more staff and resources which may not be always possible. Also, any previous complications during delivery or any conditions in the mother could make the doctor advise you against a vaginal delivery.<br /><br />That is all about this video.
