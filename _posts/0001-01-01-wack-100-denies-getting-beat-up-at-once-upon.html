{% raw %}During a Clubhouse conversation, Wack 100 admitted he got into an altercation at the Once Upon A Time festival in Los Angeles.  The same festival during which Drakeo The Ruler was stabbed to death. The way Wack said it, he was kicking ass and taking names in the fight. However, footage posted by 40 Glocc, who recently did a bid for pimping, suggests that Wack bore the brunt of the abuse in the altercation and was even disrespectfully sprayed by a fire extinguisher. It's hard to tell exactly who's stomping who in the videos, and 40 Glocc would have animosity toward Wack since Wack manages The Game, who famously beat Glocc down on video. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hiphoplately.com/wack-100-caught-lying-about-fight-before-drakeo-the-ruler-got-stabbed/">https://www.hiphoplately.com/wack-100-caught-lying-about-fight-before-drakeo-the-ruler-got-stabbed/</a><br /><br />Troi Torain aka STAR is a multimedia personality whose career has spanned the arenas of radio, television and the world-wide web.
