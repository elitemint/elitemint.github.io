{% raw %}Our knowledge and practice of teaching reading has changed dramatically since most adults were taught to read.  This means families with children learning to read often find themselves in a learning curve of new terms and ideas. <br /><br />This video aims to help everyone involved a childâ€™s learning, to understand the important role of decoding in reading, and understand how it works. It looks at what happens in the brain, and how we use this information when we teach children to read. <br /><br /><br /><br />_______________________ <br />Stock footage: Pexels.com including videos by cottonbro from Pexels<br />Music: My Dog is Happy by Reed Matthis{% endraw %}
