{% raw %}Be sure to choose the correct weight of zip for the garment.  A minimum of 2cm seam allowance is advisable for a zip insertion.<br /><br />Make the seam allowance below the zipper, overlock or zig-zag the edge of the seam allowances, press the seam allowance open and press or tack the zipper fitting line before you begin the zip insertion.<br /><br />1. Using a 2cm seam allowance, stitch the seam from end of the seam to below the zipper opening and backstitch.  (Optional, you may change the stitch length to the longest length, [baste] stitch to the top of the seam, snip the threads above the backstitch for ease of removal later.) <br /><br />2. Operlock or zig-zag the edges and press an open seam.  (Remove the optional  [basting] stitches.<br /><br />3. Place right side of zip to wrong side of garment.  Align the top of the zip to the top of the opening and so that the teeth is just inside the edge of the opening, (approx 2 to 3mm).<br /><br />4. Use the foot where the needle is closest to the zip.  Also, use the foot as a guide to stitch from the edge of the zip to stitch a straight line.  Close to the bottom of the zip, leave the needle in the garment, lift the foot and pull the tab &amp; slider past the foot.  Continue to stitch to the bottom of the zip.<br /><br />5. At the bottom of the zip length, leave the needle in the fabric, lift the foot and pivot the garment at right angle.  Stitch to the seam line -- counting the number of stitches.  Count the same number of stitches across the seam line, pivot and stitch to the top of the zipper aligning the zip as the previous side.<br /><br />6. Top press and under-press for a professional finish.<br /><br />Only press the seam to avoid overpressing the entire garment.<br /><br />Credits:<br />Producing/Demonstrating: Claudette Davis-Bonnick<br />Filming: Nick Sargent<br />Editing: Kenny MacLeod<br />Stills: Nick Sargent, Junior Bonnick<br />Thanks to: Oliver Furlong, Media Services, CLIP CETL &quot;Making a Difference&quot; funding at the London College of Fashion{% endraw %}
