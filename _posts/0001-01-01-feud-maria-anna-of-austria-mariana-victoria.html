{% raw %}Maria Anna of Austria and Mariana Victoria of Bourbon were both queens of Portugal for best part of the 18th century. More than that, they were family, mother and daughter in law. <br /><br />For a quarter of a century, they lived in the court of Lisbon in a proximity that went from love to hate in just a few years. Maria Anna of Austria controlled every aspect of her daughter in laws life, and Mariana Victoria resented her dippy for it.<br /><br />But their relationship is much more complex than that, not only did they come from extremely different backgrounds, one was Austrian and the other one Spanish, their experiences in the Portuguese court were a clear contrast, just like their personalities. <br /><br />But in the end, they had more in commune than they might have thought. <br /><br />So, on this video, I am going to try to find out what was the relationship between these two women like and the causes for their feud. <br /><br />#18thcentury #history #feud<br /><br />Sourses:<br /><br />- Drumond Braga, Paulo (2018).
