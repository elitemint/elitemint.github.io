The group combines R&amp;B, jazz, and hip-hop in their music. With great emotion and sensuality, the group has recorded such favorite hits as &quot;Be Patient,&quot; &quot;Tell Me,&quot; and &quot;Don't Let Go.&quot; Assorted Phlavors began in the early '90s when the members were still in high school. All the members brought experience and a new sound to the group. Garrison had performed both in church and high school, and then she met Bryant, who was born and raised in Yonkers, NY, and had been singing and performing since the age of 12. With the addition of Phinazee and Johnson, a new vocal group was formed. Phinazee had performed both in high school and publicly. She won first prize at an Apollo Theater amateur night. Johnson graduated from the Westchester Conservatory of Music. Under the name Essence, the group won a talent contest and decided to try their hand at recording publicly. After signing with Hall of Fame Records in 1995, the vocalists changed the name of the group to Assorted Phlavors. The group's image was gospel-oriented but was changed when the name changed; they became stronger and more versatile. The group's debut album is titled Assorted Phlavors. Combining jazz, classical, R&amp;B, and hip-hop, the album saw immediate success. Produced by Dave &quot;Jam&quot; Hall, it contains the hits &quot;First You Said,&quot; a ballad, &quot;Don't Let Go,&quot; a lover's song mixed with soul, &quot;Hiding Place,&quot; featuring vocals by dancer Patra, and &quot;Trust,&quot; written by Gordon Chambers and first released on the Anita Bryant Brownstone label. The song &quot;Hiding Place&quot; was first featured on the Money Train soundtrack. &quot;Love Ballad&quot; was first released in 1976 under the title of the same name. Assorted Phlavors' success is the result of the combination of harmony, emotion, and sensuality in all of their songs and albums. All four members contribute something different to the group, but all hold the same passion for singing.
