{% raw %}The shotgun world is a mess of old standards &amp; notations, and nowhere is this more evident than the way we define bore diameters.  Just about everyone is familiar with terms such as 12-gauge or 20-gauge, but what exactly does gauge mean, and how does it translate to an actual diameter?<br /><br />This video explains the history and math behind the gauge system used to define shotgun bores, and discusses the shotshell sizes in use today.<br /><br />Please note that any comments on the relative popularity and availability of the shotshell sizes and loads discussed here are from a North American perspective.  Things may be different in other parts of the world.<br /><br />The Shotguns 101 video series focuses on general shotgun topics.  I already have a lot of ideas for future videos, but I'd still like to hear any suggestions you might have.  <br /><br />I recommend watching this video with the annotations turned on. I'll be adding various notes to provide further details and address some common questions and potential points of confusion.  There will be no giant flags blocking the video, and absolutely no begging for subscriptions or likes. <br /><br />Shotguns 101 Playlist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzPVXnz7gkEWz4JXaAQ7zEeWVBsaN4c3K">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzPVXnz7gkEWz4JXaAQ7zEeWVBsaN4c3K</a><br /><br />Remington 870 Tips &amp; Tricks Playlist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzPVXnz7gkEXSPRg6bGdbquEwfJFupUYL">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzPVXnz7gkEXSPRg6bGdbquEwfJFupUYL</a><br /><br />PROGRAMS USED:<br /><br />Adobe Reader 9<br />Audacity<br />AVS Video Editor 6.3<br />Google Chrome<br />Microsoft Excel<br />Microsoft PowerPoint<br />Microsoft Word <br />Rhinoceros 3.0<br />Windows Paint<br />Windows Picture and Fax Viewer<br /><br />DISCLAIMERS:<br /><br />By accessing this video, the viewer signifies their understanding of, consent to, and agreement with the following:<br /><br />All products and copyrighted works mentioned or shown herein remain the property of their respective creators and/or owners.
