{% raw %}Here is a new narration redub I have had planned for a week or so.<br /><br />Percy is chosen to pick up a new carpet and take it to the Flower Show. But ends up in a chase when his carpet flies away from train to train and then lands on the track. Thanks to a 'Magic Carpet' talk with Salty, Percy tries to save his magic carpet from causing trouble. He then saves Thomas from a crash and the Fat Controller is releived to see Percy arrive safe and sound. But Gordon isn't so sure if the carpet is magic at all.<br /><br />I own nothing on this video.<br /><br />Footage, sounds and music are copyrighted by HiT Entertainment &amp; Lionsgate.{% endraw %}
