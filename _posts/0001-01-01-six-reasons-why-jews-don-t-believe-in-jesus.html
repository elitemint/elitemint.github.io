Genealogy in the Bible is only passed down from father to son (Numbers 1:1-18).<br /><br />There is no evidence that Jesus really had this pedigree, and the Christian Bible actually claims that he did not have a “birth-father” from the tribe of Judah descending from King David and King Solomon (Matt. 1:18-20).<br /><br />Reason #2 – Ingathering of the Jewish Exiles – Jesus did not do this.<br /><br />When the Messiah is reigning as King of Israel, the Jews will be ingathered from their exile and will return to Israel, their homeland (Deut. 30:3; Isaiah 11:11-12; Jeremiah 30:3, 32:37; Ezekiel 11:17, 36:24).<br />This has clearly not yet happened and we still await its fulfillment.<br /><br />Reason #3– Rebuilding of the Holy Temple – Jesus failed to achieve this.<br /><br />The Temple in Jerusalem will be rebuilt (Isaiah 2:2-3, 56:6-7, 60:7, 66:20; Ezekiel 37:26–27; Malachi 3:4; Zech. 14:20-21).<br /><br />The Temple was still standing in Jesus’ day. It was destroyed 38 years after Jesus’ crucifixion and it has not yet been rebuilt.<br /><br />Reason #4– Worldwide Reign of Peace – Jesus did not accomplish this.<br /><br />There will be universal disarmament and worldwide peace with a complete end to war (Micah 4:1-4; Hoseah 2:20; Isaiah 2:1-4, 60:18).<br /><br />Wars have increased dramatically in the world since the start of Christianity.<br /><br />Reason #5 – Observance of the Torah Embraced by All Jews – Jesus didn’t bring this about.<br /><br />The Messiah will reign as King at a time when all the Jewish people will observe G-d’s commandments (Ezekiel 37:24; Deut. 30:8,10; Jeremiah 31:32; Ezekiel 11:19-20, 36:26-27).<br /><br />Jesus never ruled as King, nor have all Jews embraced the commandments of G-d’s Torah.<br /><br />Reason #6 – Universal Knowledge of G-d – Jesus clearly failed here also.<br /><br />The Messiah will rule at a time when all the people of the world will come to acknowledge and serve the one true G-d (Zechariah 3:9, 8:23,14:9,16; Isaiah 45:23, 66:23; Jeremiah 31:33; Ezekiel 38:23; Psalm 86:9; Zeph. 3:9).<br /><br />This, as well, has not yet taken place and we await its fulfillment. <br /><br />No matter how many unusual &amp; miraculous things Jesus seems to accomplish in the New Testament, he doesn't fulfill even one of the 6 criteria by which the Nation of Israel can recognize him as the true Jewish Messiah.<br /><br />To find out more go to www.jewsforjudaism.ca<br /><br />●<br /><br />JEWS FOR JUDAISM is an outreach organization whose primary goal is to win back to Judaism those Jews who have been influenced by the following six threats to Jewish survival that are devastating the global Jewish community.<br /><br />1. Hebrew-Christian missionaries convert thousands of Jews worldwide every year<br />2. Destructive cults cause many Jews to abandon family, friends and careers<br />3. Eastern religions, Buddhism and Hinduism are spiritual choices for many Jews<br />4. Apathy and ignorance leave many Jews unaware, unaffiliated and assimilated <br />5. Intermarriage is exploding with a 75% rate in some North American cities<br />6. Anti-Israel BDS on campus inhibits Jewish students from standing up for Israel and Judaism<br /><br />To assist non-Jews who have left other religions, JEWS FOR JUDAISM also provides educational programs to help them embrace the Torah’s Seven Noachide Laws for Gentiles.<br /><br />We achieve our goals through our worldwide Internet outreach, Social Media, free educational programs, educational literature and counseling services that connect Jewish people to the spiritual depth, beauty and wisdom of Judaism.<br /><br />“I am so grateful to have discovered the wonderful Jews for Judaism YouTube lectures by Rabbi Skobac. I am a Jew who converted to Christianity in college, but now, thanks to your online outreach, I have returned to Judaism. Thank you.” – Rebecca G.<br /><br />In a nutshell, Jews for Judaism saves Jewish lives and keeps Jews Jewish.<br /><br />PLEASE SUPPORT JEWS FOR JUDAISM’S LIFE-SAVING WORK!<br />Your help is very much needed and greatly appreciated. <br />Jews for Judaism never charges for its programs, books and counseling services… ever. <br />We rely solely on donations from people like you.<br />To donate click here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.canadahelps.org/dn/24741">https://www.canadahelps.org/dn/24741</a><br /><br />Thank you very much.<br /><br />JEWS FOR JUDAISM <br />3110 Bathurst St, PO Box 54042, <br />Toronto, ON, CANADA M6A 3B7<br />T: 416-789-0020 • F: 416-789-0030{% endraw %}
