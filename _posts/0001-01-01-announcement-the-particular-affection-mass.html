{% raw %}ANNOUNCEMENT E.SY. ELLINON SYNELEYSIS CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION OF THE REGION ABROAD<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.esykpdeksoteriko.com/">http://www.esykpdeksoteriko.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.e-sy.gr/join/">https://www.e-sy.gr/join/</a><br /><br />THE PARTICULAR AFFECTION MASS MEDIA EXPRESSES TOWARDS ARTEMIS SORRAS<br /><br />The continuous attempt at defaming Artemis Sorras, the President of the legalised and approved Political Body “ELLINON SYNELEYSIS”, has sparked great interest.<br />As we are aware, this has predominantly occurred the last few days on the newscasts of the large systemic networks with a new wave of smear campaigns, lies and the defamation of the Political Body of the Hellenic Nation. The Mainstream Media and their “well-known” journalists are deviously attempting to connect the Political Body with the incitement in favour or against vaccinations regarding the Covid 19 pandemic as well as with extremist elements and organisations. <br />Why are they targeting Artemis Sorras and Ellinon Syneleysis? Is it because the only opponent that the governing regime fears is the unity of the Hellenes? Is this why they granted millions to the Mainstream Media Channels so that they can protect them with their propaganda?<br />This is always the same recipe with the purpose of misleading the Greek citizens.<br />Once again, we boldly declare to all that:<br />We have no relation and disclaim any association with groups, movements or publications on social media or other, which openly or covertly incite, motivate or provoke the Greek citizens to legal or other types of actions and reactions related to the Covid 19 pandemic and whatever this entails. And every other instigation that conflicts with the free will of the people.<br />The respect of the intellect and free will of every human, citizen of Greece and abroad is an inviolable Principle of ours.<br />The aim and purpose of the anthropocentric organisation “ELLINON SYNELEYSIS” is the unity of every citizen without any discrimination as per the AXIAL System of 33 PROTOCOLS that have been earthed and inscribed by the President of the Political Body, Mr. Artemis Sorras for all of humanity. In this way and united, we can all establish the HELLENIC STATE with VALUES, PRINCIPLES and STATE LAWS reinstating true DEMOCRACY.<br />Discriminating schemes and the polarisation of citizens belong to the political parties and their regimental mechanisms such as the Mainstream Media that act as their intermediaries, executing their orders for the purpose of “divide and conquer”.<br />We call for the complete restoration and reinstatement of the Truth of Justice by all who spread false news, relentlessly insulting and slandering Artemis Sorras and “ELLINON SYNELEYSIS”, the only true representation of the Hellenic Nation.{% endraw %}
