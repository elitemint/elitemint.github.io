{% raw %}Once brexit became reality, the government had to switch from grand promises about what the project would bring to hiding the damage that it would actually bring. The pandemic gave the Conservatives an opportunity to hide some of the damage, but most people don't seem to be fooled. A recent poll is showing that a majority of voters can see the harm that brexit is doing to the UK. This is only likely to increase as 2022 brings even more damaging brexit systems, like the customs controls that are not actually working right now.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/adifferentbias">https://www.patreon.com/adifferentbias</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Philmoorhouse76">https://twitter.com/Philmoorhouse76</a><br />Customs article: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/brexit-food-imports-government-b1984912.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/brexit-food-imports-government-b1984912.html</a><br />Poll article: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-poll-boris-johnson-lies-b1980372.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-poll-boris-johnson-lies-b1980372.html</a>{% endraw %}
