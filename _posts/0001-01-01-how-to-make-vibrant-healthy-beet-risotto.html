{% raw %}ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://chfstps.co/3EebUOm">https://chfstps.co/3EebUOm</a><br /><br />For this vibrant, healthy take on the Italian staple, we use the whole dang beet to create a ruby-red-and-emerald dish with fresh, bright flavors and a remarkable creamy texture that utterly belies its vegan status. (Vegan, that is, unless you choose to top with some fresh parmesanâ€”and, oh, we do.) Though itâ€™s not necessary to use beet juice as cooking liquid (you can substitute any portion of stock or water instead), we love how the super-absorbent short-grain rice soaks up the earthy beet flavor and turns the rice an eye-popping magenta. And we particularly love how satisfied we feel when we use every part of the vegetable to get the job done.<br /><br />Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://chefsteps.com">https://chefsteps.com</a> for more recipes, techniques and cooking classes.{% endraw %}
