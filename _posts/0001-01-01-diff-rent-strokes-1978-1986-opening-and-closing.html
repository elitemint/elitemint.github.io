The series stars Gary Coleman and Todd Bridges as Arnold and Willis Jackson, two African American boys from Harlem who are taken in by a rich white Park Avenue businessman and widower named Phillip Drummond (Conrad Bain) and his daughter Kimberly (Dana Plato), for whom their deceased mother previously worked. During the first season and first half of the second season, Charlotte Rae also starred as the Drummonds' housekeeper, Mrs. Garrett (who ultimately spun off into her own successful show, The Facts of Life).<br /><br />The series made stars out of child actors Gary Coleman, Todd Bridges, and Dana Plato and became known for the &quot;very special episodes&quot; in which serious issues such as racism, illegal drug use, and child sexual abuse were dramatically explored.<br /><br />The lives of these stars were later plagued by legal troubles and drug addiction. In 1994, Coleman appeared in an episode of Married... with Children, playing a building code inspector whom Al Bundy called to report an illegal driveway. When Kelly recognizes him, he denies any connection to Arnold Jackson, but utters his catchphrase to Al, &quot;What'chu talkin' about, Bundy?&quot;. Also, in 1996, Coleman and Bain reprised their roles for the series finale of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air entitled &quot;I, Done Part 2&quot;. In their scene, they reference Willis by name before meeting Will Smith's character, leading to Coleman uttering a variation of his catchphrase, &quot;What'chu talkin' about, Willis?&quot;.<br /><br />Following the cancellation of Diff'rent Strokes, Gary Coleman, Todd Bridges, and Dana Plato encountered difficulty in obtaining acting jobs. All three experienced various legal problems while Bridges and Plato also struggled with drug addictions, all of which were documented in the press. The press and fans of the series blamed the cast's personal problems and faltering careers on what was eventually dubbed the &quot;curse of Diff'rent Strokes&quot; by various tabloids.{% endraw %}
