{% raw %}Hey guys!!<br />A while back I hit 1 million followers on TikTok and since it is my absolute favourite platform I thought I would give you guys some tips that I have learned over time that really made a difference for me.  <br />I will mention everything from how often to post to how to really find what works for you so you can optimize your engagement with your audience! And if you want to know how much money someone with a million followers gets in their TikTok creator fund, then this is the video for you!!<br /><br />As always I really want to give you guys the inside perspective on things you guys are curious about, so if there is anything else you would want me to make a video about, then please let me know down below. And I’m also really curious about you guys, through what platform did you find me and were you already aware of my TikTok account? What is your favourite content to watch across the different platforms? <br /><br />Here you can find my TikTok: [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@xeniaadonts/]">https://www.tiktok.com/@xeniaadonts/]</a> <br /><br />Instagram: [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/xeniaadonts/]">https://www.instagram.com/xeniaadonts/]</a><br /><br />Music intro credit: ‘Every High’ by Kyson (check it out!!! such a good song){% endraw %}
