Ava has just died and while she awaits for her consciousness to be downloaded into a new body, she must deal with &quot;computer&quot; who is...difficult to say the least. But as the wait continues and the tensions grow, Ava realizes that things aren't as they seem. Something sinister? Maybe -- or maybe the her best friend Rebecca is messing with her. At least, please let that be true. Ava in the End is a black-comedy that asks the question: what if at the end of your life the only company you had was an annoying artificial intelligence who won't shut the &amp;*$# up.  <br /><br />&quot;Ava In The End&quot; Credits:<br />Starring Elsa Gay and Allie Gallerani <br />Written/Executive Producer: Addison Heimann <br />Directed/Edited/Producer: Ursula Ellis<br />Producer: Rebecca Shuhan Lou<br />Producer: John Lozada<br />Executive Producer: Lily Pham<br />Executive Producer: Nam Kapow Luong Associate Producer: Desiree Stables<br />1st AD: Jessie Cohen<br />Script Supervisor: Chloe Williams<br />Director of Photography: Travis Labella<br />1st AC: Taylor Harris<br />Camera PA: Dalton Odell<br />Gaffer: Matt Planer<br />Key Grip: JD Howell<br />Swing: Matthew Chubby<br />Production Assistants: Isis Carranza, Lillian Cuba Production Sound: Christopher Cole<br />Boom Operator: Amanda Lowry<br />Sound Design/Mix: Isaac S.
