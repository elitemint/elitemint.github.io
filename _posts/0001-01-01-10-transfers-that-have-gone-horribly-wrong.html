{% raw %}► SPONSOR THIS VIDEO: footballdailyuk@gmail.com<br /><br />For today’s top ten, we’re running through ten transfers made this summer that just haven’t gone to plan. PSG splashed the cash but there’s rumours Sergio Ramos’ career there could end before he even steps foot on the pitch, whilst Monaco’s Myron Boadu isn’t providing the goals his Eredivisie form suggested he would. Jannik Vestergaard is yet to start in a win for Leicester City, and Weston McKennie could already be on his way out of Juventus despite only becoming a permanent player of theirs last window. Barcelona and Sergio Aguero got off to a very rocky start, as has Andre Silva at RB Leipzig. Emi Buendia is not replicating his Norwich form at Aston Villa, and Donyell Malen is yet to score since his arrival at Borussia Dortmund. The man he replaced, Jadon Sancho is out of form, out of favour and soon to be out of position at Manchester United, and then there’s the curious case of Saul Niguez – the Spaniard joined Chelsea on loan but barely has a half of football to his name.
