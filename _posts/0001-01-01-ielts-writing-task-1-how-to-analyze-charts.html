{% raw %}In this IELTS Writing Task 1 lesson, you'll learn how to accurately analyze charts, maps, and process diagrams. I explain how you can use a question checklist to practice your Task 1 analysis abilities. I also give an example of each kind of Task 1 data set.<br /><br />Here are the checklist questions from the video:<br /><br />Instructions: To improve your ability to analyze Task 1 data, use the questions below when you see a new graph, chart, map, or process diagram. After youâ€™re comfortable with the checklists, gradually try to use them less and less until you can analyze the data more easily.<br /><br />Graph or Chart:<br />What are the axes (x and y)? <br />What are the units of measurement? (e.g. amount, %, age, etc.)<br />Is there more than one group being compared? (e.g. 3 different countries)<br />Does it show change over time? (this is common for graphs)<br />What are the time periods shown? (past, present, future)<br />What is the general trend? (increase, decrease, etc.)<br />Are there any large differences between groups or charts? <br />Are there any groups or charts that share similarities?<br />How can I break it into two parts?<br /><br />Map:<br />Is there more than one map being compared?<br />What are the time periods shown? (past, present, future) Are they in different maps or the same map?<br />What are the most noticeable differences between the multiple maps or time periods?<br />What parts of the map are the same in both maps/time periods?<br />Can the map(s) be easily broken into two parts? How?<br /><br />Process Diagrams:<br />Where is the start of the process? The end?<br />How many total stages are there?<br />What kind of process is it? Is it a cycle or a linear (start to finish) process?<br />What does each stage do? And what is its connection with the previous stage?<br />What is the end result? Is something produced?<br />Can the process be easily broken into two parts? How?<br /><br />Watch more IELTS Master Writing Task 1 videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQKm5R-SeKdOeIIbDm3k4-Bwt0PZNDdas">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQKm5R-SeKdOeIIbDm3k4-Bwt0PZNDdas</a><br /><br />Find more IELTS practice content: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ielts-master.com">http://www.ielts-master.com</a>{% endraw %}
