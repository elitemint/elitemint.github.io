{% raw %}There's an old saying: Good fences make for great neighbors.<br /><br />If you didn't have fences, there would be no boundaries, and your neighbors could come over whenever they wanted.<br /><br />You need to set up those similar types of fences in your organization.<br /><br />Setting up fences is healthy both at work and in your personal life.<br /><br />It allows you to protect your time and figure out the things you should be working on.<br /><br />One strategy for setting boundaries is to ponder and write down the answers to these questions:<br /><br />1. What are your goals?<br />2. What projects and tasks do you enjoy doing?<br />3. What projects or tasks really drain you?<br />4. What times during the day do you feel most productive?<br />5. What do you need to do during the day to feel most fulfilled?<br />6. What are your biggest distractions?  <br />7. What do you want your day to look like?<br /><br />#futureofwork #leadership #boundaries #distractions #productivity<br />----------------------------------------------<br /><br />Website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.thefutureorganization.com/">http://www.thefutureorganization.com/</a><br /><br />Twitter:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/jacobm">https://twitter.com/jacobm</a><br /><br />Facebook:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/FuturistJacob/">https://www.facebook.com/FuturistJacob/</a><br /><br />Newsletter<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thefutureorganization.com/newsletter">https://thefutureorganization.com/newsletter</a><br /><br />Amazon Book Page:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Jacob-Morgan/e/B00703V3WO/">https://www.amazon.com/Jacob-Morgan/e/B00703V3WO/</a><br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Jacob Morgan is a keynote speaker, best-selling author, and futurist.
