{% raw %}Although you’ve probably heard of different ways on how to increase bench press, the truth is that only a handful of these methods have actually been proven to work for a stronger bench press and are worth your time and effort. In this video, I’ll share with you what those methods are and how you can properly use them to increase bench press strength fast. I’ll also cover important bench press accessory lifts you need to know to get a stronger bench!<br /><br />The first and most crucial tip to a stronger bench press is simply to bench more frequently. Which is likely due to the superior skill acquisition and motor learning that you experience by benching more frequently. So, you can best do this by splitting up your weekly barbell bench press sets into multiple sessions. And you can also gradually increase your benching volume from where it’s at right now. And as for how many sets to aim for, build up for roughly 5-9 sets per week, and increase it further to 10-15 weekly sets if your body is still recovering well and you’d like to really focus on maximizing your bench press strength.<br /><br />Next, when it comes to how to increase bench press faster is to mix up your rep range with something called daily undulating periodization. Pick 3 different set/rep schemes for each day. One that focuses on hypertrophy by using moderate weight and a moderate rep range (3 sets of 8 reps, ~75% 1RM), one that focuses on power by using lighter weight and lower reps performed explosively off the chest (4 sets of 3 reps, ~70% 1RM), and then one that focuses on strength by using heavy weight and a lower rep range (5 sets of 3 reps, ~85% 1RM). Throw these into your bench days with the hypertrophy day (H) first, the power day (P) in the middle, and the strength day (S) last, since this specific “HPS” order leads to significantly greater strength gains when compared to other orders, since the power day in the middle allows for sufficient recovery between your more straining hypertrophy and strength days.<br /><br />The last thing is to add in the right bench press accessory lifts into your workouts. Choose exercises that help strengthen the specific weak points of your bench press. So if you seem to be the weakest and fail the most right off the chest, then you can perform the paused bench press. But if you tend to fail midway through your rep or during your lockout, the limiting factor is likely your lockout strength from your triceps. And a great accessory lift is the floor press. Some other great options as well include the close grip bench press as well as triceps extension movements such as dumbbell extensions or skull crushers for example. <br /><br />To apply all of this information into your routine to get a stronger bench press:<br /><br />Step 1: <br /><br />Instead of benching just 1x/week, increase your benching frequency to anywhere between 2-4 times per week depending on your schedule, as this can boost your strength gains by an additional 28% per extra bench day.<br /><br />Step 2:<br /><br />Gradually increase your volume from less than 5 sets of bench per week to roughly 10-15 sets of bench per week, as this can boost your strength gains by an additional 20%.<br /><br />Step 3:<br /><br />Mix up your rep ranges during each of your bench days by using the HPS protocol I previously went through, which has the potential to double the strength gains you experience.<br /><br />Step 4:<br /><br />Throw in the right accessory movements into your workouts based on where your weak points are in your bench press. This would likely provide another substantial boost (~10-20%) in your rate of strength gains.<br /><br />And when all of these steps are correctly applied, theoretically instead of gaining let’s say 10lbs on your bench press after a few months, you’d be able to potentially increase bench press strength by more than double that (+21.7lbs) given all of the little boosts each of these steps provide.<br /><br />And for a step-by-step program that builds these protocols and exercises into your weekly plan for you and shows how to properly progress them overtime such that you can break through plateaus and pack on size and strength in the most effective way possible then simply take the analysis quiz to discover which science-based program would be best for you and where your body is currently at below:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://builtwithscience.com/bws-free-fitness-quiz/gender?utm_source=Youtube&amp;utm_medium=Video&amp;utm_content=Description%20box&amp;utm_campaign=Stronger%20bench%20press%20Jan%2019%2F2020">https://builtwithscience.com/bws-free-fitness-quiz/gender?utm_source=Youtube&amp;utm_medium=Video&amp;utm_content=Description%20box&amp;utm_campaign=Stronger%20bench%20press%20Jan%2019%2F2020</a><br /><br />Filmed by: Bruno Martin Del Campo<br /><br />Video Clips From:<br />NFL Network, Pain and Gain, Avatar<br /><br />MUSIC:<br />soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired<br /><br />STUDIES:<br /><br />BENCH PRESS VOLUME<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28755103">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28755103</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28755103">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28755103</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28755103">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28755103</a><br /><br />REP RANGE<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11991778">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11991778</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19910831">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19910831</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21499134">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21499134</a><br /><br />HPS ORDER<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:183214/datastream/PDF/view">https://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:183214/datastream/PDF/view</a>{% endraw %}
