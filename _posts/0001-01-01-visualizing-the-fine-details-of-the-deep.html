{% raw %}For two decades, MBARI engineers have worked to develop deep-sea mapping capabilities to the point that it is now possible to map objects as small as one centimeter (0.4 inch) on the seafloor. Thanks to these major technological advances, MBARI has the ability to produce maps that—for the first time—bring together geology and biology. <br /><br />Using the new low-altitude survey system in 2018, MBARI surveyed Sur Ridge at one-centimeter resolution with sonar, lidar, and stereo photography. Sur Ridge is a steep, biologically-rich seamount offshore of the coast of Central California. MBARI also mapped hydrothermal vents offshore of Mexico, and a methane gas seep and an active fault as part of a study of potential geological hazards offshore of Southern California.<br /><br />For more information, see the MBARI 2018 Annual Report: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://annualreport.mbari.org/2018/ocean-imaging">http://annualreport.mbari.org/2018/ocean-imaging</a><br /><br />Video producer: Nancy Barr<br />Video editor: Kyra Schlining<br />Interview videographer: Todd Walsh<br />Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://taketones.com/track/digital-love">http://taketones.com/track/digital-love</a> (License N: TT000270144){% endraw %}
