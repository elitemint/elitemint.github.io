{% raw %}Aaron Rodgers knows a thing or two about staying healthy. Since taking over as Green Bay's starting quarterback in 2008, Rodgers rarely misses games. There's a reason for that, and Rodgers happily shared that secret with Cincinnati Bengals QB Joe Burrow following their Week 5 matchup. <br /><br />Rodgers' advice: When you take off and run, make sure you slide! <br /><br />Rodgers shared that tidbit on &quot;The Pat McAfee Show&quot; on Tuesday.<br /><br />Rodgers' full comment read:<br /><br />&quot;I'm a Joe Burrow fan. I enjoy the way he goes about his business. I enjoy the way he plays with confidence. I will tell you the thing that I told him, which I have told other quarterbacks from time to time. Slide! Slide! I said, 'You're too damn talented. You've got so much in front of you to accomplish in this league.' Just, sometimes, you gotta slide.&quot;<br /><br />Rodgers said he would share that advice with pretty much every quarterback, though he considers Lamar Jackson an exception to that rule. As Rodgers explained: &quot;He's so damn fast and talented and strong running the ball, man. If he can keep running like that for a lot of years, Lamar, you don't need to slide.&quot;<br /><br />Joe Burrow went to hospital after big hit<br />Burrow should probably listen to Rodgers' advice. Following the Bengals' 25-22 overtime loss to the Packers, Burrow went to the hospital with a throat contusion. He remained in the hospital overnight and was released Monday. <br /><br />Burrow took at least one massive hit during the contest. It came on a scramble in which Burrow refused to slide.<br /><br />It's unclear if Burrow hurt his throat on that play, though it's still probably smart for him to take better care of his body. <br /><br />In his second season, Burrow, 24, has taken a big step forward. He has completed 71.7 percent of his passes, and thrown 11 touchdowns against six interceptions. <br /><br />That performance has Bengals fans dreaming of Burrow eventually leading the team to multiple playoff appearances and a Super Bowl title. It's possible Burrow can deliver that, but he needs to stay healthy in order to hit that ceiling.{% endraw %}
