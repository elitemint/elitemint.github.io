{% raw %}Comfort Food and Cozy Vibes | Wholesome English Cottage Life | England in Autumn | Silent Vlog<br /><br />#silentvlog #cozyvibes #cottagecore #slowliving #wholesomevideo<br /><br />This simple living video is a cosy treat! With beautiful autumn scenery, comfort food from my cosy cottage kitchen and heating up by the cottage fireside. Bliss! <br /><br />Living in an English village, the surrounding countryside is stunning at this time of year. It's my favorite time for crisp morning walks and taking in the beautiful village surroundings. It's great to clear your mind and perfect for getting the fresh air we all need! <br /><br />I've also included my favourite easy cheesy snack - yummy English comfort food - Yorkshire Rarebit - adapted from my grandmother's recipe. I hope you enjoy this silent cooking video and get your dose of wholesome Yorkshire life! <br /><br />Yorkshire Rarebit Recipe: <br />50g butter<br />3 tbsp flour<br />Stout or strong ale (and some for a quick drink)<br />About 200g Cheddar cheese<br />1 tsp English mustard<br />Henderson's Relish (I like to use lots)<br />Slices of rustic bread (I used Sourdough for extra crunch)<br />Serve with a nice hot cup of tea! <br /><br />#englishlifestyle #villagecooking #villagelife<br />.........<br /><br />Please like and subscribe - it really helps my channel. <br /><br />Music I use: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/g7kw4y/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/g7kw4y/</a><br /><br />Letâ€™s connect on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2KqSPBT">http://bit.ly/2KqSPBT</a> <br /><br />Check out my lovely pins on Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/385U4j9">http://bit.ly/385U4j9</a><br /><br />I'm also on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/3oaDjJg">http://bit.ly/3oaDjJg</a><br /><br />You can support me for the price of a coffee on Ko-fi - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/apronfulfulofstones">https://ko-fi.com/apronfulfulofstones</a>{% endraw %}
