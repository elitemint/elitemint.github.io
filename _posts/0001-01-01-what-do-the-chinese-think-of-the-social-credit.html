{% raw %}When it comes to China, one of the popular topics that always seem to pop up for discussion in the West is the so-called social credit system. It's often being compared to an episode from the Netflix show “Black Mirror” where the central government keeps track of their citizens' every move. The question is, how do ordinary Chinese citizens feel about the social credit system? Do they even have the same understanding of it as it’s being viewed in the West? To find out, our Asian Boss reporter hit the streets of Shanghai. <br /><br />The opinions expressed in this video are those of individual interviewees alone and do not reflect the views of ASIAN BOSS or the general Chinese population.<br /><br />Follow us on social media:<br />Instagram ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/asianbossmedia/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/asianbossmedia/?hl=en</a><br />Facebook ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/asianboss">https://www.facebook.com/asianboss</a><br />Twitter ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/asianbossmedia?lang=en">https://twitter.com/asianbossmedia?lang=en</a><br />TikTok ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@asianbossmedia?lang=en">https://www.tiktok.com/@asianbossmedia?lang=en</a>{% endraw %}
