{% raw %}► SPONSOR THIS VIDEO: footballdailyuk@gmail.com<br /><br />Joe's back on your screens again, this time it's all about the return of one man - Steven Gerrard.<br /><br />Stevie G's just been hired by Aston Villa after they sacked Dean Smith, with the scouser leaving Rangers after breaking Celtic's title winning streak. He has a big job on his hands with a more than capable squad, but Joe takes a look at what players he should sign from each Premier League club either in January or the summer!<br /><br />(Obviously not buy them all, that would be a bit mad)<br /><br />Remember to like the video and subscribe to FD!! <br /><br />► SUBSCRIBE to FOOTBALL DAILY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/fdsubscribe">http://bit.ly/fdsubscribe</a><br /><br />► SUBSCRIBE to EURO FOOTBALL DAILY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/37igEnb">https://bit.ly/37igEnb</a><br /><br />► SUBSCRIBE to FOOTBALL DAILY PODCASTS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3moyeMO">https://bit.ly/3moyeMO</a><br /><br />► JOIN THE FAN RUN FD FAMILY DISCORD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/KH5YMxA">https://discord.gg/KH5YMxA</a><br /><br />► SIGN UP FOR A FREE SMARTERSCOUT MEMBERSHIP HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://smarterscout.com/">https://smarterscout.com/</a><br /><br />This is Football Daily - the home of Premier League fan analysis on YouTube.
