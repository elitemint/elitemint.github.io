{% raw %}Possibly the greatest calypso ever made... Thanks to Winsford &quot;Joker&quot; Devine for the excellent composition....<br />This song is just as relevant now as it was then and we as a people should heed its message before it is too late....<br />Enjoy brothers and sisters....<br /><br />&quot;Today as I look around in the<br />world what do I see?<br />I see.<br />Footprints that man has left<br />On the sand<br />While walking through time.<br />I see,<br />Fruits of our ambitions<br />Figments of our imaginations<br />And I ask myself<br />When will it end<br />When will it end<br />It is plain to see<br />Universally,<br />This land is not bountiful as it was<br />Simply because<br />In his quest for success<br />Nothing stands in man's way<br />Old rivers run dry<br />Soon the birds won't fly<br />The mountains will be no longer high<br />And I wonder why?<br /><br />I see<br />Charity deplored<br />Equal rights<br />Totally ignored<br />Wisdom and ingenuity<br />working in accord<br />Simply to afford such inventions<br />As thermonuclear warfare<br />And environmental warfare<br />And I wonder now<br />Where do we go from here<br /><br />Prophets everywhere<br />Gaze upon the horizons<br />And declare that judgment will come<br />As the savage hands of<br />unscrupulous men<br />Defile everything passing by<br />Time is running out<br />As we eat and drink<br />Species on the brink<br />Of being extinct<br />And I think<br />No one can deny<br />The price of progress is high<br /><br />I see consciousness abate<br />As today,<br />We live recklessly<br />Money<br />Makes egos inflate<br />And, thereby, creates,<br />A turbulent state.<br /><br />I see a struggle<br />Between the sexes<br />New hang-ups and old complexes<br />Now the question is<br />Right in context<br />What shall be next?<br /><br />I have already seen<br />The world has become divided<br />Between race, colour, creed and class<br />And some of the things<br />The scriptures predict<br />Truthfully come to pass<br />Soil that wouldn't bear<br />Children making children<br />To be part of this growing mass<br />And I ask<br />If this is progress<br />How long will it last?&quot;{% endraw %}
