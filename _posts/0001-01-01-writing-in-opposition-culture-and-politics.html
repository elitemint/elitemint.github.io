{% raw %}Day #4 in our series 'Debates on Europe: Budapest &amp; Beyond. Defending Intellectual Freedom', 4–7 May 2021<br /><br />Closing Talk<br />A conversation on literature and politics<br /><br />Hungarian culture is in the middle of a major upheaval. A new law on cultural policy emphasises the aim to preserve national culture and strengthen national identity. Via a Culture Council the state gets influence over both the organization and content of cultural institutions. How does this affect writers, artists, and other cultural workers? In the UK, populist nationalism has divided society over Brexit and nostalgia for an imagined past is charting the country’s course for the future. How free is literature in a politicised society – in Hungary and in other parts of Europe?<br /><br />Speakers: A. L. Kennedy (writer, Scotland) and Zsófia Bán (writer, Hungary)<br />Moderator: Rosie Goldsmith (director of the European Literature Network, UK)<br /><br />debates-on-europe.eu/budapest-and-beyond{% endraw %}
