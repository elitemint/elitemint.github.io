{% raw %}You missed THIS in The Shawshank Redemption. After Andy Dufresne has escaped from prison, the head of the prison guards who tormented him for many years is finally arrested. When Guard Captain Hadley is read his Miranda Rights by the District Attorney, he’s shown reading them off of a piece of paper. The reason the DA still doesn’t have them memorized is because the court case requiring those rights to be explicitly stated, Miranda v Arizona, had just occurred in the same year the scene takes place - 1966.{% endraw %}
