They will fucking dangle you, the kangas. They'll make it look like a suicide.&quot;<br />___<br />Watched this movie last week (because Jack O' Connell) and I have to say it's worth your time. It can be emotionally exhausting; it was for me. But, if drama is your favorite genre, you'll love it. Jack's character, Eric Love, is 19-years old and was transferred to adult prison prematurely. He also happens to meet his father there. They develop a volatile relationship, and while a dehumanized Eric fights for his life behind the bars between gang politics and corruption, he's unsure if his father is there to protect him or punish him. <br />___<br />Movie: Starred Up <br />Song: So Strong (feat.
