{% raw %}There's a helpful concept we use to help understand what distance from a given star you might expect to find planets with liquid water on their surface â€“ liquid water being essential for life as we know it. It's called the habitable zone. Every star has a habitable zone, but where that zone lies is different for stars of different sizes and brightness. <br /><br />Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech{% endraw %}
