Some are scary and mean looking, and others are gentle and cute looking. Sometimes those scary ones can be big ol softies, and then sometimes those cuties could actually want to rip our throats out. Animals are just diverse honestly, and they also come in all sizes. While some are expected to be small, there are some species that are considered to be larger than normal, exceeding their species normal size range and looking generally scary as hell.<br />And its those giants among tinies that were gonna focus on today! From a spider that’ll give you arachnophobia to the biggest good boi around, here are ten abnormally large animals. <br /><br />With all that said and done, lets begin shall we?<br /><br /><br />#10: The Goliath BirdEater.<br /><br />Hold that thought I’m gonna be right back…<br /><br />(Walks away, Screams, Comes back.)<br /><br />Aight, got that out of my system. So yeah, big frigging spider, need I say more? Well for my quotas sake, yes, yes I must.  The Goliath Birdeater is certainly a scary sight to see, since generally spiders are much much smaller than this, being lucky to be as big as the tip of your finger. This one is bigger than your entire hand. <br />This giant spider dwells primarily in the Amazon jungles, and belongs to the tarantula family. These big and very bad boys can grow up to be up to 12 inches long from leg tip to leg tip, and can weigh a rather terrifying 6.2 ounces….Okay, terrifying for a spider at least.<br />Now I know this guys name is frigging horrifying for anyone, no matter if you have context or not, but let me explain its diet. Goliaths generally feed on arthorpods, worms, and a multitude of amphibians. While they do have the birdeater in their name, its actually quite rare for them to go after birds, both for dietary reasons and opportunity. <br />Still though...Terrifying. <br /><br /><br />#9: The African Giant Snail.<br /><br />You ever see that movie King Kong? You know, the movie about the giant ape? Sure hes memorable, but on top of the giant ape, EVERYTHING was giant. The bugs, the crabs, the birds, even the snails!! And this not so little guy here looks like he came right from that dang movie!<br />While he isn’t from a movie, hes still a biggin, and this guy goes by the apt name of the African Giant Snail. This behemoth among mollusks can grow as long as 8 inches and cover your hand better than the spider. Despite the name, its actually found in quite a few locations outside of Africa, and its considered a pest despite its impressive size. The reason for this is their big appetite, attacking crops and also reproducing at a rapid rate. While they may be considered a pest, cant argue that theyre still impressive...If not a little gross to look at. <br /><br />#8: The Chinese Giant Salamander <br /><br />When we think of Salamanders we often think of tiny little lizards, scampering about on the ground and eating bugs. Or We think of Charmander. More than likely Charmander. And to be fair, this big guy looks a lot like his pokemon counterpart, both in color and size. <br />This is the Chinese Giant Salamander, a giant lizard known for being about 66 pounds on the reg and growing to an impressive 3.8 ft in length. This guy is the biggest Salamander in the world, and while he isn’t the biggest lizard in the world, hes certainly up there. Chinese salamanders generally feed on insects, worms, millipedes, and smaller amphibians like frogs and other salamanders. They also have interesting vocalizations, which include the standard hissing, but they can also make bark like noises and cry. It’s been said that these noises can actually sound similar to human children, making this one a little unnerving, especially if youre the cleaner whose alone at night <br /><br /><br />#7: Hercules the Giant Liger.<br /><br />Moving on now to less widespread species and more a single individual, meet Hercules the Liger. Ligers are a chimera, a meeting of two similar yet different species, the lion and tiger. Hercules is the result of a male lion, and a female tiger, and this result is one big kitty. Hercules was bred in captivity, and as of this writing measures 11 feet tal on his hind legs, and weighing a very very heavy 922 pounds. Hes a very sociabable guy, loving the interactions he has with his trainers and what other animals he interacts with. You wont find ligers in the wild and are bred exclusively in human captivity. They have a sister species, called the tigon. However, ligers are the larger of the the two by a very large margin.{% endraw %}
