{% raw %}Welcoming hundreds of thousands of spectators from around the world, the Ras Al Khaimah New Year‚Äôs Eve Celebrations (RAKNYE 2022) dazzled all with a spectacular fireworks display that smashed two Guinness World Records.<br /><br />The world records were for ‚ÄòMost Remote Operated Multirotors/Drones Launching Fireworks Simultaneously‚Äô and secondly the ‚ÄòHighest Altitude Multirotor/Drone Firework Display.‚Äô<br /><br />Spanning 4.7 kilometers and rising majestically from the Arabian Gulf, the 12-minute pyrotechnic drone and fireworks performance included 15,000 fireworks effects, over 130 sea pontoons and a fleet of hundreds of pyrotechnic drones.<br /><br />The 12-minute spectacle was specially choreographed to reflect the joy of reunion with six themes set to epic orchestral music. The symphony of lights and music provided the visitors, several of whom had been camping at designated spots with family and friends from the day before, one of the most enriching festive experiences.<br /><br />Ushering in the New Year with a heightened spirit of positivity and optimism, the fireworks show was also a tribute to the UAE as it marks its 50th year of formation and an ode to Ras Al Khaimah‚Äôs growing stature as one of the region‚Äôs leading tourism destinations.<br /><br />RAKNYE 2020 fireworks display was conducted in a six-act sequence starting with the countdown just before midnight setting the stage for an ephemeral theatre of wonder. Ushering in the New Year with a spectacular tower of lights at a height of 1,055.8 meters (over 1 km) taller than any building in the world. This was followed by the ‚ÄòHappy New Year‚Äô message written in the sky with firework drones, the sequence lit up the arena in multiple hues. These two sequences broke two new Guinness World Records for Ras Al Khaimah.<br /><br />The next sequence was a tribute to the UAE backed by orchestral music, celebrating the achievements of the nation and its people.<br /><br />The elegantly designed fireworks segued to the next act when hundreds of drones displayed the UAE‚Äôs 50th Anniversary logo with a brilliant display. What followed was another stunning show that defined the UAE‚Äôs ambition for the next 50 years.<br /><br />The grand finale was in two parts ‚Äì one a multi-color display of lights followed by a super-massive expanse of white that illuminated the skyline of Ras Al Khaimah with the message of hope and ambition.<br /><br />‚òÄÔ∏è Relevant hashtags:<br />#raknye2022 #rasalkhaimah #newyearfireworks #rasalkhaimahtourism #raktourism #almarjanisland{% endraw %}
