{% raw %}Keynote speech - Taiwan Extensive Reading Association, Feng Chia Univerity, Taiwan, 22 May 2021.<br /><br />In my presentation, I first begin by explaining briefly the theory behind extensive reading (ER) and extensive listening (EL), and then provide research evidence that shows the language learning benefits of ER and EL. The rest of the presentation encourages teachers to consider integrating ER and EL in their teaching.<br /><br />My presentation slides can be viewed or downloaded here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://willyrenandya.com/the-primacy-of-extensive-reading-and-listening-3/">https://willyrenandya.com/the-primacy-of-extensive-reading-and-listening-3/</a> <br /><br />For more resources on ER and EL: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.willyrenandya/blog;">https://www.willyrenandya/blog;</a> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://erfoundation.org/wordpress/">https://erfoundation.org/wordpress/</a>{% endraw %}
