{% raw %}A little sisterly advice: see &quot;This is Called Helping&quot; clip and watch #Encanto in theaters now! 🌸<br /><br />Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Encanto,” is the tale of an extraordinary family, the Madrigals, who live hidden in the mountains of Colombia in a magical house, in a vibrant town, in a wondrous, charmed place called an Encanto. The all-new original film features the voice of Stephanie Beatriz as Mirabel, an ordinary 15-year-old who’s struggling to find her place in her family. “Mirabel is a really funny, loving character who also deeply yearns for something more,” says Beatriz. “She’s also not afraid to stand up for what she knows is right—something I love and relate to very much.”<br /><br />Instagram: @movie<br />Twitter: @movie<br />Facebook: @Movie<br /><br />Hashtag: #Encanto{% endraw %}
