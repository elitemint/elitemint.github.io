{% raw %}Ever feel like giving up photography?  Do setbacks set you down permanently?  Join Jason Lanier for a video where he perseveres through a setback to create some breathtaking work as he exemplifies the definition of never giving up.<br /><br />This shoot was conducted in Belle Glades, Florida on the side of a road in a sugar cane field.  This was an unplanned shoot that had to be created on the fly due to Jason and his team getting thrown out of their original shoot location.<br /><br />In this video Jason uses the Rotolight Titan X1 in flash mode with the Elinchrom Skyport Transmitter to create some movie like imagery with the models named Maddi and Nicole.  This was shot using the Sony A9 with the 35mm Sony Zeiss lens.<br /><br />**Links to Gear**<br /><br />-Rotolight Titan X1-  for the best deals on all Rotolight products please visit:  www.rotolight.com/jasonoffers<br /><br />-Sony A9-  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bhpho.to/35PyHQX">https://bhpho.to/35PyHQX</a><br /><br />Sony Zeiss 35mm-  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bhpho.to/31XPakZ">https://bhpho.to/31XPakZ</a><br /><br />**Links to Social Media**<br /><br />Photographer: Jason Lanier<br /><br />*Website- www.jasonlanier.com<br />*Podcast- www.jasonlanier.com/podcast<br />*Instagram- www.instagram.com/jasonlanierphotography<br />*Facebook- www.facebook.com/groups/jasonlanierworkshops<br />*Twitter- www.twitter.com/jlanierphoto<br /><br />Models: Madison Ella and Nicole Taylor<br /><br />*Instagram: <br /><br />www.instagram.com/madisoneellaa<br /><br />www.instagram.com/nicole.tayylor<br /><br />Crew: Anthony Schick, Gato Delix, Greg McCoy<br /><br />www.instagram.com/anthonyschickphotography<br /><br />www.instagram.com/gatodelix<br /><br />www.instagram.com/gregselfaction<br /><br />We thank you for watching and invite you to watch a few more videos while you're here.
