{% raw %}How Icebox in Valorant is meant to be played...with shotguns. Good ol' reliable, playing shotgun sage on Icebox gets you a win in Valorant and some nice RR gain. I did some more voice-overs to explain my thought process, points out mistakes, or talk about how I played. Hope you guys enjoy!<br /><br />We do a little bit of trolling at the end.<br /><br />Songs: <br />Gamma Ray Sky - La Boucle<br />Sunny Stockholm - La Boucle<br />Too Slow of a Drive - Arc De Soleil<br /><br /><br />#Valorant #ShotgunSage #shotgunonly #valoranthighlights #valorantmontage #valorantgameplay #valorantcringe #cringe{% endraw %}
