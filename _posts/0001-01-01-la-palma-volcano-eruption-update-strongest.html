{% raw %}The La Palma / Cumbre Vieja eruption is now in its 40th day. After several hours of rapid uplift, the most intense period yet in the eruption occurred. Towering fountains of lava traveled to more than 600 meters or 2,000 feet in height, and created new rivers of lava. So far, more than 9 square kilometers have been covered with lava, and 40 hectares of new land have been added to the island. On October 23rd, the largest earthquake during the overall eruption occurred, rating as a 4.9 on the richter scale. It represented the largest earthquake to ever occur on the island. This video will discuss what is likely to happen next as this Spanish Canary Island volcano. <br /><br />Social media link(s) of a scientific organization which can provide more up to date information:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.involcan.org/">http://www.involcan.org/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/INVOLCAN">https://www.facebook.com/INVOLCAN</a>  <br /><br />Special Thanks to: TV Canarias <br /><br />If you would like to support this channel, consider becoming a patron at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/geologyhub.">http://patreon.com/geologyhub.</a><br /><br />Another way to support this channel is to make an order via our gemstone and geology related etsy store at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://prospectingarizona.etsy.com.">http://prospectingarizona.etsy.com.</a>{% endraw %}
