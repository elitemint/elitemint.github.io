{% raw %}10 Dangerous Animals You Should Run Away From<br /><br />The world is filled with millions of species of animals. Some of them are quite harmless, quietly living<br />their lives, while some of them are just downright dangerous. Today we will be looking at 10 of the most<br />dangerous animals that you should run away from. Make sure you stay tuned, and stay away from<br />number one. The number of fatalities these animals cause is simply staggering.<br /><br />Number 10. Sharks<br />We’re not talking about an individual species of shark; we are lumping the entire family in as a whole.<br />Movies and media are often spreading the picture of sharks being ferocious killers that eat and destroy<br />everything that comes in their way, but it’s quite exaggerated and many shark species are harmless to<br />humans.<br />Each year, there are around 75 shark attacks, whereas most arise from a misunderstanding that a surfer<br />looks similar to seals. However, only 10 out of these attacks result in the death of the victim.<br />With that said, of course, sharks, especially the Great White and Bull sharks are incredibly powerful<br />predators that should always be respected, but they don’t really see humans as food. So, if you’re<br />scared of sharks, don’t think of them as the monsters killing thousands of people each year because that<br />is not true.<br /><br />Number 9. Ants<br />It’s quite counter intuitive to think that ants are more dangerous animals than sharks. But the fact is that<br />they are. While sharks cause the average if 10 fatalities yearly, triple that number for ants. 30 casualties<br />every year are attributed to ant attacks.<br />One particular species to take note of is the bulldog ant. This red, angry-looking variety of ant is one of<br />the largest and most aggressive species of ants on the planet. They have large mandibles and venomous<br />stings that, in humans, causes intense pain, the worst of any insect sting, that can last for several days.<br />They are so aggressive that whenever this ant is cut in half, the head and the tail will actually fight and<br />try to kill each other.<br />Another one worth mentioning is the bullet ant. They are is known to have one of the most painful<br />stings. It is found in South America and is also known as the 24-hour ant because of the pain you feel for<br />up to 24 hours after being stung. Some victims even describe being stung by this ant as painful as being<br />shot with a bullet.<br /><br />Number 8. Bees and Wasps<br />In truth, bees and wasps should have landed higher in our list of the most dangerous animals in the<br />world. The problem is, nobody in the world is actively keeping track of fatalities attributed to them. In<br />the US alone, 50 people per year succumb to bee and wasp attacks. For all we know, that number could<br />balloon to 500 if we include worldwide attacks.<br /><br />Case in point is the Japanese Giant Hornet. Every year up to 40 deaths are recorded by the sting of<br />Japanese hornet. The venom of Japanese Hornet would cause an allergic reaction and dissolve tissues<br />within the short time. The repeated stinging from the group of Hornets could also result in death.<br />Japanese hornets are very aggressive and fearless. One hornet alone is more than capable of dispatching<br />40 individual bees all by its lonesome, but these guys rarely operate alone. Each colony of Japanese<br />Hornet contains up to 700 members. They feed on honey bee larvae to a significant amount.<br /><br />Number 7. Deer<br />You wouldn’t think it, but deer are actually quite dangerous creatures. In fact, the yearly worldwide<br />average of deer related fatalities is at least 300 people. But how come these normally docile creatures<br />be the cause of so many deaths?<br />Well, deer have horns and you might think that these would be the main cause of human fatalities. But<br />that’s very wrong. Yes, admittedly, there have been recorded cases of fatal deer horn impalement but<br />that’s very rare and far in between. The latest one being a man in Arkansas who was gored to death by a<br />deer he shot and thought was already dead only in October of this year.<br />With that said, the vast majority of deer related fatalities happen when deer cross the road, usually at<br />dusk or at dawn. Couple that with a sleepy driver then we have a definite recipe for disaster. In the US<br />alone, over 150 cases are reported each year of people running over deer on the highway, with very<br />tragic results.<br /><br />If you're new, Subscribe! → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/djmfuX">http://goo.gl/djmfuX</a><br /><br />Top 5 Best is the #1 place for all your heart warming stories about amazing people that will inspire you everyday.
