{% raw %}I'm blazing new trails on the property! It's a project that will take a few summers to complete but now that I have the Kubota B2601 Compact Tractor, a chainsaw and time, it's time to get things underway up here at the cottage. This is Part 1 in the series. A very important part! Confirming property lines and boundaries. Hope you'll join me today. Cheers!<br />A special thanks to Greg Bishop Surveying! www.gregbishopsurveying.com<br />#trail #landsurvey #trailbuilding{% endraw %}
