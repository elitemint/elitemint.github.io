{% raw %}One little boy is always wondering with incredible results!This is a story about a boy whose head is always full of wonder. Most people call him 'The Daydreamer'. We follow him on an average-seeming school day, where his daydreams transform the world around him. Unfortunately lots of other people the park keeper, the bus driver, the lollipop lady all tell him to get his head out of the clouds. It is only in art class that he realises he can bring the wonder out of his head for the whole world to enjoy.<br /><br /><br />Enjoy!
