{% raw %}Though BTS couldn't be at Hitmakers in person, the Grammy-nominated K-pop group sent over an earnest video speech thanking Variety for awarding &quot;Butter&quot; record of the year. “'Butter’ holds a very special place in our heart,&quot; RM said during their acceptance speech. &quot;During these uncertain and turbulent times with the pandemic, we took time to look back on our past and present and decided to release ‘Butter’ in hopes of lifting spirits. The song became an anchor for us to enjoy what we can now and keep moving forward. We just finished our first in-person concert we longed for in two years, especially since the pandemic and this feels truly like the beginning of our new chapter.”<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/VarietySubscribe">http://bit.ly/VarietySubscribe</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/variety">http://www.facebook.com/variety</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/variety">http://www.instagram.com/variety</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/variety">http://www.twitter.com/variety</a>{% endraw %}
