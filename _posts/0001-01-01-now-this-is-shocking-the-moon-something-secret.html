{% raw %}MUST WATCH THIS - Something Secret Is Happening On The Moon! NOW THIS Is Shocking!..<br /><br />The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. At about one-quarter the diameter of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia), it is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System overall, and is larger than any known dwarf planet. The Moon is a planetary-mass object that formed a differentiated rocky body, making it a satellite planet under geophysical definitions of the term. It lacks any significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's Jupiter's moon Io is the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density.<br /><br />A moonbase is a facility on the surface of the Moon, enabling human activity at the Moon. As such it is different from a lunar space station in orbit around the Moon, like the planned Lunar Gateway of the Artemis program. Moonbases can be for uncrewed or crewed use, in both cases not necessarily including lunar habitation facilities. A base might be a step towards colonization.<br /><br />Missions to the Moon have so far realized only temporary single-mission bases (Tranquility Base being the first), as well as some small permanent installations. Though plans for establishing facilities on the Moon that could enable sustained human activity at the Moon, have been proposed and are actively pursued nationally and increasingly internationally by space agencies.<br /><br />The Hollow Moon hypothesis, or Spaceship Moon hypothesis, proposes that Earth's Moon is either wholly hollow or otherwise contains a substantial interior space. No scientific evidence exists to support the idea; seismic observations and other data collected since spacecraft began to orbit or land on the Moon indicate that it has a thin crust, extensive mantle and small, dense core, although overall it is much less dense than Earth.<br /><br />Extraterrestrial life is hypothetical life that may occur outside Earth and which did not originate on Earth. Such life might range from simple prokaryotes (or comparable life forms) to intelligent beings and even sapient beings, possibly bringing forth civilizations that might be far more advanced than humanity. The Drake equation speculates about the existence of sapient life elsewhere in the universe. The science of extraterrestrial life in all its forms is known as astrobiology.<br /><br />This is, &quot;NOW THIS Is Shocking!..&quot; The Moon Something Secret Is Going On<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE @Anonymous Official  for more<br /><br />Follow us<br />YouTube <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/anonymous">https://youtube.com/anonymous</a><br />Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/anonymous">https://instagram.com/anonymous</a><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/anonymousofcl">https://twitter.com/anonymousofcl</a><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/anonymousdirect">https://www.facebook.com/anonymousdirect</a><br /><br />Content licensed in part by Zohar Entertainment Group.<br /><br />MOTIVATIONAL<br />MOTIVATIONAL EDUCATION<br />MOTIVATIONAL VIDEO<br />MOTIVATIONAL RECOMMENDED<br /><br />2021 truth message full video new video today this week this month this year education motivational follow recommended motivation educational aliens ufo documentary universe earth{% endraw %}
