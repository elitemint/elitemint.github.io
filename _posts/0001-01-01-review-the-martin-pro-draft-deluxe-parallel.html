{% raw %}Many of you have asked how I like the Daler-Rowney Art Sphere Desktop Easel, and because it is so small, I wound up switching to this, the Martin Pro Draft Deluxe Parallel Straightedge Drawing Board.<br />This drawing board is EVERYTHING to me in the studio now, after a year and a half using it. While I wish it was a little less clunky, it is a solid workhorse that really makes drawing easier and less painful for me. If you're looking to solve your back pain or neck pain in the studio, do not hesitate to add this to your tools. It is worth every penny. AND I AM NOT SPONSORED BY THIS COMPANY- I just use it daily and love it. Holler if you have any questions about it, I'm happy to share my experience with it.<br /><br />Here is the link to buy it from Martin on Amazon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3Jk1zUi">https://amzn.to/3Jk1zUi</a><br />There are also smaller sizes available.<br /><br />Thanks for watching, liking, subscribing &amp; commenting!
