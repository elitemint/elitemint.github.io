{% raw %}We invited My Little Homestead back out to see the finished shed and enjoy a meal together. We absolutely adore this family and are so happy to have met them. They are a wealth of knowledge on earthbag building, roofs, family togetherness, and so much more. Make sure you're subscribed to their channel to keep up with their family adventures. <br /><br />In today's video we also lay more bags, create some frames for the chicken run and chicken coop, and explain why we are starting on the exterior circle! Let's do this!<br /><br />LINKS//<br /><br />HYPERADOBE BAGS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyshinyhome.com/hyperadobebag">https://tinyshinyhome.com/hyperadobebag</a><br />WEBSITE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyshinyhome.com">https://tinyshinyhome.com</a><br />30 DAY YOUTUBE CHALLENGE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyshinyhome.com/youtube30">https://tinyshinyhome.com/youtube30</a><br />NINE NINE : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.strongdoodles.com">http://www.strongdoodles.com</a><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tinyshinyhome">https://www.instagram.com/tinyshinyhome</a><br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/tinyshinyhome">https://facebook.com/tinyshinyhome</a><br />COURSES: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyshinyhome.com/products">https://tinyshinyhome.com/products</a><br />AIRSTREAM RENOVATION: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyshinyhome.com/airstream">https://tinyshinyhome.com/airstream</a><br />SUPPORT US BY SHOPPING ON AMAZON: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyshinyhome.com/amazonaffiliate">https://tinyshinyhome.com/amazonaffiliate</a> <br />MUSIC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://artlist.io">https://artlist.io</a><br /><br />#hyperadobe #earthbag #chickengarden{% endraw %}
