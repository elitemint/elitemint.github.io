{% raw %}&quot;Mad Money&quot; host Jim Cramer on Tuesday cheered General Electric's decision to split up its aviation, health care and power businesses into three separate companies.

However, at this point, Cramer said it no longer made sense to keep the remaining units together.<br /><br />“Let me put it like this: if you were starting a company today, you’d never create one that’s part aerospace, part health care, and part power, including renewables,” Cramer said.<br /><br />GE aims to spin off its health-care arm by early 2023 and its energy unit by early 2024, according to a company press release. The current GE will be the company focused on aviation.<br /><br />Once this happens, Cramer said the standalone companies will be easier for Wall Street analysts and investors alike to get behind.<br /><br />“Even at their peak, this combination hasn’t been able to excite anyone for twenty years, hence why you had to do this,” the former hedge fund manager said, but he suggested it may be a different story as separate entities.<br /><br />“A health-care company based on high-demand MRI machines that they can’t even get enough of? That’s a good one,” Cramer said. “The power and renewables business could be very enticing for money managers who want to go green — and there’s a lot of them out there.”<br /><br />Shares of GE rose 2.65% Tuesday to close at $111.29 apiece. The stock is up nearly 29% year to date, outpacing the S&amp;P 500′s roughly 25% gain over the same span.<br /><br />» Subscribe to CNBC TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic</a> <br /><br />Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.
