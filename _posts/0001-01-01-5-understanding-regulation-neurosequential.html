{% raw %}This brief video (20 min) reviews some of the basics of 'regulation' and helps viewers understand why patterned, repetitive somatosensory activity is regulating.  The primary regulatory role of dissociation is also discussed.  Very basic neuroscience about stress and regulation can help viewers understand the power of intentional regulatory practices - especially in the current COVID-19 pandemic.{% endraw %}
