{% raw %}As 285 million people live in a situation of visual-impairment throughout the world, we believe very much can be done so that they can be independent, lead their lives and make their choices as any one else regardless their age or their fragility. <br /><br />One way to empower them is to make sure they make the most of the &quot;windows to the world&quot; that the computer means today.  We have designed a computer usable whatever their sight or their age and a custom-tailored training and assistance so that they are not left alone in the learning curve.<br /><br />With 300+ users in France, the proof of concept is over and the product,, available in 24 different languages, is ready for internationalization.{% endraw %}
