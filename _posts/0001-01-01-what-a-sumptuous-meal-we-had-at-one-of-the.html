{% raw %}I like sampling different types of food whenever l go to an eatery, but l must confess l am obsessed with the  Sizzler chicken and Stir fry served at Sultan Restaurant in Hargeisa Somaliland. <br /><br />Their recipe is spot on - mouthwatering,to say the least. We truly enjoyed our dinner during our wedding anniversary ♥️<br /><br />If you are in Hargeisa, Jigjigayar precisely, make sure you pop in Sultan Restaurant and enjoy their dishes…and great ambiance of course. <br /><br />………Note that this is not a paid promotion, it’s solely my personal opinion based on the great services l have received at the Sultan establishment.{% endraw %}
