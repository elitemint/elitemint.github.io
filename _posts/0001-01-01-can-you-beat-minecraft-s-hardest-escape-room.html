{% raw %}With all of the escape rooms going around you might have found that they're a tad bit too easy. Well when I got the chance to take on the hardest escape room in Minecraft I knew I had to give it a shot. This is the hardest escape room ever. <br /><br /><br />And if you want to see me torture a few of my friends with this same escape room then check out @Twifies  where the video will release in a few days :)<br /><br />➤➤ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/WifiesWasTaken">https://twitter.com/WifiesWasTaken</a><br />➤➤ Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/zAWUuWb">https://discord.gg/zAWUuWb</a><br /><br /><br />➤➤Links:<br />Thank you to <br />@McYum @Sipover @rekrap2 @Boosfer and @Mysticat for participating in beating this room<br /><br />And thank you to @SeaWattgaming  for inspiring this video format<br /><br /><br />This is a series called Minecraft VVSauce where I explore random features of Minecraft.
