{% raw %}Giving Freely!<br />Matthew 10:1-15<br />Everything about being a disciple of Christ is about giving. “Discipleship giving” is made possible by faith in Christ and allowing His will and Holy Spirit to flow through us each day. Jesus called His disciples and gave them power (Matt 10:1) for the giving of miracles and service to others. We come together by giving by proclaiming the good news about the kingdom of heaven. Christ states, “Freely you have received freely give” (Matt 10:8). Disciple Principle:  Christ gave so that we as His cannels can give out to others, which He has made possible through the gift of empowerment of the Holy Spirit. Remember: Christ has given so we as His disciples can give freely to others (Rom 8:32, Rev 22:17). Today give the gift of Christ peace (Matt 10:13)!<br />Related Scriptures: Matt 10:1-15, Matt 10:1, Matt 10:8, Rom 8:32, Rev 22:17.<br /><br />Related Words: Jesus, power, Holy Spirit, freely, receive, provision, donate, bestow, deliver, give, gave, giving, Jesus Christ.<br />#givingfreely #givingwateroflifefreely   #jamespaulhumphries<br /><br />Dec 16, 2021.    #630{% endraw %}
