{% raw %}While on an electrical repair job for Oscorp, Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) suffers a terrible accident.<br />#Spiderman #AndrewGarfield #PeterParker #Electro #JamieFoxx<br /><br />Watch the full movie! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/The_Amazing_Spider_Man_2?id=Z8v8kW_jAI4.P">https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/The_Amazing_Spider_Man_2?id=Z8v8kW_jAI4.P</a><br /><br />It’s great to be Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield). For Peter Parker, there’s no feeling quite like swinging between skyscrapers, embracing being the hero, and spending time with Gwen (Emma Stone). But being Spider-Man comes at a price: only Spider-Man can protect his fellow New Yorkers from the formidable villains that threaten the city. With the emergence of Electro (Jamie Foxx), Peter must confront a foe far more powerful than himself. And as his old friend, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), returns, Peter comes to realize that all of his enemies have one thing in common: Oscorp.{% endraw %}
