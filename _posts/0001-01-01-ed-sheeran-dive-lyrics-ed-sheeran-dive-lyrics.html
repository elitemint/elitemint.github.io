(What's your history?)<br />Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?<br />'Cause I heard you do, mmm<br /><br />I could fall, or I could fly<br />Here in your aeroplane<br />And I could live, I could die<br />Hanging on the words you say<br />And I've been known to give my all<br />And lie awake, every day<br />Don't know how much I can take<br /><br />So don't call me baby<br />Unless you mean it<br />Don't tell me you need me<br />If you don't believe it<br />So let me know the truth<br />Before I dive right into you<br /><br />(Guitar Solo)<br /><br />I could fall, or I could fly<br />Here in your aeroplane<br />And I could live, I could die<br />Hanging on the words you say<br />And I've been known to give my all<br />Sitting back, looking at<br />Every mess that I made<br /><br />So don't call me baby<br />Unless you mean it<br />Don't tell me you need me<br />If you don't believe it<br />Let me know the truth<br />Before I dive right into you<br />Before I dive right into you<br />Before I dive right into you<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><br />I do not own the Cover, Song and Background Photo.
