{% raw %}Poland, Lithuania and Latvia are considering asking NATO for help with the crisis on their borders with Belarus. Thousands of migrants have arrived in Belarus in recent weeks, hoping to reach the European Union. The EU accuses Belarus of creating the crisis deliberately - and EU foreign ministers are to adopt new sanctions against Minsk. Meanwhile, migrants stuck on the Belarusian side of the border with Poland are suffering from a lack of food, water and shelter - as winter sets in.<br />A humanitarian catastrophe is growing on the border between Poland and Belarus, where migrants hoping to enter the EU have been stuck for weeks. <br />People have started to die as temperatures drop below zero. Still, neither side wants to let them in.<br />Out of desperation, the migrants have built makeshift shelters and lit fires to try and keep warm.<br />Volunteers have come in to provide food, warm clothing and basic medical assistance where they can. But it's not nearly enough, and many are scared for their survival. <br />Their presence has inflamed a bitter standoff between Belarus and Poland, with tensions on both sides escalating. Belarus is threatening to allow migrants through. And the west is threatening further sanctions against the Belarusian regime.<br />Unwanted on both sides and unable to leave, the migrants have no choice but to wait it out and pray that help arrives soon.<br /><br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />For more news go to: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.dw.com/en/">http://www.dw.com/en/</a><br />Follow DW on social media:<br />►Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/">https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/</a><br />►Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/dwnews">https://twitter.com/dwnews</a><br />►Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dwnews">https://www.instagram.com/dwnews</a><br />Für Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch">https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch</a><br /><br /><br />#Belarus #Poland #Migrants{% endraw %}
