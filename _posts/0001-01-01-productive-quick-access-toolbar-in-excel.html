{% raw %}In this video I'll share the items I have on my Quick Access Toolbar (or QAT) in Microsoft Excel. The purpose of the QAT is to help you to be more productive and to find stuff easier. It's to boost your productivity in Excel and Office apps by adding shortcuts to Excel features you use most.  You can add almost any Excel command to the QAT toolbar that is always visible - no matter which ribbon tab is selected. There are also some hidden and useful buttons to add to your QAT that you don't find in the Excel Ribbon. I'll share what I have on my QAT in this video. I'll also show you the new look of the quick access toolbar in Excel for Windows 11 and how you can customize it to match your needs.<br /><br />üåç My Online Excel Courses ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.xelplus.com/courses/">https://www.xelplus.com/courses/</a><br /><br />00:00 How to Customize the Quick Access Toolbar in Excel<br />00:54 The New Office Quick Access Toolbar<br />01:47 How to Customize the Quick Access Toolbar in Excel<br />03:07 Leila's QAT: Print Preview Full Screen<br />04:13: Leila's QAT: Spelling<br />04:51 Leila's QAT: Power Query &amp; Data Model<br />05:48 Leila's QAT: Paste Values<br />06:20 Leila's QAT: $ Sign<br />07:30 Leila's QAT: Collapse/Show Ribbon<br />07:47 Leila's QAT: Camera<br />08:29 Leila's QAT: Calculator<br />09:18 How to Add Leila's Items to QAT<br />12:06 Wrap Up<br /><br />üé¨ LINK to Excel Basics Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKyx1KSoobwukzf1Nf-Y97Rw0">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKyx1KSoobwukzf1Nf-Y97Rw0</a><br /><br />üéí Get the Official XelPlus MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://xelplus.creator-spring.com/">https://xelplus.creator-spring.com/</a><br /><br />üéì Not sure which of my Excel courses fits best for you?
