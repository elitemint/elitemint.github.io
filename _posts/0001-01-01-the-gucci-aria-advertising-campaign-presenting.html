{% raw %}Presenting the new Gucci Aria campaign, envisioned by Alessandro Michele as an exploration of the Ontology of Desire. Set in the secretive and seductive atmosphere of a hotel, the choice of location speaks to the place where it all began The Savoy Hotel in London where founder Guccio Gucci worked as a liftboy in his youth. Featured in the campaign, shot by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, are band Måneskin and model Kristen McMenamy.
