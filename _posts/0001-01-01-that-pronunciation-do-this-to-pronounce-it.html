{% raw %}Do you know how to pronounce ‘that’ without making THIS common mistake?<br />In this video you will learn how to correctly pronounce the word ‘that’, and how to avoid the common mistakes that most people make when using ‘that’ in English speech.<br /><br />The word ‘that’ can be really difficult to pronounce because of 2 sounds that it contains. The ð sound (th) at the beginning of the word, and the ‘t’ sound at the end of the word.<br /><br />The ð sound is one of the hardest sounds to pronounce in English due to the fact that most languages don’t have it. As a result when people pronounce ‘that’ in conversation, they usually replace ‘ð’ with another sound instead...usually the ‘t’ sound - /tat/<br /><br />The second difficulty is with the ‘t’ sound at the end of the word. The ‘t’ sound is a plosive sound which means that it ‘explodes’ out your mouth.  It can feel unnatural to make this sound at the end of a word, so people normally do one of 2 things. <br />Either they over exaggerate the sound - making it sound like another syllable - /ða.tə/, <br />They don’t pronounce it at all - /ða/.<br /><br />In the video I break the word down and show you how to pronounce all sounds correctly, I then give you some simple exercises to help you learn the sounds, and finally put everything together.<br /><br />If you struggle with either of these sounds then I recommend watching the following tutorials which focus on the individual sounds in more detail.<br /><br />ð sound (th) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiRxQJ6miOI&amp;t=3s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiRxQJ6miOI&amp;t=3s</a><br />t sound - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR3LdfIVPE8&amp;t=5s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR3LdfIVPE8&amp;t=5s</a><br /><br />As a British Accent Coach I specialise in helping professionals to learn the British Accent, and speak clear English with confidence and with credibility.<br /><br />***Join me in London with on Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/englishschool.online/">https://www.instagram.com/englishschool.online/</a><br />***On Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/englishpronunciationclub/">https://www.facebook.com/englishpronunciationclub/</a><br />English School Online: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://englishschool.online/">http://englishschool.online/</a><br />Private English accent reduction coaching: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://michaelrobertsenglish.com">http://michaelrobertsenglish.com</a><br /> <br /><br />Learn English Pronunciation and the British accent on Youtube with Michael Roberts.
