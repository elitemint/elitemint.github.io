{% raw %}We secured our first group-stage victory in the Womenâ€™s Champions League on Thursday night as we beat Hoffenheim 4-0 at Meadow Park.<br /><br />Tobin Heath scored her first goal for the club, while Leah Williamson also found the back of the net and delivered an outstanding individual performance.<br /><br />After losing 4-1 to Barcelona in our opening fixture, we had a point to prove and wasted no time in asserting our dominance over the German outfit, with Beth Mead charging into the area and winning a penalty. Kim Little stepped up and made no mistake in sending the keeper the wrong way and finding the bottom corner.<br /><br />We then went on to double our advantage before the break with an impressive passing move. The ball eventually worked its way back to Katie McCabe and with a whipped delivery, Vivianne Miedema cushioned a header into the path of Heath, who fired a half-volley into the far corner for her first goal in Arsenal colours.<br /><br />Miedema led the line superbly all night and shortly after the restart grabbed her reward for a fine performance. Jordan Nobbs latched on to a cutback and forced Martina Tufekovic into a save, but as usual, Miedema was in the right place at the right time to pounce on the loose ball and convert from less than two yards out.<br /><br />Manuela Zinsberger then went on to produce a number of outstanding saves to keep her clean sheet intact, before Williamson made it four with a thumping near-post header from a corner.<br /><br />#arsenal #championsleague #miedema #tobinheath <br /><br />Enjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Vivianne Miedema, Nicolas Pepe, Alexandre Lacazette, Leah Williamson, Bernd Leno, Emile Smith Rowe, Nikita Parris, Tobin Heath, Mana Iwabuchi, Jordan Nobbs, Bukayo Saka, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White, Thomas Partey and more.<br /><br />Subscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://arsn.al/youtube">https://arsn.al/youtube</a><br />Follow us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://arsn.al/facebook">https://arsn.al/facebook</a><br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://arsn.al/twitter">https://arsn.al/twitter</a><br />Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://arsn.al/instagram">https://arsn.al/instagram</a><br />Follow us on TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://arsn.al/tiktok">https://arsn.al/tiktok</a><br /><br />This is the Official YouTube channel for Arsenal Football Club.<br /><br />For more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.
