{% raw %}The sound of an air conditioner is perfect for helping you fall asleep. Play this relaxing white noise to help you get to sleep and stay sleeping all night long. The 10 hour ambience calms your mind, blocks out distractions and ensures a night of good rest.<br /><br />This sound is similar to our fan white noise videos, but it has a deeper rumble which is especially soothing. The sound masking of the AC can also be used as a study aid. Others may find the noise helpful for temporarily masking the symptoms of tinnitus, or ringing in the ears.<br /><br />If you like this air conditioner sound, you may also like these relaxing ambiences:<br />Fan White Noise: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/qorkD6nPYQM">https://youtu.be/qorkD6nPYQM</a><br />Airplane Sound: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/8ygg2xI2hg8">https://youtu.be/8ygg2xI2hg8</a><br />Box Fan: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/2DSWX4ReYgQ">https://youtu.be/2DSWX4ReYgQ</a><br /><br />Please subscribe to our channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/RelaxingWhiteNoise">https://www.youtube.com/user/RelaxingWhiteNoise</a><br />Follow us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2a3k3HB">http://bit.ly/2a3k3HB</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER:<br /><br />Remember that loud sounds can potentially damage your hearing.
