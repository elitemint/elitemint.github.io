{% raw %}2021 started with Donald Trump, on January 6, directing his supporters to go to the US Capitol and &quot;stop&quot; the certification of the election's results. Of course, he told them to stop the &quot;steal&quot;, which provides definitive proof that Trump was lying to inspire and incite the attack, as his own administration officials and agencies said the election was not stolen. <br /><br />But if 2021 was the year of The Big Lie, 2022 will prove to be the year of The Big Truth. The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack has promised public hearings in early 2022. Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson has also indicated that the committee is considering criminal referrals for Trump and company. Moreover, the Department of Justice continues to investigate, indict and prosecute the foot soldiers of the insurrection, in what should be viewed as phase one of the Capitol attack investigation. Indeed, DOJ is following the standard prosecutorial blueprint in large-scale gang or RICO investigations: start at the bottom and work your way up the criminal ladder. <br /><br />Here's why these two things - the House select committee's investigation and criminal referrals, and the DOJ's criminal investigation of the insurrection - will converge to make 2022 the year of accountability. Because justice matters. <br /><br />For our Team Justice and Justice Matters merchandise shop, please visit: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.spreadshirt.com/glennkirschner/">https://shop.spreadshirt.com/glennkirschner/</a><br /><br />Please consider becoming a #TeamJustice patron at:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/glennkirschner">https://www.patreon.com/glennkirschner</a><br /><br />My podcast, &quot;Justice Matters with Glenn Kirschner&quot; can be downloaded where you get your podcasts.
