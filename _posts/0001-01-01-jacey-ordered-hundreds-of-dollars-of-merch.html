{% raw %}Jacey spent hundreds of dollars on Amazon, mostly on gymnastics equipmen  and my husband has been spending a lot of time cancelling as much as he could but there's still stuff coming in. She literally thinks money grows on trees. Honestly, it's her dads fault because he told he she can put stuff in the cart not knowing she knew how to go through with the purchase.{% endraw %}
