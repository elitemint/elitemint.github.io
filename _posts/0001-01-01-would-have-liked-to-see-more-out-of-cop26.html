{% raw %}The Australia Institute’s Richie Merzian says he “would’ve liked to see more” out of the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow.  <br />  <br />“Hopefully, we’ll see more in the next two weeks, but there’s going to be further COPs,” Mr Merzian told Sky News’ Political Editor, Andrew Clennell.  <br />  <br />&quot;It’s not the end of it – we’re going to have another COP, and another COP, and another COP.  <br />  <br />“This is an incremental process; you’re going to get bit by bit.”{% endraw %}
