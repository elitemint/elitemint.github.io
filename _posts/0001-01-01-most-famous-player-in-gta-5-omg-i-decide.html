{% raw %}I decide to become the most famous player in GTA 5! I mean how hard could that be? Just get a cool car, maybe do some stunts, become a movie star or appear on Weazel News! Turns out none of those things work... but what does work is plastic surgery! And I've been turned into Keanu Reeves! <br /><br />Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure game and on my YouTube Channel, I play with GTA 5 mods and create story-driven videos featuring all kinds of funny characters!
