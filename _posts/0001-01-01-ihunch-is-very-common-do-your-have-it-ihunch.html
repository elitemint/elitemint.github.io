Steve is the creator of the Backpod. The Backpod is a practical New Zealand innovation developed to address a problem which was either ignored or misunderstood for far too long. It has been developed by New Zealander Steve August, a physiotherapist for over 30 years', with extensive experience in treating back and neck pain issues. The tool has had an extremely positive reception in the professional community and from customers who have genuinely found a solution to a painful and debilitating physical issue. It is especially effective for the very common hunched back and/or tightened upper back that drives most neck pain and headache. Statistically, most people will experience this problem at some point; one in six people will be in acute pain right now; and everyone knows someone who is stooped and sore - usually hunching over a laptop, tablet or smartphone has an element of cause.<br /><br />Backpod Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bodystance.co.nz/">https://www.bodystance.co.nz/</a><br />Backpod Video Short:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qqDUWmNV3Y&amp;t=15s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qqDUWmNV3Y&amp;t=15s</a><br />Backpod Video Long:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsfPzEOJ0hE&amp;t=12s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsfPzEOJ0hE&amp;t=12s</a><br />Video by Steve August &quot;Costochondritis and Tietzeâ€™s Syndrome:  The published medical research on how to fix them:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8k2LCLeR24&amp;t=7s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8k2LCLeR24&amp;t=7s</a>  <br /><br />Interested in learning more about the products mentioned in today's video: <br />Backpod: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3w7U8J5">https://amzn.to/3w7U8J5</a><br /><br />Video Chapters:<br />0:00 Intro Song<br />0:08 Steve August Introduction<br />0:59 Costochondritis Information<br />1:37 Background on iHunch<br />2:58 How iHunch Can Cause Musculoskeletal Pain<br />14:45 Problems that iHunch Can Cause<br />15:57 How iHunch Causes Headaches<br />20:57 Psychological &amp; Physiological Effects of iHunch<br />29:26 How to Correct iHunch <br />38:14 Using the Backpod for iHunch<br />45:56 iHunch &amp; Shoulder Pain<br />48:24 Musculoskeletal Problems That the Backpod Can Help With<br />48:55 How Our Posture Changes Due to iHunch<br />52:40 How Often Should You Use the Backpod?<br />55:53 Different Back Manipulation Methods<br />58:56 A Simple Stretch to Help With iHunch<br />1:01:38 How Massage Can Help With iHunch<br />1:04:26 Backpod Booklet Information<br />1:04:55 Strengthening Exercises to Help With iHunch<br />1:09:15 Ending Remarks<br /><br />Some of our astute followers have noticed me slurring my words.
