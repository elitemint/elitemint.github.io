He said it will just be them onscreen responding to queries so they can moderate the content themselves.<br />&quot;This particular story ultimately centres on the fact that Harry and Meghan are gearing up allegedly for a busy 2022. One of the ideas that they're looking [at], is making sure they make their mark in the world of media,&quot; he said on his YouTube channel.<br />Sean claimed that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would have to be very vigilant because they once blasted social media as a &quot;harmful place, full of toxicity.&quot; He continued, &quot;Harry and Meghan decided to step back from that even though they had a considerable following on things like Instagram and Twitter when they were part of the British monarchy. But now moving forward, they decided and are toying with the idea of moving back to social media.&quot;<br /><br />#PrinceHarry #TheQueen #Queen #MeghanMarkle #Wedding #anniversary #Diana #PrinceWilliam #Kate #PrinceCharles #Archie #Phillip #PrinceLouis #Dianastatue{% endraw %}
