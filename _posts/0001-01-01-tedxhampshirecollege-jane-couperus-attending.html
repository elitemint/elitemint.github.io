{% raw %}Jane W. Couperus, associate professor of developmental cognitive neuroscience at Hampshire College, pursues research of the development of attention, learning, memory, and their neurological substrates.<br /><br />In this talk, she discusses our awareness of difference, how it helps us and how it may hinder us, too.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.hampshire.edu/">http://www.hampshire.edu/</a><br /><br />About TEDx, x = independently organized event<br />In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations){% endraw %}
