{% raw %}Take an up-close look at the first Tesla Solar Roof in Washington State, installed May 2021 by Artisan Electric Inc and Three Tree Roofing. <br /><br />Unlike traditional solar panels, which are attached to the roof using rails and clamps, Tesla Solar Roof tiles replace traditional roofing material - such as shingles - with photovoltaic cells that produce energy from solar irradiance.<br /><br />The completed roof now produces up to 25 kW of solar through the PV system with building-integrated solar tiles on both the main home and detached garage consisting of (428) 14 cell, 59 solar roof tiles, with 47% (1,880 SF) of the roof tiles being photovoltaic. The remaining 53% of the Tesla roof tiles are aesthetically identical to the photovoltaic tiles, but produce no power. The system uses (3) 7.6kW Tesla inverters and includes (2) Tesla PowerWalls storing 27 kWh (42 A) of backup power. The estimated annual solar production for this system is 18,000 kWh.<br /><br />Contact us for your personalized system quote today: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://artisanelectricinc.com/about/free-solar-site-assessment/">https://artisanelectricinc.com/about/free-solar-site-assessment/</a>{% endraw %}
