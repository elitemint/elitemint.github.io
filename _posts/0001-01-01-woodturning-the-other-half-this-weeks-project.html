{% raw %}This weeks project is called &quot;the other half&quot; as its the other half of a piece of wood I used to turn &quot;The lost log&quot;, which is a piece of wood I found on the floor while out walking.<br /><br />Originally I wanted to keep the bark on, however too much came off during turning so the entire lot was removed, followed by a re-sand of the back.<br /><br />Finished with several coats of Danish Oil only. Plenty of spalting and burl down the one side. <br /><br />My Website - mjturning.com{% endraw %}
