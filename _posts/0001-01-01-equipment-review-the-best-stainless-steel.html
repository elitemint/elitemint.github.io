{% raw %}Perfect searing, flavorful sauces, and stove-to-oven versatility make stainless-steel frying pans a hot item. But can you get a great one for less than $100?<br /><br />Buy Our Winning Stainless Steel Skillet: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cooks.io/2D1JWbN">https://cooks.io/2D1JWbN</a><br />Behind the Testing: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cooks.io/2VCPjpj">https://cooks.io/2VCPjpj</a><br />Full Testing Details and Ranking Chart: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cooks.io/2FoKv18">https://cooks.io/2FoKv18</a><br /><br />Watch more equipment reviews: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDfNwXXESiU&amp;list=PLE720EF13D4C23DDC">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDfNwXXESiU&amp;list=PLE720EF13D4C23DDC</a><br /><br />Check our our Is it Bad? series: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcg-auvLHlw&amp;list=PLnbzopdwFrnYk4goXGnZqSCv6_EeR-8Vt">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcg-auvLHlw&amp;list=PLnbzopdwFrnYk4goXGnZqSCv6_EeR-8Vt</a><br /><br />Bottom line: We can’t fully recommend any of the pans that cost less than $100.00. None of the truly cheap pans met our standards. A few of the pans closer to the $100.00 mark were OK, but none was as good as our longtime favorite, which also comes with a useful lid. If you can spend a bit more, we highly recommend the original fully clad skillet, which our tests proved is still the best: the All-Clad d3 Stainless Steel 12&quot; Fry Pan with Lid ($119.99). It’s an investment, but it will last a lifetime.<br /><br />ABOUT US: Located in Boston’s Seaport District in the historic Innovation and Design Building, America's Test Kitchen features 15,000 square feet of kitchen space including multiple photography and video studios.
