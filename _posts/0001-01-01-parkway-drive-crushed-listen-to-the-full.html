Is this all that we are<br />Sisters, my sisters. We’ve been crushed by the fists of god<br /> <br />Welcome to the free world<br />Where nothing’s as it seems<br />Tell me, can you find a cure<br />When you can’t see, and you can’t feel the disease<br />Can you seek a higher truth<br />When you’re living on your knees<br />Where freedom grows from blood soaked soil<br />In the lands of hypocrisy<br /> <br />Because if you can’t see the chains tell me what use is a key<br />It’s cash, blood and oil, in the age of the refugee<br />They’re trying to buy our minds, we ain’t selling<br />Bang, bang, bang, hear they’re nailing down the coffins<br /> <br />Cut the strings, feel your heart start<br />Cut the cord<br />Crack this code of silence<br />All our lives in the hands of tyrants<br /> <br />Crushed by the fists of god. Crushed<br /> <br />We’ve been crushed by the fists of god<br /> <br />To the left I see the rats and to the right I see the snakes<br />In my ear they’re whispering sweet sermons of cruel hate<br />So do you buy the fear, or do you buy the lies<br />Tell me, what will set us free<br />Do we kneel before the crooked few<br />Or do we bite the fucking hand that feeds<br /> <br />When death casts no shadow and hope carries no weight<br />Rise into the light and feel the shackles fade away<br />They fear what we know, We know how they break<br />Bang, bang, bang, drop the hammer of conscience<br /> <br />Cut the strings, feel your heart start<br />Cut the cord. Crack this code of silence. All our lives<br /> <br />Crushed by the fists of god. Crushed<br /> <br />We’ve been crushed by the fists of god<br /> <br />We’re just waiting for the sky to fall<br />Yeah I’m just waiting<br />Feels like all our lives we’ve been waiting for the sky to fall<br />Feels like all this time we’ve been<br /> <br />Brothers, my brothers<br />Is this all that we are<br />Sisters, my sisters<br />We’ve been<br /> <br />Crushed by the fists of god<br /> <br />Crushed by the fists of god.
