{% raw %}The DIADEM WARRIOR Paddle is a revolution of the pickleball paddle. Designed with multiple new technologies developed by Diadem that enhance <br />the playability of the modern paddle. The 3X L-Core enables a player to feel the ball better on dinks while still creating power on hard hits. Three different <br />honeycomb types are sandwiched to achieve a 19mm  core thickness gives the player an incredible solid and  stable feel. Before the Warrior this sort of thickness  wasnâ€™t achievable without an enormous grip, however, <br />the Taper Tech molded handle has allowed the Warrior  to have a comfortable and slim 4 1/8th grip size. Add  in the unique Grit Paint for excellent spin potential and  the Warrior becomes the most complete paddle on the market. While the paddle is on the heavy side at 8.5oz, <br />the balance and comfort of the design makes it easy to<br />wield. As with the Icon the Warrior uses the highest<br />quality carbon fiber, Polypropylene honeycomb, and<br />introduces the Aramid honeycomb for power.{% endraw %}
