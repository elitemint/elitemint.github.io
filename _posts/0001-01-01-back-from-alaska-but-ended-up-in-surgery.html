{% raw %}You can help support my channel by watching some of the ads, clicking the like button, comment, subscribe and share on any other social media or platform.. It really goes a long way!!!!!<br /><br /><br />About Me. <br />In 2018 I decided to stop working for someone else full time and pursue my dream of building my log home and starting a small farm in the Ozark mountains. It's a dream that I have had and have been working towards for over 20 years, and due to life changes and unexpected events, I decided to make a leap of faith. This journey will not be without its challenges and setbacks, but I will continue to push forward each and every day to make this dream a reality. I try to upload videos 3 days a week but working mostly alone I am always pressed for time. <br />You can also follow me on other social media as well. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Hickory-Ridge-Farmer-Page-357126758224488/">https://www.facebook.com/Hickory-Ridge-Farmer-Page-357126758224488/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hickoryridgehomestead/">https://www.instagram.com/hickoryridgehomestead/</a><br /><br /><br /> 6 Inch Ultra-Thin LED Recessed Ceiling Light with Junction box         <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/36cRvuB">https://amzn.to/36cRvuB</a><br />Hordion 155mm 6.1 inch Hole Saw with Drill Bits &amp; Arbor,                       <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3sW3KVP">https://amzn.to/3sW3KVP</a><br />TORCHSTAR 3 Inch Gimbal LED Dimmable Recessed Light with J-Box                           <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3iO91KD">https://amzn.to/3iO91KD</a><br />Hordion 89mm 3.5 inch Hole Saw with Drill Bits &amp; Arbor                                    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3odcfZa">https://amzn.to/3odcfZa</a><br /><br />Some things I use in making these videos.<br />Arbortech TURBO PLANE <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/33HsovB">https://amzn.to/33HsovB</a> <br />Canon T6I  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2P4Pbfz">https://amzn.to/2P4Pbfz</a><br />Canon 16-35 lens <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2quTkBq">https://amzn.to/2quTkBq</a><br />Gopro <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2LfTLXk">https://amzn.to/2LfTLXk</a><br />Gimbal <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Y6U8c2">https://amzn.to/2Y6U8c2</a><br />My hats. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.stackinbills.com/product-category/all-products/hats/">https://www.stackinbills.com/product-category/all-products/hats/</a><br /><br /><br />Ways to contact me:<br />Hickoryridgefarmer@gmail.com<br />Hickory Ridge Homestead<br />PO Box 56<br />Dennard Ar. 72629{% endraw %}
