{% raw %}From a family who fell to their doom inside of a rioting volcano to the unfortunate adventurers who got a little too close to the edge of fire-belching mountains – here are ten people who fell into volcanoes! Spoiler, some actually survived!! <br /><br />Subscribe For New Videos! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/UIzLeB">http://goo.gl/UIzLeB</a><br /><br />10: Family Falls into Volcano<br />Volcanoes can be extremely dangerous and scary places and there are thousands of these steep mountains of boiling lava all over the world, many of them open to the public for tourism. <br /><br />9: First Person to Fall into Mt. St. Helens<br />In April of 2008, a man named John Slemp became the first person ever to fall into the crater at Mt St. Helens. As an experienced snowmobiler, John Slemp was out having the time of his life.<br /><br />8: Go-Pro Volcano Dive<br />It's one thing to accidentally fall into a volcano. It is something altogether different when you volunteer to dive into one! Yet that's exactly what George Kourounis did back in 2019 at the Marum Crater, located inside of an active volcano in the South Pacific.<br /><br />7: Vacation Gone Wrong<br />The island of Bali in Indonesia is one of the most popular resort islands in the world. It's insanely popular with Europeans and Australians, as a place to hang out, drink some beers, and enjoy the beautiful weather.<br /><br />6: Death in the Congo<br />Moving across the world to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we see yet another tourist who tragically died falling into another boiling volcano. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is a much more obscure tourist destination than the island resort of Bali. Here's how the death happened. <br /><br />5: Body Shaming Fall of Death <br />We're going to simmer down for our next story. Rather than falling into a volcano, Korisa Miller fell into a frozen lake while ice fishing with her best friend at Beacon Cove Marina in Michigan. She apparently slipped, banged her knee on the dock, then plummeted into the icy cold waters! <br /><br />4: New Zealand Volcano Disaster<br />Now moving back to volcanoes. Slipping into a volcano is definitely a tragic event, but most of these incidents happen the same way. Somebody trips, somebody is not paying attention, somebody thinks they can cross the safety line and live to tell the tale, and somebody falls into a giant hole filled with sizzling lava.<br /><br />3: Flying Over a Volcano<br />Imagine flying over a volcano while wearing a wingsuit. If you can't, that's because it's absolutely preposterous. What if something went wrong, your wingsuit didn’t do what it was supposed to, and you literally fell out of the clouds directly into a bubbling pit of fire in the heart of a volcano?<br /><br />2: Dead in the Kilauea Crater<br />Hawaii itself is a volcano. All the Hawaiian Islands are made from the leftovers of volcanic eruptions. Because of this, it should be absolutely no surprise that sometimes, people tumble into the very volcanoes that they live on. <br /><br />1: Volcano Survivor<br />Not everyone who falls into a volcano dies. In 2007, a man fell into an active lava flow and pulled himself back out of it. But how is this possible? Well, he fell into Ol Doinyo Lengai, which is one of the most bizarre volcanoes in the world.<br /><br />#stupidpeople #volcanoes #tourists #worldlist{% endraw %}
