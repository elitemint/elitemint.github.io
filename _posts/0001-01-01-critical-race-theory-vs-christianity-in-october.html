{% raw %}In October 2021, a church in New Jersey asked Dr. Frank Turek to give a presentation on Critical Race Theory because the issue was dividing their church and community. A capacity crowd of about 500 showed up and heard Frank address these three questions:<br /><br />1. What does the culture mean by social justice? <br />2. What are the fundamentals of critical theory? <br />3. How does it line up with Biblical Christianity? <br /><br />He then answered questions from the audience for about 30 minutes. <br /><br />There’s a lot of ground covered in this presentation, but if you want to go further you might want to check out the website of Dr. Neil Shenvi at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shenviapologetics.com/">https://shenviapologetics.com/</a><br /><br />▶️ 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗹𝗶𝘀𝘁:<br />00:00:00 Intro<br />00:01:07 1.
