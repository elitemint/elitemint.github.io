In turn, the Russian warship warned the US destroyer through an international communication channel about the inadmissibility of such actions. <br /><br />The Ministry of Defence said that 'Chafee' was notified about its presence in the area closed to navigation due to artillery firing as part of the joint Russian-Chinese exercise. <br /><br />The ministry added that the US destroyer, having received the warning, did not leave the closed area but raised flags indicating that the helicopter was preparing to take off from the deck. Thus, the US vessel signalled its inability to change course and speed.<br /><br />According to the ministry, the destroyer 'Admiral Tributs' then set a course to push the 'Chafee' out of Russian territorial waters, acting within the framework of international maritime rules. When the Russian vessel was about 60 metres away, the US destroyer reversed course. <br /><br />The ministry described 'the actions of the crew of the US Navy destroyer 'Chafee' as a gross violation of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea and the 1972 US-Russian Intergovernmental Agreement on the Prevention of Incidents on the High Seas and in the Airspace Above It.'<br /><br />The US military attache was summoned on Friday to the Main Directorate for International Military Cooperation of Russia's Ministry of Defence.<br /><br />#Russia #USdestroyer #Trespassing #SeaOfJapan<br /><br />    Video ID: 20211015-053<br /><br />    Video on Demand: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ruptly.tv/videos/20211015-053">https://ruptly.tv/videos/20211015-053</a><br />    Contact: cd@ruptly.tv    <br /><br />    Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/Ruptly">http://twitter.com/Ruptly</a><br />    Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/Ruptly">http://www.facebook.com/Ruptly</a>{% endraw %}
