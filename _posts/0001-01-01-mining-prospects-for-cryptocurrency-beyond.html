{% raw %}I've been researching ACIS Miners (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.asicminervalue.com)">https://www.asicminervalue.com)</a> as Helium Mining has got me looking into other mining options. But as miners in different locations go, PlanetWater with their Awair (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.getawair.com/products/element)">https://www.getawair.com/products/element)</a> and Deeper Network with their own HNT Miner and RPR miner (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://order.deeper.network/product/deeper-connect-mini-hnt-miner)">https://order.deeper.network/product/deeper-connect-mini-hnt-miner)</a> may be an interesting way to go. Too bad nothing is ever in stock.{% endraw %}
