{% raw %}To continue the conversation about the Francis Papacy, check out the STM Online: Crossroads course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/Uvc41q">https://goo.gl/Uvc41q</a><br /><br />November 10, 2016<br />Presenter: Richard Gaillardetz<br /><br />Both supporters and critics have recognized the distinctive character of the pontificate of our first Jesuit and South American pope.  Some have been skeptical, however, as to whether the “newness” is a matter of style or substance.  Is the Francis moment just that, a moment, one easily set aside by his successors, or are we seeing the beginning of a new ecclesial trajectory for the ministry of the Bishop of Rome?<br /><br />Cosponsored by the School of Theology and Ministry and The Church in the 21st Century Center <br /><br />Richard Gaillardetz is Joseph Professor of Catholic Systematic Theology, and chair, Boston College Department of Theology{% endraw %}
