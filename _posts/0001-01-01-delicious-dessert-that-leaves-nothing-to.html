For the berry &amp; white chocolate ice cream, bring the heavy cream to a boil, then melt the chopped white chocolate in it. Stir the mixture together, then let it cool for about 30 minutes. Beat the white chocolate cream until light and fluffy, roughly chop the mixed berries, and carefully fold them into the whipped white chocolate cream. Pour ¾ of the mixture into a large decorative bowl and set the rest aside for later. Press a small bowl into the center of the white chocolate cream to form a well in the center of the ice cream cake. Transfer the decorative bowl to the freezer and freeze the ice cream cake for 6 hours.<br /><br />2. For the berry &amp; rum filling, set a side about 2 oz of the mixed berries, then puree the remaining mixed berries along with the rum. Divide the berry &amp; rum puree into 2 equal portions and stir the whole berries you set aside earlier into 1 of the portions. Take the berry &amp; white chocolate ice cream cake out of the freezer, remove the small bowl in its center, and pour the berry &amp; rum filling with extra berries into the well.<br /><br />3. Spread the remainder of the whipped white chocolate cream over the filling and smooth out its surface. Transfer the ice cream lava cake to the freezer and freeze for 2 hours. After the ice cream lava cake has chilled, place a large serving plate over the top of the decorative bowl and flip it over carefully. Remove the bowl and decorate the ice cream lava cake with berry &amp; rum sauce, mixed berries, and fresh mint.<br /><br />This fruity ice cream lava cake isn't just stunning, it's also delicious!
