{% raw %}Episode 24 - Richard explores the strange concept of time, space and gravity as well as how our brains may be organizing reality into the best way to understand it. How much do we really understand about the reality around us, could there be so much more that we as humans are simply not aware of? Richard explains that there are scientists that are working on 'string theories', faster than light travel and multiple realities, but it seems science doesn't have all the answers yet. Could it be that UFO's or extraterrestrial/interdimensional beings are utilizing a form of physics we are yet to discover?<br />This channel is managed by Zohar Entertainment Group UK, Zohar Entertainment Group International Inc, USA and AdRev, USA.{% endraw %}
