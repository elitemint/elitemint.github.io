{% raw %}Several species of social caterpillars such as this cluster from the Amazon Rainforest can be quite sensitive to sounds as seen in this video from who demonstrates such. Although odd looking, this behavior is thought to actually be a type of defensive maneuver.<br /><br />Parasitoid wasps and flies are known to take a significant chunk out of caterpillar populations each generation. By sticking together and reacting to vibrations, they are thought to be able ward off the harmful insects. How cool is that!?”<br /><br /><br />#Naturalworld​ #Natural​ #Beautiful​ #Youtube​ #Videos​ #Video​ #Trends​ #Trend​ #fyb​ #sun​ #Nzertv​ #Shorts​ #Nzerplus #Explore #Animals #Animal{% endraw %}
