{% raw %}The Password Is Incorrect After Update in Windows 10 FIX.<br /><br />The error &quot;The password is incorrect. Try again&quot; may appear after a Windows 10 update. The strange thing about this problem is that when it happens, the system does not display the password box to type the password, and the problem may even occur to users who do not have a password (the password is blank).<br /><br />Windows 10 is the latest and one of the most popular versions of Microsoft Windows. However, after the recent Windows 10 update, some users have reported the “Username or Password Incorrect” bug upon starting their PC. The bug may seem like a nuisance, but, in reality, it can easily be fixed.<br /><br />Some Windows 10 are reporting that they are unable to log into their Windows 10 computer after the initial log in screen is not accepting their password. The vast majority of users are saying that they are certain that the password their typing is 100% correct. Some users are reporting that they’re encountering this issue with only one Windows account, while others are saying that none of the Windows Account passwords are getting accepted.<br /><br />In the recent update, Windows 10 introduced a new feature called “Improved Boot-Up Experience.” This feature allows you to set up your sign-in information to apply settings after every restart and update. The “Windows 10 Password Not Working” error is basically a result of this newly added feature. If you’re facing the same issues after your Windows 10 update, then this article is for you.<br /><br /><br />This tutorial will apply for computers, laptops, desktops, and tablets running the Windows 10 operating system (Home, Professional, Enterprise, Education) from all supported hardware manufactures, like Dell, HP, Acer, Asus, Toshiba, Lenovo, and Samsung).{% endraw %}
