{% raw %}It's here! The reunion episode we alluded to on Instagram! We're back together in person for episode 244 to try to make Christine's water break through surprise cryptid baby showers. We may or may not have disturbed every ghost in Christine's home so buckle in for this wild ride. This week Em relives their Denver ghost tour to tell the story of the Peabody-Whitehead Mansion. Then Christine goes to an appointment with her midwife and comes back, still pregnant, to tell us the story of Michael and Suzan Carons aka the Witch Killers. <br /><br />Christine also accidentally gendered the baby on air, so good thing she's already given birth! Check the 'gram for more pics and deets... and that's why we drink! <br /><br />Also, check out Flying Pig Tours in Cincinnati and Denver Terrors ghost tours!{% endraw %}
