{% raw %}In this example, your boat has a compass heading of 090 degrees, so it follows that the reciprocal heading is 270 degrees - 090 degrees plus 180 degrees.  <br />The reading of the boats wake by hand bearing compass is 265 degrees.  <br />The difference between 270 and 265 is 5 degrees.  <br />Your leeway angle is therefore 5 degrees.  <br />If the wind is from the starboard side, you have to add the leeway angle - 5 degrees, to your compass heading - 090 degrees.  <br />To offset the effect of the wind on your boat, your compass heading must be 095 degrees. <br />Memorize the following rules: wind from port side: water track minus leeway angle = course to steer.<br />Wind from starboard side. water track plus leeway angle = course to steer.{% endraw %}
