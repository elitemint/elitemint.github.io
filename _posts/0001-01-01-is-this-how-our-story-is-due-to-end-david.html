{% raw %}Sir David Attenborough warned that humanity is “already in trouble” as he addressed delegates at a rousing speech at the opening ceremony of COP26. <br /><br />The climate campaigner stressed that our motivation “must not be fear but hope” for change and that young people “give us the impetus we need to rewrite our story”. <br /><br />Elsewhere, the Prince of Wales told delegates that nations “must come together to create the environment that enables every sector of industry to take the action required”.<br /><br />He added: “We know this will take trillions, not billions, of dollars. We also know that countries, many of whom are burdened by growing levels of debt, simply cannot afford to ‘go green’.”<br /><br />Follow the Evening Standard's latest COP26 coverage here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/cop26-glasgow-latest-updates-boris-johnson-prince-charles-speech-joe-biden-b963598.html">https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/cop26-glasgow-latest-updates-boris-johnson-prince-charles-speech-joe-biden-b963598.html</a><br /><br />Subscribe to the Evening Standard on YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7RQon_YwCnp_LbPtEwW65w?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7RQon_YwCnp_LbPtEwW65w?sub_confirmation=1</a>{% endraw %}
