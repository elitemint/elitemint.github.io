{% raw %}It's no surprise that the rope chain is a very popular choice. The 18KT ropes do really well and I wanted to give my opinion as to why I would recommend one of these chains. The answer might come as to some what of a surprise. It really depends on what's important to you regarding 14KT vs 18KT.
