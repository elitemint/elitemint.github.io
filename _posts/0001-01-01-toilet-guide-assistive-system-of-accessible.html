{% raw %}Abstract:<br />Physically disabled people have many problems using accessible toilets. They hope the improvement of accessible toilets. It is hard to find appropriate accessible toilet in unfamiliar environment. Even if they find one, the accessible toilet usually lacks of assisting equipments. They can find no device to contact with their friends or family when they have emergency. Though there exist many adjustable and smart devices, no system in toilet controls them all. Our team designed a system, Toilet Guide, that uses the Internet of Things to integrate smart devices in accessible toilets. The system starts with finding accessible toilets, and then providing routes to the best accessible toilets according to the scores. After the user arrives the accessible toilet, they scan the QR code and connect to Toilet Guide and adjust the settings of each device via phone app or touch screen. When users have emergency, emergency button is always available on every interface. After the use, they can leave score or comment. Toilet Guide gives physically disabled people convenient and smooth experience.  We not only integrated the devices inside the toilet, but present a function to remember the settings. This allows users to only adjust one time toward the same toilet. Previous settings could be restored in the next use.{% endraw %}
