{% raw %}In this talk, Anansh speaks about the importance of instilling the curiosity to keep abreast with the happenings of the world. In an era where core academics is often taking precedence over soft skill development and general knowledge (especially in South Asia), it has become crucial to focus on enhancing GK and general awareness among students. Anansh talks about why this is important and how it can be achieved in this enlightening talk.

He has personally conducted workshops for over 30000+ students and teachers since 2013. <br /><br />Anansh is also a voracious reader, sports fanatic, guitarist and lifelong learner.
