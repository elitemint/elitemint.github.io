{% raw %}Judge Jeanine Pirro is pushing the idea that the Omicron variant is a hoax and she had Lara Logan on to bolster her conspiracy theory.

She doesn't go for that. She goes for the straight-up martini to the face. Multiple and then here is just kidding.<br />Sam: Is this the one where she complains about the naming of it that I sent Bradley? Get that one, please. Let's do I mean because this is it's like these people are children it's just unbelievable that they walk off the set and go like we really helped out today with this whole pandemic thing.<br />Emma: Yeah they probably don't even do that though. <br />Pirro: Well you know what larry you know what strikes me that this omicron you know instead of calling it the south Africa virus they took weeks to figure out a new name so nobody could say it's the virus from the variant from south Africa. Isn't it interesting that they decided to name it this before we even heard about it?<br />Sam: Like I'm trying to figure out and we'll play the other clip in a second Bradley. But I'm trying to figure out why she's basically saying like they don't want us to blame the black people for the variant. Now aside from everything we just heard where it's more than likely the variant does not do not originate in South Africa. But even if it did, it's just luck of the draw. but it is not the luck of the draw that it was found in South Africa because that is a function of the government putting resources into tracing and analyzing these things in a way that ultimately protects everybody. Everybody. Because if it's not found in South Africa it means that it's probably and it's already in 10-12 different countries. It could be anywhere if they don't find it or if they don't report it that it's found. If this turns out to be bad we're going to be thanking South Africa for letting us know about it beforehand so that's some time for preparation. But the idea that they don't want to like the Spanish flu. It started in Kansas. It just so happens that in Spain they were like hey wait a second there's a flu here. and so all of a sudden it becomes Spanish.<br />Emma: It could very well be the US variant we just don't have that we don't know right like new york state now they're internet to know there are almost 10 test positivity rates in some areas because they think omicron has been here already we don't need to less testing but then she'd call it the New York variant.<br />Matt: Look at what happened to the markets. You imagine what people with money felt about South Africa's advanced capabilities to find new variants. Look at what hexa thought like punishing them there's a lot of people that want to punish them because they'd rather not know.<br />Sam: yep play the other clip with these lunatics.<br />Logan: Judge if they keep testing for different strains of coronavirus we're going to be locked down for the rest of our existence. I know I had cancer. My oncologist is a specialist in bone cancer and he knows every oncologist who deals with bone cancer identifies hundreds of coronaviruses inside of our bones. they've created a problem that can never actually be solved. so they can justify whatever it is they want to do.{% endraw %}
