{% raw %}The only real peace<br /><br />Written by Joel Hemphill<br /><br />The Only Real Peace lyrics and chords are intended for your personal use only, it's a great country gospel.<br /><br /><br />Life is a few days of trouble a wise man once said<br />But I’ll not complain for I’m sheltered I’m clothed and I’m fed<br />But many’s the trials my wants and my dreams put me through<br />And the only real peace that I have dear Lord is in you<br />The only real peace that I have dear Lord is in you<br />The only real peace that I have dear Lord is in you<br />With all life’s frustrations I need you and I know I do<br />Cause the only real peace that I have dear Lord is in you<br />The higher I soar in my dreams the harder I fall<br />And sometimes I wonder if dreams are worth dreaming at all<br />But my disappointments can’t keep me blinded and blue<br />Not when I'm reminded of sweet peace I have Lord in you{% endraw %}
