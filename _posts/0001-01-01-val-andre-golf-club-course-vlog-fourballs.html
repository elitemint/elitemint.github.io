{% raw %}VAL ANDRE Golf Club - Course Vlog - FOURBALLS - Part 1<br /><br />Val Andre is in the Côtes-d'Armor department of Brittany in northwestern France.<br /><br />Just a short Ferry adventure from Portsmouth England, to St Malo France and then 1 hour west and we find ourselves in the stunning area of Val Andre.<br /><br />Myself (Dan Hendriksen), Lee Whittaker, Coach James Urquhart and Old Fold Manor Golf Operations Manager Nathan Gilpin, along with more than.just a cameraman Jordan are making our way around this beautiful 18 hole golf course right on the coast of Normandy with some spectacular views and stunning golf holes. <br /><br />In today's match, it will be a 3 part series, 6 holes in each part, where Myself and Lee will go against James and Nathan for 6 holes of Fourballs, 6 holes of Scramble and finally 6 holes of Greensomes. I hope you enjoy the longer parts, and that you find changing up the formats refreshing.<br /><br />Book your own trip to Val Andre:<br /><br />With exceptional views along the coast, Pléneuf-Val-André is an outstanding seaside course. A mix of clifftop links and heathland, it boasts some truly memorable holes that combine undulating fairways, thick rough, and well-protected greens. Holes 9 to 12 are particularly worthy of mention and can make or break your round, but the rest of the course is impressive - including some corking short holes. Regularly ranked among the top 10 courses in France, green fees are a fraction of the price you'd pay for an equivalent course in the UK.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.brittany-ferries.co.uk/holidays/collections/golf/northern-brittany">https://www.brittany-ferries.co.uk/holidays/collections/golf/northern-brittany</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching, please comment on the video if you have time.<br /><br />Subscribe for more on the channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZXnimT8a-hjIVMRxD57xAQ/videos?disable_polymer=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZXnimT8a-hjIVMRxD57xAQ/videos?disable_polymer=1</a><br /><br />Epidemic Sound, where I get the music I use for all my videos:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/44i2n6/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/44i2n6/</a><br /><br />Follow my website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.dhgolf.co.uk">http://www.dhgolf.co.uk</a><br />For business inquiries contact me at: dh@dhgolf.co.uk<br /><br />In My Bag:<br />Driver: Titleist TSi3: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.titleist.co.uk/golf-clubs/golf-drivers/tsi3">https://www.titleist.co.uk/golf-clubs/golf-drivers/tsi3</a><br />3 Wood: Titleist TSi2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.titleist.co.uk/golf-clubs/fairway-woods/tsi2">https://www.titleist.co.uk/golf-clubs/fairway-woods/tsi2</a><br />5 Wood: TaylorMade RBZ<br />7 Wood: Titleist TSi2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.titleist.co.uk/golf-clubs/fairway-woods/tsi2">https://www.titleist.co.uk/golf-clubs/fairway-woods/tsi2</a><br />Irons: Cobra Tour Mim 4 to PW - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cobragolf.co.uk/king-tour-irons">https://www.cobragolf.co.uk/king-tour-irons</a><br />Wedges: Titleist Vokey 54/12 D &amp; 58/10 S:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.titleist.co.uk/golf-clubs/wedges/sm8">https://www.titleist.co.uk/golf-clubs/wedges/sm8</a><br />Putter: Scotty Cameron Newport 2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.titleist.co.uk/golf-clubs/putters/special-select">https://www.titleist.co.uk/golf-clubs/putters/special-select</a><br />Ball: Pro V 1: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.titleist.co.uk/product/pro-v1/003PV1T.html">https://www.titleist.co.uk/product/pro-v1/003PV1T.html</a><br />Range Finder: Bushnell Pro XE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bushnellgolfglobal.com/tour-v5-shift/?aff=2">https://bushnellgolfglobal.com/tour-v5-shift/?aff=2</a><br /><br />Clothing, Shoes &amp; Glove: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.footjoy.co.uk">https://www.footjoy.co.uk</a><br /><br />Let's Connect:<br /><br />Dan:<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/hendriksengolf">https://twitter.com/hendriksengolf</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/danhendriksen/">https://www.instagram.com/danhendriksen/</a><br />FaceBook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/hendriksengolf/">https://www.facebook.com/hendriksengolf/</a>{% endraw %}
