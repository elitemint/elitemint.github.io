{% raw %}After losing the opening playoff game against Harvard Westlake, Corona Centennial path to the championship relied on 4 variables, 2 of which they controlled. In order to win, they had to win both of their remaining games, as well as have Harvard Westlake, the team that beat them, lose both of their games.  Over the course of 2 weeks, they handled business and ended up with a shot at the championship against Amari Bailey, Bronny James and Sierra Canyon on live tv in front of LeBron, Drake, JR Smith, Lil Bibby and probably more... With a team full of underclassmen aside from two players, they went on the road and handled business one more time....<br /><br />1m subs would be cool: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3a4GHk7">https://bit.ly/3a4GHk7</a><br />me: @Celly  <br /><br />INTRO BEAT PROD.  @TCustomz Productionz  <br /><br />send stuff here<br />PO BOX 795<br />Winchester, CA 92596<br /><br />0:00 INTRO<br />1:15 Harvard Westlake 1st Half<br />4:30 Halftime<br />5:20 Harvard Westlake 2nd Half<br />14:00 The Loss<br />14:39 Damien 1st Half<br />18:55 Halftime<br />19:52 Damien 2nd Half<br />26:26 Damien Post Game<br />28:32 Mater Dei Must Win<br />30:20 Mater Dei 1st Half<br />35:22 Halftime<br />36:35 Mater Dei 2nd Half<br />39:12 Damien Must Win<br />48:35 The Day Before<br />49:08 Championship Day<br />52:05 Sierra Canyon<br />1:00:53 Halftime<br />1:02:25 The Final 16 Minutes<br />1:17:04 Preparation Meets Opportunity<br />1:22:34 Gefilte Fish<br /><br />For context, CIF southern section playoffs were done in a pool play format. top 8 teams, two pools of 4 teams, winner of each pool plays each other for the ship. SPOILERS<br /><br />Centennial loses their first game to Harvard Westlake, for one because Kylan Boswell was at Team USA Camp, and for two Harvard Westlake young talent plus a couple questionable calls, and their road to a chance at the championship then became they had to beat both Mater Dei and Damien, and hope that Harvard Westlake lost both of their games.  If Centennial lost either game, or Harvard Westlake won one of theirs, Centennial's season would have been over... Centennial took care of business, and thanks to Malik Thomas and RJ Smith leading Damien to an insane comeback win, and Mater Dei handling business at home, Centennial got a ticket to the championship game against Sierra Canyon, now with Bronny back and Drake showing up for some strange reason... The rest is history. <br /><br />#BallerVisions{% endraw %}
