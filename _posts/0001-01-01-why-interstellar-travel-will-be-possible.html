{% raw %}Why Interstellar Travel Will Be Possible Sooner Than You Think!<br /><br />Looking up at the sky as kids, we fantasized about traveling to the stars and other galaxies. Astronomers were able to reach the moon and other celestial bodies within this solar system thanks to powerful, modern, and spectacular space technologies. We commonly witness interplanetary space travel in science fiction movies and serials, with heroes fighting a bunch of extraterrestrials, but is it really conceivable to go to distant galaxies and stars? Is there any technology that can transport us to the deep reaches of space? Is it possible that aliens, like humans, are planning interplanetary travel, and if so, how long will it take them to reach our solar system? Humans have discovered the answers to all these questions, and there are things that can help us travel much sooner than we think. Welcome to Cosmos lab, your one station for all the news from space.<br />This universe is vast, like really really vast. While chemical rockets have transported us to a variety of planets, moons, and other bodies across the Solar System, humanity's farthest spacecraft, Voyager 1, is only 22.3 billion kilometers from Earth, or just 0.056 percent of the distance to the nearest known star system. Traveling to another star system would take over 100,000 years with current technology. The distance is also reassuring in that if aliens do try to invade humanity, they may not be able to cover the distance quickly.<br />It took three days for Apollo to travel to the moon while the distance between Pluto and Earth was covered in 9.5 years by the New Horizons spacecraft. This indicates that it can take up to a minimum of around 10 years to travel to the last planet of the solar system and it will take thousands of years to travel to the other galaxies. According to discovery, If New Horizons was pointed at Proxima Centauri, cruising at the speed of 36,000 miles per hour, it would get to visit our nearest neighbor in about 25,000 years. But how are we going to survive that long?<br />In science fiction movies, we have seen that the distance problem is somehow already solved. You may have seen in numerous movies that interstellar space travelers just sleep in a chamber and wake up after thousands of years as if it were only a day. Well, the problem is solved in the sci-fi world. What are the real-world approaches for resolving it?<br />Given the &quot;insane size&quot; of the distances between stars and galaxies, University of Rochester astrophysicist Adam Frank examines the prospects of interstellar travel in connection to space exploration, whether by humans or intelligent extraterrestrials.<br />Frank has given four solutions for the long distance of interstellar space travel. Cryosleep, solar sails or light sails, wormholes, and warp drives. He provides some thoughts, cautioning that they may all be pipe dreams. Of these four, Cryosleep is maybe the most intriguing one.<br />Cryogenic sleep, also known as suspended animation and cryosleep, refers to a deep sleep at super-low temperatures. By keeping the body at these temperatures, the metabolism is reduced to its lowest possible level. The idea is that the low temperatures will keep vital functions intact while the rest of the body goes into a hibernation-like state.<br />The body's metabolism would be &quot;frozen&quot; for the duration of the travel using cryosleep technology. Despite the fact that this is a mainstay of science fiction, no one has even come close to making it work for higher animals (like mammals). Still, it's the kind of answer that doesn't necessitate the existence of magical new physics â€” or even magical new biology.<br />Researchers have had some luck with raising nematode worms and water bears in space conditions. But these life forms are naturally adapted to survive under conditions that would be lethal for most. Aestivation Hypothesis says advanced life forms exist indefinitely but in a digitized form. But that's not what most of us would think of as interstellar travel anyway. And if we were digital, the galaxies we sped through might as well be our own creations anyway, as opposed to physical explorations of the physical world.<br /><br />interstellar travel, interstellar, interstellar space stravel, space, cosmos, nasa, nasa missions, nasa discoveries, space discoveries, black hole{% endraw %}
