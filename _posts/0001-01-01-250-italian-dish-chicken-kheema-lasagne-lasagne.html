Lasagne Italian are a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as rag√π (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. Typically, cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting casserole is cut into single-serving square portions. This classic lasagna is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family, and freezes well, too. <br /><br />Firangi Bake<br />Fast Food, Italian, Mexican<br />Kakkanad, Kochi<br />No.14/497 - A2 karukatharayil Plaza chittethukara Kakkanad, Kochi, Kerala 682030<br /><br />Chicken Kheema Lasagne<br />‚Çπ250<br />[100% Safely Cooked Chicken] Our signature Italian dish fused with desi flavors - delicious lasagna layered with Kheema and oozing with cheese.
