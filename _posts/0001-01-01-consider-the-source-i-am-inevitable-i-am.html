{% raw %}I Am Inevitable from the upcoming album, Hybrid Vol. 1: Such As A Mule, out on Ropeadope Records Dec. 17th. Pre-order at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hellomerch.com/collections/consider-the-source">https://www.hellomerch.com/collections/consider-the-source</a><br /><br />This song begins with a foreboding tone and gradually builds to a cinematic climax. One of the more layered tracks of the album, this piece draws from classical elements while also including a 100% improvised jam. This track demonstrates the electric side from this Hybrid album.<br /><br />#ConsidertheSource #IAmInevitable{% endraw %}
