{% raw %}Rock Creek, Minn., no-tiller and strip-tiller Jon Stevens gives a detailed overview of how and why he constructed a strip-till rig from Hiniker cultivator row units to suit his rocky soils and soil health goals. Stevens leverages strip-till as a tool to complement his no-till and cover crop objectives and was able to cut phosphorus and potassium application rates in half and save $40 per acre by moving away from full-width tillage.{% endraw %}
