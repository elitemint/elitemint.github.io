{% raw %}It's Turkey Feet and Sticker Pox season! Wash your hands!<br /><br />LET'S BE FRIENDS -- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/a7ctjJ">https://goo.gl/a7ctjJ</a><br /><br />HEY EVERYBODY!! Today me and Niko aren't feeling well.. good thing we have Mom to take care of us. While she was bringing us some cereal and milk, she decided to take our temperature to make sure we weren't running a fever. When she moved my bangs out of the way to feel my forehead.. there was STiCKER POX and they were spreading FAST! We ran downstairs for a doctor's visit, and to get a shot from Dr. Dad! But when we got there he was busy since we didn't make an appointment, so we had to sit in the waiting room and it was SOOO boring! Luckily Dr. Dad had something for us to watch... it's EPiSODE 2 of our FAMiLY CARTOON called &quot;STiCKER POX&quot;!! We are have been so so so excited about this animation because sticker pox is one of our favorite A for Adley videos ever!<br />Today I woke up feeling really weird. I was itchy all over! When looked down at my hand I realized that my body was coved in stickers! I had Sticker Pox!! I grabbed the phone as fast as I could to call the doctor's office so that I could make an appointment!! Luckily they said they were ready right now! I ran to the office where I met Doctor Dad and Nurse Mom for the first time! The doctor grabbed his toolset and tried to pull it open, but the lid flew off and he spilled everything all over the floor! After they cleaned up their mess it was time to get rid of these sticker pox, but it hurt REALLY bad when they pulled them off. Dr. Dad got the numbing shot medicine and gave me a shot on the tip of my nose and I couldn't feel my face! So we pulled off ALL of the sticker pox and I went back to bed for a nap. When I woke up the next morning I got out of bed and had TURKEY FEET so I was brave and went back for another doctor visit! Luckily they had the cure for turkey feet and we got them removed from my feet!<br />We have had SO much fun making our first two Adley cartoons!! And we are already working on our THIRD cartoon!! So we wanted to show you our storyboard where I open my own HAiR SALON and Adley is the boss! That will also be the first episode with Niko in it! I hope you are LOVING our family cartoons as much as we are LOVING to make them!<br />Thank you for being our friends and watching our videos!!<br /><br />Watch Episode 2, Sticker Pox, again on the Spacestation Animation YouTube Channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/NA75jaXcROY">https://youtu.be/NA75jaXcROY</a><br /><br />my last video: CHRiSTMAS TREE CRAFTS  Kids DIY Decorations for the Holidays! decorating our new family xmas tree<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGtqXVI0YDU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGtqXVI0YDU</a><br /><br />my dad's last video: DAD vs KiDS day 4 - Adley &amp; Niko control our day!! magic morning routine and surprising mom home<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMrRuw4QCMM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMrRuw4QCMM</a><br /><br />Bye vlog *pshhhhh*{% endraw %}
