{% raw %}Reminder : This is a friendly (kinda) big bird stretched pelican audio rip off channel, not a political debate forum on which to change the world. We discuss oddities of the show here.<br /><br />Be friendly. Positive. You know the drill. Or be vanished and muted from the channel, you choose.<br /><br />It's not that I am disagreeing with whatever tired opinions you come up with or regurgitate, it's just that I am not interested, and I feel a humble channel for giggles like this is not a suitable enough platform for Your Wisdoms.<br /><br />I am Eric, I will block you.<br /><br />I just posted an old crappy compilation I was asked to upload, enjoy it, don't get serious on us now.<br />PS Some bits repeat im told, I can edit that up and reupload if it bothers people a lot.<br /><br />Support us for more. See our Patreon page for the many files we could not upload here!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/thammut">https://www.patreon.com/thammut</a><br />Buy us a drink if you like. Any help is appreciated and keeps us archiving.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/thammut">https://www.paypal.me/thammut</a><br /><br />We have thousands of hours of audio and video of old episodes we cannot upload here, get access to our growing collection and services on Patreon. All audio collection episodes have had their volume levels normalized with one another, to help people like me, who like to fall asleep or relax to this stuff without having sudden loud episodes wake them! You are welcome.{% endraw %}
