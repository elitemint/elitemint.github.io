{% raw %}This past year, five undergraduate mechanical engineering students have designed, manufactured and constructed an inexpensive, lightweight motorized wheelchair specifically for children such as Tanner and Skyler.<br /><br />The chair is made with a PVC frame (strong enough for a child up to 50 pounds or about 6 years old) and is controlled by an armrest-mounted joystick like other chairs. The students produced the chair for under $495, making it likely the world’s least expensive motorized wheelchair—and possibly lightest at just over 20 pounds.<br /><br />Produced by BYU News<br />Producer Julie Walker<br />Photography Brian Wilcox<br />Editor Michael Gordon{% endraw %}
