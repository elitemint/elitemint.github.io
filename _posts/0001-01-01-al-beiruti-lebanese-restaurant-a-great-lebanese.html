Bright mornings over freshly-made Mankoushé and that perfect cup of coffee, long lunches with the family, afternoons with friends animated by the sounds of Tawlé games, and loungy evenings well spent over a Shisha crafted to perfection by Al Beiruti’s very own Shisha Master. <br />Welcome to Al Beiruti, a new chapter redefining the world of Lebanese Restau-Cafés, bringing bits of Beirut everywhere it goes.<br />.<br />Thank you for watching another video or live coverage by Anthony Rahayel (انطوني رحيّل) NoGarlicNoOnions. &quot;Spreading happiness and Sharing joy&quot; is what I do.<br />.<br />Arabic, French, and English: My Channel Speaks 3 Languages.<br />.<br />Welcome to #AnthonyRahayel, #NoGarlicNoOnions Youtube channel<br />&quot;Always remember; Happiness is a choice...&quot;<br />.<br /><br /><br />.<br />شكرًا لك على مشاهدة مقطع فيديو آخر أو تغطية مباشرة بواسطة NoGarlicNoOnions. &quot;نشر السعادة ومشاركة الفرح&quot; هو ما أفعله<br />.<br />Proudly Lebanese...
