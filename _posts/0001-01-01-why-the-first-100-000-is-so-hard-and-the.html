{% raw %}Why the First $100,000 is so Hard (And the Next is Easy)<br /><br />Charlie Munger, famous billionaire investor and Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway believes that the first $100,000 is the hardest to amass. It’s not just him, though. Many people who have grown their wealth believe this to be true and the same thing is often said about achieving the first million. Once you reach $100,000, the next one tends to come much more quickly. Before you know it, you have $200,000, $300,000 and $400,000. Then once you hit the million dollar mark, the second one is right around the corner and seems to take a fraction of the time as the first. This is reassuring for those of us who feel like their wealth is growing slower than they’d like but why exactly does it get easier? Let’s see why it takes a disproportionately long time to reach the $100,000 mark and discuss some things you can do to speed up this process so you become wealthy years sooner.{% endraw %}
