At that time he was one of the highest<br />authorities in the field of Embryology. He was asked to give his opinion regarding the<br />information present in the Qur’aan concerning the field of embryology. After carefully examining<br />the translation of the Qur’aanic verses presented to him, Dr. Moore said that most of the<br />information concerning embryology mentioned in the Qur’aan is in perfect conformity with<br />modern discoveries in the field of embryology and does not conflict with them in any way. He<br />added that there were however a few verses, on whose scientific accuracy he could not<br />comment. He could not say whether the statements were true or false, since he himself was not<br />aware of the information contained therein.<br />There was also no mention of this information in modern writings and studies on embryology.<br />One such verse is: “Proclaim! (or Read!) In the name Of thy Lord and Cherisher, Who created –<br />Created man, out of A (mere) clot Of congealed blood.” [Al-Qur’aan 96:1-2]<br />The word alaq besides meaning a congealed clot of blood also means something that clings, a<br />leech-like substance. Dr. Keith Moore had no knowledge whether an embryo in the initial stages<br />appears like a leech. To check this out he studied the initial stage of the embryo under a very<br />powerful microscope in his laboratory and compared what he observed with a diagram of a<br />leech and he was astonished at the striking resemblance between the two!<br />In the same manner, he acquired more information on embryology that was hitherto not known<br />to him, from the Qur’aan. Dr. Keith Moore answered about eighty questions dealing with<br />embryological data mentioned in the Qur’aan and Hadith. Noting that the information contained<br />in the Qur’aan and Hadith was in full agreement with the latest discoveries in the field of<br />embryology, Prof. Moore said, “If I was asked these questions thirty years ago, I would not have<br />been able to answer half of them for lack of scientific information” Dr. Keith Moore had earlier<br />authored the book, ‘The Developing Human’. After acquiring new knowledge from the Qur’aan,<br />he wrote, in 1982, the 3rd edition of the same book, ‘The Developing Human’. The book was the<br />recipient of an award for the best medical book written by a single author. This book has been<br />translated into several major languages of the world and is used as a textbook of embryology in<br />the first year of medical studies. In 1981, during the Seventh Medical Conference in Dammam,<br />Saudi Arabia, Dr. Moore said, “It has been a great pleasure for me to help clarify statements in<br />the Qur’aan about human development. It is clear to me that these statements must have come<br />to Muhammad from God or Allah, because almost all of this knowledge was not discovered until<br />many centuries later. This proves to me that Muhammad must have been a messenger of God<br />or Allah.”<br /><br />Dr. Joe Leigh Simpson, Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, at the<br />Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, U.S.A., proclaims: “...these Hadiths, sayings of<br />Muhammad (pbuh) could not have been obtained on the basis of the scientific knowledge that<br />was available at the time of the writer (7th century). It follows that not only is there no conflict<br />between genetics and religion (Islam) but in fact religion (Islam) may guide science by adding<br />revelation to some of the traditional scientific approaches… there exist statements in the<br />Qur’aan shown centuries later to be valid which support knowledge in the Qur’aan having been<br />derived from God.”{% endraw %}
