{% raw %}Former Pentagon adviser Jason Israel says the traditional Hong Kong will likely be lost moving forward as China solidifies into control over the region. <br /><br />Mr Israel pointed to the United Kingdom – which is allowing British national overseas visa holders to return to the UK – and said the move would actually draw pro-democracy residents away from Hong Kong. <br /><br />He said in a speech delivered this week by Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam, there was a clear effort “to make the point that the Communist Party will keep control over Hong Kong and likely will for the foreseeable future”. <br /><br />“The Hong Kong that we know probably is on a trajectory towards ceasing to exist,” Mr Israel said.{% endraw %}
