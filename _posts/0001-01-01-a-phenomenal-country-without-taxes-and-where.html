{% raw %}Today we will tell you about a country that not many people know about and who probably can't find it on a map. It's one of the 7 richest countries in the world based on the level of income and life of the population. Gasoline is cheaper than water, loans are interest-free, the government pays for utilities and sometimes they don't even make loan takers pay their loans back. It's a phenomenal country that was brutally scorched and damaged by its neighbor 30 years ago. Today, skyscrapers grow faster than mushrooms, super expensive and exclusive car sales are greater than your wildest imagination and each citizen receives one servant and 1.5 migrant workers. And the dinar is the most valuable currency in the world. This is Kuwait, one of the world's richest countries. <br />#Pandora US#{% endraw %}
