{% raw %}A Day in the life of a Japanese Hotel Worker in Tokyo.  This is working life in Japan if you were to work in the hotel industry.   In Japan, there’s a unique hospitality custom called OMOTENASHI. Directly translated, Omote meaning public face and nashi meaning nothing, combined it means services are always completely genuine and honest.  Because it’s so deeply rooted in Japanese culture, the staff make extra efforts to provide guests with the best experience possible without expecting anything in return.  We follow Yohei's work day in Tokyo from morning until evening .Yohei works as the assistant manager at APA hotel Shinjuku Gyoenmae.  APA is one of the largest hotel chains in japan.  APA hotel uniquely identify as a New Urban style hotel high Quality, High Functionally without all the unnecessary services providing all guests with a good night’s sleep, often mistaken as a Japanese business hotel, which are typically budget style hotels close to the train station, originally intended for Japanese salarymen traveling between cities for business.  Often the rooms are smaller with bare amenities, single bed, desk, tv, refrigerator, unit bath and toilet.  In Japan, tipping is not customary and in some ways can be awkward as it’s unexpected.  It’s ingrained in Japanese culture to take pride in your work no matter at what level, so receiving a tip as an incentive to delivery the best service is viewed as unnecessary, all tying back to Omotenashi.<br /><br />The APA Hotel where I filmed (Shinjuku-Gyoenmae)<br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Q9fYLZ">https://bit.ly/2Q9fYLZ</a><br /><br />APA HOTELS &amp; RESORTS<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.apahotel.com/en">https://www.apahotel.com/en</a><br /><br />Get my Tokyo &amp; Japan Merch and show your support! <br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tokyozebra.com/mrch">https://tokyozebra.com/mrch</a><br /><br />--- Tokyo Zebra: My 2nd YouTube Channel ----<br />See My Life in Japan behind the scenes<br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/tokyozebra">https://www.youtube.com/tokyozebra</a><br /><br />Questions about Japan or Japan Travel?
