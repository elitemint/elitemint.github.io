So when taken at face value, this seems to suggest that you can accomplish everything by doing nothing. That doesn’t make much sense obviously. So Wu Wei is often translated more loosely as “effortless action” or “unforced action”, but I prefer the term “sincere action”. Everything, in my opinion, is achieved through sincere action.<br /><br />Right action comes from right understanding. Right understanding comes from learning. Learning comes from involvement in the world. Involvement comes from sincere action and feedback. And to act sincerely is to live without wei or, in other words, to live Wu Wei. And to live Wu Wei, is to allow the winds and currents to take you, and so by “doing nothing”, you accomplish everything.<br /><br />RELATED VIDEOS<br />_<br />Practical Philosophy Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5faAYlGYYoF7rgKH4oo_B81n4wE1n2xP">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5faAYlGYYoF7rgKH4oo_B81n4wE1n2xP</a><br /><br />GET MORE FREE CONTENT<br />—<br />Get Daily Thoughts on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/freedomintht">http://twitter.com/freedomintht</a><br />Get Daily Insights on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/freedomintht">http://instagram.com/freedomintht</a><br />Get Exclusive Essays in my Newsletter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://freedominthought.com/exclusives">http://freedominthought.com/exclusives</a><br /><br />FURTHER READING<br />—<br />Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/8Aupz">https://geni.us/8Aupz</a><br /><br />NOTES<br />—<br />(1) Videos are just my opinion, for entertainment and informational purposes.
