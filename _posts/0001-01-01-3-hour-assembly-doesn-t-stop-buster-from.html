{% raw %}Occurred on April 2020 / Darien, Connecticut, USA<br /><br />Buster, our 8 week-old HavaPoo was just put into a built playpen. The playpen was unassembled and I have two other puppies so sitting on the floor, putting it together was a challenge and it took about 3 hours to assemble. This is the video of me putting him in the pen for the first time. I did not account for the floor.<br /><br />Contact licensing@viralhog.com to license this or any ViralHog video.<br /><br />Make money from your videos!
