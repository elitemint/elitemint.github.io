{% raw %}Hey guys I wanted to post a more personal update to get it out of the way. Andrey and I are getting divorced. I delayed making a video for quite a while because I didn’t want to make a video about it. <br /><br />We’ve been separated off and on for 3 years. The entirety of our relationship was overrun with insane events. Absolutely horrific family sicknesses, business, an unplanned pregnancy, my own health struggles. It’s been rough to say the least. Given the last number of years, I think things turned out as well as they could have. <br /><br />In regards to Scarlett - we’re co-parenting as we have already been and things are as good as can be hoped now. Calm. We’ve all relocated to Nashville and Andrey and I are still co-parenting. <br /><br />I certainly didn’t want to grow up and get divorced. I don’t think anyone (particularly those with children) aim for that. There wasn’t an alternative and we looked for one for years. This wasn’t a spur of the moment decision. This is something I’ve spent years thinking about and more recently praying about and it was the right decision.  <br /><br />I thought you guys should know.{% endraw %}
