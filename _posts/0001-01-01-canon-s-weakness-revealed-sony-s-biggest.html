{% raw %}This is what all the weaknesses are for each camera brand.  Canon is amazing at certain things, but weak in certain areas.  Same with Sony, Fuji, Nikon, Panasonic, Olympus and Blackmagic.  These are the areas they need to work on to make the perfect camera. <br /><br />All my gear and recommended products can be found in my affiliate shop, thanks for shopping around! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/vegetablepolice">https://www.amazon.com/shop/vegetablepolice</a><br /><br />Patreon for Monthly Q&amp;A Videos <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/vegetablepolice">https://www.patreon.com/vegetablepolice</a><br />T-shirts and merch! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vegetablepolice.threadless.com/">https://vegetablepolice.threadless.com/</a><br />My Monkey Strength ebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://payhip.com/b/VyEG">https://payhip.com/b/VyEG</a><br />My Music from videos!
