{% raw %}Even though @Naughty Dog's standalone multiplayer project was not announced at this years  @PlayStation Showcase nor The Last of Us Day, there is still a dedicated community that continues to support The Last of Us Factions in 2021. Continuing my latest series of The Last of Us Tier Lists, today we're taking a look at all TEN purchasable weapons. I have RANKED these based off of the follow criteria: Damage, Fire-Rate, Ammo Cost, Loadout Cost, Armor Damage, Range, &amp; Style. I would LOVE to see your own LIST of the purchasable weapons tiers &amp; rankings in the comments below, don't be shy!<br /><br />Flamethrower Firefly photo captured by the talented Gumma Flores, be sure to check him out on YT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GummaFlores">https://www.youtube.com/c/GummaFlores</a> &amp; Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/gummaflores">https://www.twitch.tv/gummaflores</a> <br /><br />🌟 If you would like to support the growth of The Last of Us community and the production of videos like this, please consider becoming member of this channel by joining here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcpljwwbnYifCJALnn4atIQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcpljwwbnYifCJALnn4atIQ/join</a><br /><br />I hope you enjoyed the gameplay, and please feel free to comment with any questions you may have about this video, or TLOU in general.
