{% raw %}This time of year I'm usually targeting perch and pike with the weather cooling right down, but seeing as the conditions were still quite mild i decided to set my sights elsewhere. After a lure session on the river i decided to hop onto the canal. I had spotted a couple dark shapes while I was out pike fishing. On closer inspection I noticed that these were in fact carp! This was a busy Urban part of the canal not usually the place I'd like to sit and fish, but I only had a couple days before the temperature would dropped right off, so I knew I had to get on them asap. This is how I got on. Hope you enjoy. <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/the_ginger_fisherman/">https://www.instagram.com/the_ginger_fisherman/</a>{% endraw %}
