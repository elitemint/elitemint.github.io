{% raw %}A powerful combination of two traditional Christian Exorcism rites in Latin used to ward off and remove evil spirits, witch craft and dark energy. It's common for people to feel pain, burning, itching across parts of the body headaches, nasuea, diarrhea and also &quot;jolts&quot; and twitches as dark energy is cleansed and any attached entities removed while listening to these prayers. <br /><br />Unlike in Hollywood movies cleansing and removal of spirits and negative energy stored in the body does not happen instantaneously - it can take time. It is recommended to make listening to this prayer a regular practice over a prolonged period using headphones or leaving play in a room in the background for extended periods perhaps even whilst sleeping. Whilst you may notice discomfort when listening at first as energy is cleared you will notice any negative spiritual experiences you have been experienced will continually diminish over time. Eventually when you are clear of negative energy you will experience no pain or discomfort when listening to the prayers and restored vitality, clear thinking, healing and freedom from previous pain an ailments.  For faster action you can couple with fasting to allow your body to more effectively and efficiently clear the toxins released from the negative energy being cleared. Also abstaining from any sinful or immoral behaviours is essential - whilst we should always strive for this it is especially important during the cleansing and clearing process to ensure as you are clearing you are not simply re-adding what you have removed. <br /><br />The video contains St Benedicts Cross Latin excoricism prayer - 'Crux sacra sit mihi lux - Vade retro Satana! This prayer is one of the oldest known exorcism prayers in the Christian tradition and is linked to St Benedict and his medal (Shown in background picture). The medal and prayer linked to it are one of the oldest and most honored prayers against evil so much so the medal is also known as the &quot;devil-chasing medal&quot;. St Benedict was renowned as having power over evil and the ability to destroy poisons and toxins. <br /><br />The medal is inscribed with the words from the Latin prayer chanted during this video. On the arms of the cross are the initial letters of a rhythmic Latin prayer: Crux sacra sit mihi lux! Nunquam draco sit mihi dux! (May the holy cross be my light! May the dragon never be my guide!).<br /><br />In the angles of the cross, the letters C S P B stand for Crux Sancti Patris Benedicti (The cross of our holy father Benedict).<br /><br />Above the cross is the word pax (peace), that has been a Benedictine motto for centuries. Around the margin of the back of the medal, the letters V R S N S M V - S M Q L I V B are the initial letters of the second Latin verse of the prayer of exorcism against Satan: 'Vade retro Satana! Nunquam suade mihi vana! Sunt mala quae libas. Ipse venena bibas!' (Begone Satan! Never tempt me with your vanities! What you offer me is evil. Drink the poison yourself!)<br /><br />During a trial For witchcraft at Natternberg near the Abbey of Metten In Bavaria In the year 1647, the accused witches testified that they had no power over Metten Abbey, which was under the protection of the bendict cross. Upon investigation, a number of painted crosses, surrounded by the letters which are now found on Benedictine medals, were found on the walls of the abbey, but at this time their meaning had been forgotten. Finally, In an old manuscript, written In 1415, was found a picture representing St. Benedict holding in one hand a staff which ends In a cross, And a scroll In the other. On the staff And scroll were written In full the words of which the mysterious letters were the initials - the Latin excorcism prayer chanted in this video. Medals bearing the image of St. Benedict, a cross, and these letters began to be struck In Germany, and soon spread over Europe. They were first approved by Benedict XIV In his briefs of 23 December, 1741, And 12 March, 1742. <br /><br />Additionally overlayed with this prayer is a catholic Exorcism Rite performed by Fr. Arellano. The Latin Prayer used for the excorcism right is as descibed on the Roman Catholic right of Excorcism - &quot;RITUALE ROMANUM DE EXORCISMIS ET SUPPLICATIONIBUS QUIBUSDAM&quot;.{% endraw %}
