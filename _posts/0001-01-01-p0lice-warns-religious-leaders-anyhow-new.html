{% raw %}Saying My YouTube GoodBye<br /><br />Firstly, let me thank all who have supported me in this journey of YouTubing. I can’t lie, it’s not moi-moi but reading comments from those of you who “get me” and value my contributions through this platform has been part of the petrol that kept the fire in me burning.<br /><br />Even when I stopped posting in the past, it was some of you that come to my email and inbox to literally drag me back here 😂<br /> <br />Thank you to all of you who even when you disagree with me you sometimes, you always bear in my that I always say, ‘This is my opinion, feel free to share your own opinions in the comment section”.<br />Like I always say, ‘I don’t know it all, it’s the one I know that I’m sharing’ <br /><br />For those always asking, <br />“Summer, How Can I be Successful On YouTube?”<br />I don’t know your definition of “Successful On YouTube” but I can tell you how to enjoy creating content on YouTube.<br />1). Find your corner, 2). take it and 3). own it. <br />Don’t let anyone/anything shake you.<br /><br />On YouTube I noticed that:<br />…. When I share my story of poverty and picking from bins while growing up, some people said I have no shame; that I’m disgracing myself on YouTube.<br />…. When I shared about growing up in house were my parents fought and how that traumatised me, some people said I’m disgracing my family.<br />…. When I shared my marriage story, some people said I’m washing my dirty linen in public.<br />…. When I shared other people’s marriage stories (ie celebrities), some people said “stop using other people’s story for content.<br />…. When I shared “How I take back yard enter Obodo Oyinbo”, some people said I’m shameless.<br />…. When I share about what some pastors are doing or teaching that’s not in the Bible, some people said, touch not my anointed”. <br />…. When I shared about other YouTubers story that’s going round, some people said, you’re jealous of other YouTubers <br />…. When I shared a small house I was living in that was mice infected, some people said, look at where she’s living and they laughed at my house.<br />…. When I shared my big house and how God has been good to me, some said I’m showing off.<br />…. So you see?. No matter what you do on this YouTube some people will run kiti kiti and run kata kata, them no go let you drink water drop cup.<br />But if you stay focused on your lovers NOT your haters you will be fine.<br /><br />I have so much I’d like the write but I don’t want this to be too long. I’ll end with the few important messages,<br /><br />To my fellow Christians:<br />Open your Bibles, study to know God for yourselves.<br />DON’T leave your brains behind when entering a church.<br />Because if you don’t use your brain them go use am for you oo.<br />DON’T follow anyone blindly make you no go lost oo<br />You hear?! <br /><br />To women:<br />Please don’t ever think that all you can contribute in life is gossip, having babies and cooking.<br />No one on this platform cooks more or better (in my opinion) than our big sister @Flo Chinyere. But she has also shown us how she goes to work at sea for months, we have seen how she has basically been an architect, a builder etc<br />Gone are the days when men sat at the village centre discussing ways to better our world, while some women with the brightest ideas burnt them away with firewood in the kitchen because society thought women were not good enough. Women are more than just popping out babies. Let’s know better, do better and teach our daughters better.<br /><br />To men:<br />Cough-Cough (clear my throat)<br />I know some of you think I hate men. That’s where you’re wrong 😀<br />The thing is that unfortunately, so much has happened for centuries that at this point women are doing catch up. That’s why it may look like I’m only speaking for women. We’re just trying to balance things up a bit🤪.<br />We not hate una; na the injustice wey don dey happen to women for long-long time we hate and dey try to correct.<br />Make una no vex. We love una die. My fellow women here can testify to that. In fact we too love una sef. <br />Una hear? <br /><br />To all our new YouTubers:<br />Welcome to YouTube. This is such a powerful avenue to do amazing things. The strategy is simple<br />1). Find your corner, 2). take it and 3). own it.<br />That’s what I did and I’m glad I did.<br /><br />Thank You All<br />Your one and only Aunty In The Lord<br />❤️ Summer Aku{% endraw %}
