{% raw %}Hey guys, today I am  going to talk to you about Owning a Standard Poodle! <br />The Standard poodle is the largest size that a poodle comes in and they will end up weighing about 60 to 80 lbs. They are considered large breed dogs! <br />The poodle comes in 3 sizes: Standard, Miniature and the smallest is called a Toy poodle. <br /><br />The Poodles original origin is disputed from being from Germany or from the French Barbet. <br />1) The Standard Poodle is ranked the 2nd most intelligent dog breed right behind the Border Collie. <br />2) They are ranked the 7th most popular dog breed in the United States. <br />3) They are the most hypoallergenic dog breed with a single coat layer that does not shed. <br />4) The Poodle has been a breed present in Europe for centuries. Drawings by German Artist “Albrecht Durer” established the popular image of the breed in the 15th and 16th centuries where a poodle was seen in his artwork. And further appearances of poodles in artwork were recorded by Rembrandt in a self portrait he created in 1631, with his pet poodle in the foreground. This breed was viewed as royalty and found in portraits with kings and queens. <br />5) Poodles have always been shown in competition since dog shows were invented in the 19th Century! <br />6) The Standard poodle is known for being fabulous with their Elegant body stature and always seen at dog shows winning Best in Show. <br />7) The Standard poodle is skillful in many dog sports including agility, duck hunting, obedience, tracking, herding, circus performance, and assistance dogs.  <br />8) Poodles hair coats come in multiple colors such as white, cream, apricot, black, silver, phantom and pari-colored. <br />9) Poodles temperaments are known for being quiet and reserved and even alittle aloof with strangers.  A poodle should not be aggressive and this is considered a serious fault in the breed. Though not suitable as a guard dog since they are neither a territorial breed not aggressive, a poodle will still protect its masters family and children if serious danger is near. <br />10) Standard Poodles have way less health issues than your smaller poodles. Their main Health issue is ear infections since they have an exuberant amount of ear hair that grows in their ears and traps moisture leading to yeast and bacterial infections. <br />11) Hygiene and upkeep of a poodle is simply grooming them once a month to help keep their hair coat short and manageable. Sophie is a puppy and right now I give her baths when she gets dirty and blow dry her out which takes me about 20 minutes. She will soon go to the groomer to get full body clippings about every 6 weeks. Each grooming costs about 45$ from an expert groomer. <br /><br />Thank you for watching this video on owning a poodle! <br />Please share this video with a friend who wants to get a poodle or who may have just got one! :) <br />~ Dr. Lindsay Butzer{% endraw %}
