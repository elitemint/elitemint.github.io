{% raw %}Hey guys, Hope you guys doing well. Today, I made Mercedes-Benz Smart key fob case. Using this method, you can make a simple wet formed molding case without special power tools. It's a really fun job, so I hope you enjoy this video as much as I had fun making it. <br /><br />► LEATHER<br />Art.Buttero 1.6mm (4oz)<br /><br />#leathercraft #Mercedes-Benz #keyfobcase<br /><br />Ⓒ 2021 Hahns Atelier.
