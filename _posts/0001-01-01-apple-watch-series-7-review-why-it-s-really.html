{% raw %}The Apple Watch Series 7 brings a couple features to the best smartwatch in the world. Starting with two new watch faces. Countour, which is inspired by mid century watch design, the numbers on the dial bleed to the edge of the display and Modular Duo which is the first watch face to include two large complications. Fast charging is here, 33% faster than series 6. Itâ€™s also got a larger display which makes it a huge jump from Apple Watch Series 3 and big jump from Apple Watch Series 6. This allows the all new keyboard which works surprisingly well. Buttons, apps in home screen, calculator, passcode and more are so much larger. We also get a brighter always on display, crack resistant glass, dust resistant body and waterproof. Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s new but in the video, I show you how the Apple Watch is extremely useful in my daily life. What is the point of an Apple Watch? Why do you need an Apple Watch is the real question? Starting with health and fitness with itâ€™s activity app which motivates me to move more. The goal each day is to close the rings; move, exercise and stand. It also allows me to track my workouts with the workout app, from swimming, yoga and of course running. Thereâ€™s something really magic on working out with your Apple Watch. If you have AirPods, itâ€™s an experience like no other. You donâ€™t need to bring your iPhone with you to listen to music since you can stream 75 million of songs right on your wrist is super powerful. And simply the fact that the Apple Watch has cellular, there is not need to bring your iPhone, since you can answer calls and reply to text messages wherefore you want. There is also the mindfulness apps which allows you to take breathing sessions with breathe and reflect. There are so many sensors on Apple Watch Series 7, that allow you to take an ECG, receive heart rate notifications, blood oxygen tracking, fall detection, and more. But by far my favourite feature is that way that it keeps me connected with my loved ones. Messages, phone calls, HomeKit, maps, Wallet and your boarding pass when traveling. I could just keep on going. <br /><br />So? Is it worth the upgrade? Letâ€™s find out. <br /><br />ðŸ’¦ Download WaterMinder here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waterminder/id653031147">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waterminder/id653031147</a><br /><br />#AppleWatchSeries7Review<br /><br />Instagram:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/nikiasmolina/">https://www.instagram.com/nikiasmolina/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/NikiasMolina">https://twitter.com/NikiasMolina</a><br />ï£¿MUSIC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/profile/NikiasMolina">https://itunes.apple.com/profile/NikiasMolina</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0pgv15ZNBKlvVv7akVbETu">https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0pgv15ZNBKlvVv7akVbETu</a><br /><br />TIME STAMPS<br />00:00 Nikias Molina presents<br />00:38 So Personal<br />01:08 New Features<br />01:11 New Watch Faces<br />01:23 Fast Charging<br />01:31 Larger Display<br />01:42 Keyboard<br />02:01 Always on Display<br />02:01 More Durable<br />02:15 Underwater<br />02:48 Cycling Away<br />03:28 Activity Rings<br />03:39 For Everybody<br />04:02 What is the Move Ring<br />04:06 What is the Exercise Ring<br />04:15 What is the Stand Ring<br />04:21 Walking Apple the Dog<br />04:30 Playing Ping Pong<br />04:40 Workout App<br />04:47 Running with Apple Watch<br />05:12 AirPods + Apple Watch<br />05:35 Mindfulness<br />06:00 Breathe<br />06:07 Reflect<br />06:22 WaterMinder<br />07:04 Health<br />07:16 ECG<br />07:35 Heart Rate Notifications<br />07:44 Blood Oxygen Tracking<br />07:47 Fall Detection <br />07:51 Connected<br />08:28 Grandpa<br />09:12 Phone Calls<br />09:18 HomeKit<br />09:26 Siri<br />09:35 Traveling with Apple Watch<br />09:44 Apple Pay<br />10:43 Customisable<br />11:00 Apple Watch Bands<br />11:05 Alarm<br />11:15 Worth it?<br />12:29 Thank you for watching{% endraw %}
