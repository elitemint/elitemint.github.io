It's a land of extinct volcanoes surrounded by the Irish Sea, a spellbinding landscape whose peaks are some of the most ancient on the planet and whose valleys are a refuge for rare and fascinating wildlife including otters, hen harriers and peregrine falcons. This film follows a farmer, a National Park warden, a climber and a poet throughout the year and, through their intimate knowledge of Snowdonia, explores the nature of wilderness in modern Britain.<br /><br />About BBC Earth: <br />The world is an amazing place full of stories, beauty and natural wonder.
