{% raw %}All Class was the focus of attention at Punchestown after landing a gamble in a race described afterwards as a “complete farce” by winning trainer Ronan McNally.<br /><br />Available at as big as 13-2 in the morning for the William Hill Ireland Pick Your Places Handicap Chase, the six-year-old opened at 4-1 and was backed into 13-8 favouritism in a 16-runner field.<br /><br />Front-running Rudy Catrail crashed out at the first leaving the 13-year-old Capture The Dream clear, with the only one to pay him any respect being Donagh Meyler on the eventual winner.<br /><br />“It was just about getting round today and seeing where we were at. She did it really well, but I wouldn’t read too much into that race as it was a complete farce,&quot; said McNally.<br /><br />The stewards held an inquiry and interviewed all jockeys bar the first two home and the riders of the two fallers at the first fence.<br /><br />Niall Cronin, communications director of the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, said: “The riders felt that the early fallers contributed to them getting so strung out early on and that they went very quick for the type of race it was. The stewards noted their explanations.”<br /><br />#RacingTV #HorseRacing #Punchestown #Stewards<br /><br />This is the official YouTube channel of Racing TV.<br /> <br />Racing TV is the UK's leading horse racing channel showing live racing from the best racecourses in Great Britain and Ireland.<br /> <br />Subscribe to Racing TV's free YouTube channel and get closer to the sport we all love.
