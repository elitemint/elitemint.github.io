{% raw %}An indepth study of Moses 1 and Abraham 3, which tell of Moses' epiphanies and Abraham's astronomy/theology lesson. This lesson focuses on proving the contraries of &quot;the Infinite&quot; and &quot;the Intimate&quot; when it comes to God, and &quot;Dust&quot; and &quot;Divinity&quot; when it comes to ourselves; overcoming the adversary; focusing on what matters most; the &quot;orbits&quot; of stars and souls; the premortal plan; and more.
