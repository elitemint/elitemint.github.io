{% raw %}Hi guys! In this video I will tell you about my two-month stay in Moscow. It was my second time visiting the capital but the first time when I actually lived there as a local. Some things in Moscow are completely different from Khabarovsk. For example, the well-developed metro system, supermarket chains with unfamiliar names like Pyaterochka or Dixi, convenient services and the fast pace of life. During my stay there, I visited a lot of famous places, such as the Red Square, Old Arbat, Izmailovo Kremlin, as well as Moscow clubs and bars. Thanks to my fellow YouTubers for showing around!<br /><br />Overall, I really liked my time in Moscow and I hope to return here soon. Thanks for watching the video, and I can't wait to show you other videos about my adventures!<br /><br />Subscribe to @Zangieff  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Zangieff">https://www.youtube.com/c/Zangieff</a><br /><br />Subscribe to @Dari Step <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DariStep">https://www.youtube.com/c/DariStep</a><br /><br />Yeah Russia on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/yeahrussia/">https://www.instagram.com/yeahrussia/</a><br /><br />Support me on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/yeahrussia">https://www.patreon.com/yeahrussia</a><br /><br />Timecodes:<br />0:00 intro, why I came to Moscow<br />0:52 Red Square, weird statue &amp; Old Arbat w/ Zangieff<br />5:39 my luxury apartment &amp; neighborhood<br />8:39 bar hopping w/ Dari Step<br />11:18 afterparty reflections on the big city life<br />13:25 exploring Kitay-Gorod district w/ Dari Step<br />16:27 creepy story about me being stalked<br /><br />ðŸŽµ Music from the video: Circle of Ours - Justnormal<br /><br />*About myself* <br />Hi!
