{% raw %}When Tesla released its groundbreaking Roaster, it was the first time an automobile<br />company used a Lithium-ion battery in a production electric vehicle. While the company<br />has made many improvements to its battery in subsequent models, it wanted something<br />more and embarked on the radical 4680 battery. Now that Tesla's INSANE new 4680<br />battery is finally here, what makes it beat other batteries hands down?<br />Join us as we explore Tesla's insane new 4680 battery!<br />The battery is one of the most crucial components in an electric vehicle. Without it, the<br />car is not moving an inch! Apart from providing the energy to move the tires, the battery<br />basically determines the price in the budget to mid-range priced electric vehicles. It also<br />determines the car's weight, as it could be up to one-third of the curb weight!<br />Also importantly, if the battery is not well made, it could be a potential fire risk and<br />trigger massive recalls after buyers have started, as it has put GM in an unenviable<br />position with its Bolt EVs.<br />But more importantly, the battery determines how far you can drive before you need to<br />stop for a charge. With charging infrastructure still in its infancy in most places, the<br />battery could make or break an electric vehicle!<br />This is why Tesla pays so much attention to its batteries. It has some of the most<br />extended ranges in cars in the industry. For example, the Model S Long Range has a<br />range of 405 miles, as certified by the EPA!<br />While having Superchargers all over the place can help reduce or alleviate range<br />anxiety,   Tesla   chose   to   tackle   the   battery   itself   and   made   astounding   all-around<br />improvements. And that was how the insane new 4680 battery was born!<br />Tesla spends a lot of money and human resources on its battery, which shows in the<br />new battery!<br />The automotive world went into a frenzy on Tesla's Battery Day in 2021 when Musk<br />took to the stage to take the wraps off the new 4680 battery. The list of improvements<br />was as long as an arm.<br />Part of Tesla's roadmap is sustaining a 40 to 50 percent growth year on year, with calls<br />for a rapidly rising supply of batteries. With the 4680 battery, Tesla has plugged any<br />deficit in what its battery suppliers can bring and its increasing battery needs. This will<br />allow Tesla to maintain its leading position in the electric automobile world.<br />Interestingly, Tesla did not begin the design of the battery from the chemistry itself.<br />Instead, in a reflection of Musk's obsession with first principle thinking, the team looked<br />at the lowest common denominator, which in this case was the simplest truth anchoring<br />the battery to the mineral it was comprised of. After this had been defined and refined<br />repeatedly, the team was able to build an optimized design!<br />Tesla's journey to designing the 4680 battery included snapping up battery pioneers<br />from Maxwell Technologies and Hibar Systems. Its experience building its first battery<br />plant in Nevada also helped because it acquired manufacturing equipment experts at<br />Grohmann Automation.<br />As the most vertically integrated auto company globally, Tesla's aim from the get-go<br />was to eliminate inefficiencies and improve the sustainability of the process it would use<br />to make the batteries. This motivation influenced many aspects of the battery.<br />For example, the 4680 uses an architecture that eliminates tabs from the design, which<br />is why the new battery is also called Tabless. This single step has several significant<br />impacts on the production of the battery. For one, the battery production line does not<br />have to pause to add the tabs, which means manufacturing takes place faster!<br />Eliminating the tab also removes a potential source of a manufacturing defect as there<br />is no need to weld any components together. So Tesla's plant will churn out the 4680<br />battery cells at a fast clip without worrying about a defect!<br />Tesla's project Roadrunner established a pilot line for the new battery at its Kato Road<br />facility in Fremont, California, where it worked out the kinks in the production lines.<br />Compared to other batteries, the cylindrical 4680 cell is a jumbo pack, with a diameter<br />of 46 mm and a height of 80 mm, which is where the name derived from. This larger<br />jelly roll packs more active battery materials into the case. Tesla reckons this increase<br />in active content alone results in five times improvement in energy storage and six times<br />increase in power!<br />When the new cells are packed into an existing 2170 battery pack, it netted a 16<br />percent increase in range! Remember the tab Tesla eliminated? That step has another<br />amazing effect as it makes it easier and faster for electrons to move from place to place<br />inside the cell!<br />Digging into the chemistry of the 4680 battery, Tesla also made some changes in the<br />components. Tesla found a way to increase the amount of silicon in the battery by<br />starting with the raw silicon, which cut the cost by 5 percent and increased the range by<br />20 percent!{% endraw %}
