{% raw %}In today’s session, we will take a look on the newly China’s J-35 Carrier Fighter, does it a step to the most powerful navy? To answer this question, stay tune at this channel! <br /><br />China’s Navy has taken another step toward erasing the last advantages that the US Navy enjoys, in the form of the new, stealthy carrier fighter aircraft known as the J-35. It is a fighter jet that China’s military once considered a white elephant appears to have finally secured a role as the country’s newest carrier fighter.<br /><br />Prior to the introduction of the J-35, the backbone of China’s air force was the J-15 fighter. The J-15 is a reverse-engineered Chinese copy of the Russian Sukhoi Su-33, a fourth-generation fighter which has been thoroughly surpassed by U.S. planes such as the F-22 and F-35. <br /><br />In fact, the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation has existed as an actual flying platform since 2011, after which it progressed through three major design iterations and several designators (F-60/J-31/ and FC-31) before resurfacing as the J-35 aircraft which features a redesigned wing and an elongated fuselage optimised for a lower radar cross section (RCS).<br /><br />The J-35’s first public appearance was as the J-31 at the 2014 Air Show China expo. This model was fitted with two underpowered Russian-made engines originally developed for the Mikoyan MiG-29. <br /><br />All content on Military TV is presented for educational purposes.<br /><br />Subscribe Now : <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0IlEuu4TA9wq1u60tLMqBw?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0IlEuu4TA9wq1u60tLMqBw?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MilitaryTV.Channel">https://www.facebook.com/MilitaryTV.Channel</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://defense-tv.com/">http://defense-tv.com/</a>{% endraw %}
