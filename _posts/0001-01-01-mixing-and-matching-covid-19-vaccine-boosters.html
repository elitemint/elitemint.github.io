{% raw %}The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have approved the mixing and matching of COVID-19 vaccine boosters. That means you don’t have to pick the same brand for your booster shot as you got for your first round of COVID-19 vaccination. Learn more about mixing and matching in this video with Cindy Williams, Vice President of Pharmacy with Riverside Health System. <br /><br />-Follow us-<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.riversideonline.com">http://www.riversideonline.com</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/riversidehealth">https://www.facebook.com/riversidehealth</a><br />​Instagram: @RiversideHealth<br />Twitter @RiversideHealth{% endraw %}
