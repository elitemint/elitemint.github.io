{% raw %}Protect Yourself Rules - Grades K-3 - Lessons: 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3, 4<br /><br />The nonprofit Barbara Sinatra Children’s Center Foundation in conjunction with Wonder Media has developed a national campaign on a child abuse awareness and prevention.<br /><br />The program’s main goal is to educate children about what to do when confronted with abusive behavior, safe and unsafe touches, going to a parent or another trusted adult if they are confronted in an unsafe situation, and that it is not their fault. An “Unsafe Touch” is defined as touching private parts of the body that are covered by a bathing suit. Stranger safety, Internet safety and other situations are also presented.<br /><br />The program has been developed and scripted by child advocates, therapists, and national scholars and tested at various stages of development with students, teachers, school administrators, parents, and experts in the field of child abuse.{% endraw %}
