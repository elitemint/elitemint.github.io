He has performed more than 300 #Ashtavadhanams, 10 #Shathavadhanams and one #Mahasahsaravadhanam (first of its kind in the #Literary History of Andhra). His succesful completion of the #Sahasravadhana is a mile stone both in the life of Sri Garikipati Narasimha Rao and in the field of #Avadhana. That he could recite 1116 stanzas with ease and felicity surprised the audience and Sri Narasimha Rao got recognition as an unparalleled monarch in the realm of Avadhana. At a time ‘DHARANA’ of 750 poems is a record, till this date in the field of Avadhana. Then he was awarded the Title of ‘DHARANA BRAHMA RAKSHASA’.  <br /><br />Another feather in the cap of Sri Narasimha Rao in his #olyimpian #memory. He successfully recited 1116 stanzas of his own writing #SAGARAGHOSHA with perfect ease in 8 Hours twice at 2 different venues. This feat is as astounding as it is unheard of in the Histroy of Telugu Literatue. It is a world record and unbroken till this date. Apart from Sagaraghosha he has published 17 books which are quite popular in Telugu states. <br /><br />He has delivered hundreds of lectures across the Globe. His TV shows are all memorable and highly successful. Especially, the program #AndhraMahaBharatham, telecasted on #BhaktiTV for 1818 Episodes was a classic and was widely regarded as one of the best TV shows in Telugu. He was felicitated with the title, “PRAVACHANA KIREETI” on the completion of the show. Another prominent program is #NavaJeevanaVedam on #ABNAndhraJyothi .<br /><br />He was also felicitated with titles “SHATHAVADHANA GEESHPATHI”, “AVADHANA KALAPRAPURNA” at different occasions. He was also feliciated with many awards at International, National and State levels.  <br /><br />#SAGARAGHOSHA of Sri Narasimha Rao is unique #classical #poetry book in more than one sense. It may be described as a modern Telugu epic. Its speciality and uniqueness can be understood from the fact that its theme is totally different from other modern #TeluguKavyas . The life of man from the aborginal period to the modern ages froms the subject of this Kavya. In a way it is the story of #MotherEarth too. The publication of this #MagnumOpus of Sri Narasimha Rao is a land mark in the annuals of #TeluguLiterature . <br /><br />Sri Narasimha Rao is known for his rational approach to #spirituality. Unlike other speakers of his ilk who focus on one theme at a time, Sri Narasimha Rao is a multi – faceted personality. From #Sanskrit verses, this #Avadhani shifts to Telugu literature, touches upon #philosophy, moves over to #NationalisticPride and reaches the core subject with elan. <br /><br />As a no – nonsense speaker, Garikipati Narasimha Rao, through the hundreds of stage talks and telivision shows, has explained the #science behind various religious practices and advised the devout to shun the #BlindBeliefs that have no ratinale behind them. According to him, filling the hazy minds with #DivineKnowledge is possible only by clearing the insane and #superstitious thoughts. He puts his obective in a nutshell thus, “The larger goal of any #spiritualist is to achieve a #peaceful world where sanity prevails”.<br /><br />His mission is to make #youngsters aware of our #TeluguCulture, introduce them to #LiteraryWorks and epics and show them how one can imbibe the ideas of epics like #Mahabharatha and #Ramayana in our daily lives.{% endraw %}
