{% raw %}You may remember that I bought one hundred used and untested MD portables from Japan (shown in this video <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/FD_-vLoJ9EM">https://youtu.be/FD_-vLoJ9EM</a> ) I promised to make a follow up video showing how many I could get to work. Here it is. In this video I share a few tips as well as the odd lemon. <br /><br />--------------- SUBSCRIBE ------------------<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Techmoan?sub_confirmation=1">http://www.youtube.com/user/Techmoan?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />------------- Merchandise -----------------<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/techmoan-merch">https://teespring.com/stores/techmoan-merch</a><br /><br />------------- SUPPORT ---------------<br />This channel can be supported through Patreon <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/techmoan">https://www.patreon.com/techmoan</a><br />  <br />*******Patrons usually have early access to videos*******<br /><br />---------- Outro Music -----------<br />Over Time - Vibe Tracks <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/VSSswVZSgJw">https://youtu.be/VSSswVZSgJw</a><br /><br />------ Outro Sound Effect ------<br />ThatSFXGuy - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/5M3-ZV5-QDM">https://youtu.be/5M3-ZV5-QDM</a><br /><br />------ AFFILIATED LINKS/ADVERTISING NOTICE -------<br />All links are Affiliated where possible.<br />When you click on links to various merchants posted here and make a purchase, this can result in me earning a commission.

I'll show the first version of a video on Patreon and often the feedback I get results in a video going through further revisions to improve it.  e.g. Fix audio issues, clarify points, add extra footage or cut extraneous things out. The video that goes live on youtube is the final version.{% endraw %}
