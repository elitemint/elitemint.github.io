{% raw %}Coronavirus and the economic impact of the pandemic remain a threat to millions of lives around the world. People are still in need of lifesaving medical care, food and access to clean water. <br /> <br />Donations to the DEC Coronavirus Appeal have been helping those most vulnerable in eight countries, reaching people who lack access to medical care or clean water, and those whose livelihoods have been destroyed, leaving them unable to earn a living or buy food for their families. <br /> <br />DEC charities and their local partners are continuing to provide lifesaving aid but there is still so much more that needs to be done. <br /> <br />Please donate now.<br /> <br />Donate via: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dec.org.uk/appeal/coronavirus-appeal">https://www.dec.org.uk/appeal/coronavirus-appeal</a><br /><br />Follow the DEC for updates:<br /><br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DECcharity">https://www.youtube.com/user/DECcharity</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/DisastersEmergencyCommittee">https://www.facebook.com/DisastersEmergencyCommittee</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/decappeal">https://www.twitter.com/decappeal</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/disastersemergencycommittee">https://www.instagram.com/disastersemergencycommittee</a>{% endraw %}
