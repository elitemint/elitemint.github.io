{% raw %}It's been &quot;a mad world&quot; out there with record-high equities, real estate and more. But the long-awaited surge in gold and silver is coming in the next six months, said Mike Larson, senior analyst at Weiss Ratings.<br /><br />&quot;If you're in a world where many assets are over-valued, where real estate is extremely highly valued, stocks are extremely highly valued, and so on. What hasn't run up and remains relatively cheap? The biggest, most obvious answer to me is precious metals. And of course, the shares of the companies that mine them,&quot; Larson told Michelle Makori, editor-in-chief of Kitco News, on the sidelines of the New Orleans Investment Conference. <br /><br />What's been holding gold and silver back this year is the fear that the Federal Reserve will have to act aggressively and raise interest rates quickly in order to fight off inflation.  <br /><br />But that is not going to happen, according to Larson. &quot;There's going to be a realization in early 2022 that the Fed is not going to be able to be aggressive. People need to realize that this Fed is very tentative. It's a Fed that has a lot of political pressure to favor the employment side of its mandate over inflation.&quot;<br /><br />Follow Michelle Makori on Twitter: @MichelleMakori (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MichelleMakori)">https://twitter.com/MichelleMakori)</a><br />__________________________________________________________________<br />Kitco News is the world’s #1 source of metals market information.
