{% raw %}Yanis Varoufakis and Gilian Tett came to the Intelligence Squared stage in a conversation chaired by Anne McElvoy, to debate whether capitalism is broken and if it needs to be fixed. Tett and Varoufakis both agree that the current model of capitalism needs to change  but they differ radically in the solutions they proffer. <br /><br />Gillian Tett is the pioneering columnist who has spent the last decade documenting the rise of ‘conscious capitalism’, a movement led by businesses that have concluded they can no longer afford to ignore issues like climate change, income inequality and social justice. Yanis Varoufakis is the former Greek finance minister who oversaw the bailout crisis in 2015 and has spent the last decade calling for a kinder vision for the global economy.<br /><br />Is capitalism past its sell by date? Or can it be reinvented for the digital age?<br /><br />About Intelligence Squared: <br /><br />Intelligence Squared has established itself as the leading forum for live, agenda-setting debates, talks and discussions around the world.<br /><br />Our aim is to promote a global conversation that enables people to make informed decisions about the issues that matter, in the company of the world's greatest minds and orators.<br /><br />Click here to subscribe on Apple Podcasts and receive our audio podcasts as soon as they are released: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/3nKUHV4">https://apple.co/3nKUHV4</a><br /><br />Brilliant minds, debate, online events, ask your questions.
