{% raw %}I Was STALKED &amp; Nearly KILLED At Disneyland... Ever been to Disneyland? Stay tuned for three true horror Disneyland stories that will make you scared to death! Subscribe to Anna Horror Stories.<br /><br />When I was growing up I was lucky enough to live only a half hour away from Disneyland. Due to our close proximity and the fact that our whole family loved Disneyland, our parents always got us annual tickets every year. This meant that we got free parking and could go to the park as often as we wanted all year long. I have two twin brothers that are just a little bit older than me and they would take me to the park frequently. For the most part we would always stick together the whole time we were at the park. After all, it was a crowded place, I was young, and my parents would kill my brothers if they ever came home without me. <br /><br />But on one particular day, I really wanted to go to this art exhibit that was only going to be running at the park for a limited time only. It had vintage paintings of what the park looked like years ago. I was obsessed with art and had been dreaming of this exhibit since they first announced it weeks ago. My brothers, on the other hand, had no interest whatsoever and just wanted to go on the roller coasters. After lots of begging, I eventually persuaded them to let me go off on my own and meet up with them later. They told me exactly what time to meet them at Cinderellaâ€™s castle. I agreed, promised I would be there on time, and then took off on my own. <br /><br />The art exhibit was only about 15 minutes away from the entrance of the park but I wanted to stop and get a soft pretzel first. I found a concession stand and got in line. When it came time to pay, I was rummaging in my purse for the correct change and accidentally dropped a few coins on the ground. I bent down to pick them up but the person standing behind me did so before I could. I glanced at him and he was a middle aged man wearing dark clothes and a backwards baseball cap. He smiled at me before handing me the change I dropped. I thanked him, slightly embarrassed for my clumsiness. <br /><br />00:00 Intro<br />00:16 Story 1<br />08:23 Story 2<br />14:30 Story 3<br /><br /><br /><br />#annahorrorstories #disneylandhorror #halloween{% endraw %}
