From there things escalated and the pompous pair have grown their very mature and loving relationship ever since… <br /><br />They have been living the easy life staying with Lauren’s mum Sue ever since Brandan moved in completely unannounced. To the scourge of Sue and Brandan, self-proclaimed princess Lauren is quite the taskmaster. Ordering the pair about endlessly, she gets them to do everything from a 24/7 food and drinks service to carrying her around because she’s too lazy to walk. Sue Is getting tired and fed up so it’s time for this pushy princess and her not so prince charming to leave the hotel of mum and dad and get a taste of the real world.<br /><br />So for one week Brandan and Lauren have to leave the nest and try to make it on their own. Given the same amount of money they would have if they really did move out the couple need to find a flat as well as budgeting for bills, food and a dinner party for their parents. After all this they get to decide whether to move out permanently or return back to old comforts of home.<br /><br />Can their relationship survive all the stresses and pressures of adult life? And will Brandan’s sneaky test tactics push the relationship beyond repair?
