{% raw %}Reasons Why Most People Are Broke (Must Watch)<br /><br />If you have at least $400 saved to cover an unexpected emergency, you’re already financially better off  than one third of Americans, according to the Federal Reserve. It’s well known that most people do a poor job of managing their finances and there are seemingly few people that are responsible with their money.

This just means that you make responsible choices, aren’t making careless decisions on a regular basis and are comfortable with your income and expenses. What are some of the most common reasons that people are broke and how can you avoid them? Take a look so you can be sure you’re not making these mistakes that could keep you broke forever.{% endraw %}
