ENJOY! ◀️<br /><br />Use code BEAK and SUPPORT THE GANG! = Use creator code BEAK in the creator boost for any Supercell game! Find it in settings - more settings, and when you make any purchase in the game, it gives us a small reward, that we’ll use for gems, packs, and other ridiculous stuff in future videos!<br /><br />Beaker's Lab MERCH STORE!
