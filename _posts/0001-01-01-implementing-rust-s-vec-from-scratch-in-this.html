{% raw %}In this stream, we implement a limited version of Rust's Vec type from scratch. In doing so, we learn a lot about unsafe Rust. This stream is geared towards those with at least intermediate experience in Rust, but beginners should also learn more about how Rust's memory model works. <br /><br />Note: This is just a learning exercise! The standard library's Vec is great, and you should just use that.<br /><br />The resource on covariance I mention in the stream can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://github.com/sunshowers/lifetime-variance-example">https://github.com/sunshowers/lifetime-variance-example</a>{% endraw %}
