{% raw %}We bought a large piece of off-grid undeveloped land and we have some big plans for it. But first, I need to clear some land, build an access road, and build a campsite until we can get something more permanent built. If I am going to spend a lot of time off grid with my whole family of 5 I need to keep the kids entertained, so after I built the road and camp I built a homestead playground for the kids and they love it.
