It’s a great example of an evolutionary design that is unmistakably a Range Rover but also unmistakably new and fresh. <br /><br />Compared to the previous version, this design is all about taking out instead of adding in.<br /><br />More on the details of the design changes in a bit when we compare the old to the new in Photoshop. <br /><br />The 2022 Range Rover comes in 3 key configurations - a standard-wheelbase First Edition, an extended-wheelbase SV with a four-seat interior, and a seven-seater option.<br /><br />What about engine choices - Well you still have the 3.0L turbocharged inline-six with 48-volt hybrid assistance in the base SE and this puts out 395 horsepower and 406 pound-feet of torque.<br /><br />However Range Rover didn’t ditch the V8, you can have it with a brand new 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 making a massive 523 horsepower and 553 pound-feet of torque. This launches the Range Rover from 0-60mph in just 4.4 seconds.<br /><br />There will be a plug-in-hybrid six-cylinder for the 2023 model year and this makes 434 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque with a projected EV range of 62 miles from its 38.2-kWh battery. <br /><br />All-wheel drive is of course standard on the new Range however you can drive it as a rear wheel drive only now by disconnecting the front axle. This is still very much a great offroader with a ground clearance of an impressive 11.6 inches with the air suspension offering a maximum rise of 5.7 inches. <br /><br />You have 6 off-road driving modes available in the 2022 Range Rover and it can plow through 3 feet of water. <br /><br />You can order the 2022 Range Rover now with prices ranging from $105,350 for the SE to $164,850 for the long-wheelbase version.<br /><br />★Merchandise use code SKETCH10 at checkout for 10% off your first order: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thesketchmonkey.com">https://thesketchmonkey.com</a><br /><br />★My other channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/TheSketchMonkey">https://www.youtube.com/TheSketchMonkey</a><br /><br />★My online sketch course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://analogdesignerpropack.com">https://analogdesignerpropack.com</a><br /><br />★The books, art supplies and equipment I use: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/thesketchmonkey">https://www.amazon.com/shop/thesketchmonkey</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching!
