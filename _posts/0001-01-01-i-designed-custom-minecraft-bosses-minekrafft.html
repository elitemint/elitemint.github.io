I ended up making bosses for the forest, jungle, and nether biomes. They turned out really good! Sorry this video took so long to come out, we're working on some big things! And editing is starting to take a really long time. But soon I'll be back on a decent schedule so I hope you enjoy this one in the meantime (:<br /><br />//about<br />My name's daniel and I design things. Usually I do 3d modeling in blender but I'm now a metal worker thanks to mr beast apparently??? Who knows what I'll design in the future. If you have any ideas please let me know{% endraw %}
