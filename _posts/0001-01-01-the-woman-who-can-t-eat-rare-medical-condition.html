The 32-year-old weighs a mere 89lbs and cannot eat solid foods without suffering vomiting, severe pain or nausea. In 2013 Lisa was diagnosed with Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome (SMAS), a gastrovascular disorder that causes a pinching of her intestines making it hard to keep solid food down. She is one of only 400 documented cases worldwide. There is no cure for the condition, but Lisa continues to undergo corrective surgeries to make her life easier.Â <br /><br />To support Lisa please click the following link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.gofundme.com/LisaBrown">http://www.gofundme.com/LisaBrown</a><br /><br />Videographer / Director: Brad Podowski<br />Producer: Samantha Grillo, Nick Johnson<br />Editor: Sonia Estal<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to the Barcroft network:<br /><br />Barcroft TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/featured</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a><br />Bear Grylls Adventure: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzcUNwS7mypzPhW4gsjO7og/featured">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzcUNwS7mypzPhW4gsjO7og/featured</a><br /><br />For more of the amazing side of life:<br /><br />For the full story, visit BARCROFT.TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.barcroft.tv/">http://www.barcroft.tv/</a><br />Like BARCROFT TV on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.Facebook.com/BarcroftTV">https://www.Facebook.com/BarcroftTV</a><br />Follow @Barcroft_TV on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.Twitter.com/Barcroft_TV">https://www.Twitter.com/Barcroft_TV</a><br />Check out more videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/videos">https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/videos</a>{% endraw %}
