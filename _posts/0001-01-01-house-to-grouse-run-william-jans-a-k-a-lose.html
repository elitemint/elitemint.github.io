{% raw %}(A.K.A. Lose 4.5 pounds in 3 hours)... <br /><br />Every Canada Day (July 1), William has a foolhardy ritual of running from his home in Vancouver (Mount Pleasant area) to the top of nasty Grouse Mountain. <br /><br />The route is only 21.4 km but is mostly uphill. (*21.4 km = 13.4 miles = 12,597 Smoots).<br /><br />if you want to see the newsletter that includes the fun story on the unit of measurement known as SMOOTS have a look at this link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.wrjphoto.com/20100701_newsletter_wide.html">http://www.wrjphoto.com/20100701_newsletter_wide.html</a>{% endraw %}
