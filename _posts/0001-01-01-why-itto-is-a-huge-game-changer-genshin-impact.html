{% raw %}Arataki Itto has become surprisingly popular following his official reveal on MihoYo's official Twitter account, and thus, the speculation as to his in-game viability has begun. But in this case, it's actually quite interesting to see the role that Itto is filling and what that'll mean for his power in game.
