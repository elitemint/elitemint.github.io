{% raw %}AltiSpace 2 by Igor Vasiliev (iMusicAlbum) is a sophisticated convolution reverb. It’s pretty fantastic. Read the full description below to hear of all the bells and whistles but in a nutshell:<br /><br />a) It contains impulse responses from tons of rare and vintage gear, with literally hundreds of presets<br />b) You can load your own impulse responses<br />c) It has advanced tweaking options which are missing from many convolution reverbs, including filtering, gating, ducking, modulation and more, allowing for pretty insane sound design. It even has a reverse mode and pitch effects. <br /><br />If watching in the first two days of release of this video you have a chance to win 3 copies of the app here in Youtube, 1 copy on Twitter, and 1 on Insta. All details are in the pinned Youtube comment. Good luck!<br /><br />App Store link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/app/altispace-2/id1580223509">https://apps.apple.com/app/altispace-2/id1580223509</a><br /><br />App description:<br /><br />AltiSpace is a convolution reverb app with advanced controls that<br />provides realistic sounding natural acoustic space or vintage reverb<br />devices for any track or mix.<br /><br />A convolution reverb takes a captured sample (called an impulse<br />response) from a real-world space or real hardware and uses this to<br />digitally simulate the reverberation of that space or device down to<br />the last detail and nuance. Because it is sampled, not synthesized,<br />convolution reverb is known for its stunning realism, and it is widely<br />considered to be the best type of reverb. However, unlike the more<br />common algorithmic reverbs, convolution reverbs usually does not have<br />much control over the reverberation process.<br /><br />But AltiSpace, in addition to the ability to load your own impulse<br />response files and a built-in library of the most interesting vintage<br />reverb device presets, has advanced settings such as EQ, gate,<br />ducking, modulation and more. You can change the original impulse<br />response parameters to something completely new and then save it as a<br />new preset.<br /><br />This app has an easy-to-use user interface, where all the main<br />controls are located on the single screen, and it is ready to use<br />right out of the box, even without additional settings. And at the<br />same time, you can easily change the parameters of the impulse<br />responses from the built-in library to create your own sound.<br /><br />Any audio sample can be used as an impulse response, making AltiSpace<br />also a great tool for creative sound design. Try to import a<br />percussion hit sample and use it for a dry synth stab. You will<br />immediately hear the difference.<br /><br />App features:<br /><br />Ability to import your own impulse response files.<br />Built-in library of presets from the most interesting hardware reverbs.<br />Convenient preset manager with the ability to group presets.<br />Presets can be marked as favorites for display in the favorites group.<br />Reverb can work with a stereo or mono input and convert it to stereo.<br />Add dynamic noise before reverb for a more natural sound.<br />The gate allows you to turn on the reverb when the threshold is exceeded.<br />The ducking allows you to turn off the reverb when the threshold is exceeded.<br />Sets the minimum reverb level for Gate and Ducking modes.<br />Equalizer with high and low cut filters in chain before or after reverb.<br />Changing the time (length) of the current impulse response.<br />Sets the pre-delay time of the signal before reverb.<br />Experimental feature to change the pitch of the impulse response.<br />Amplifying early or late reflections.<br />Adjusts the stereo image before the reverb.<br />Haas effect for adding stereo space to a mono signal.<br />Sets the depth and freq of modulation the signal before reverb.<br />Mixing dry / wet signal and adjusting the output level.<br />Input and output level meters.<br />Indicators of possible input clipping for standalone.<br />Prevents any output clipping for standalone.<br />Built-in full description of all controls.<br /><br />Demo:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBHxgjkGCoU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBHxgjkGCoU</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLNi9wHaGew">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLNi9wHaGew</a>{% endraw %}
