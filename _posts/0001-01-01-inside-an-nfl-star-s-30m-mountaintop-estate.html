{% raw %}Today Architectural Digest brings you to Calabasas, California and up into the Santa Monica Mountains for a tour of a $30 million estate built for former all-pro NFL linebacker Clay Matthews and his family. Casey Matthews designed the home in collaboration with Tracy Sonka Stultz of Sonka Stultz Design. With seven bedrooms and 11 bathrooms, the French provincial style mansion features an abundance of amenities spread across a spacious 14,000 square feet - including an 800-gallon aquarium. Coming into the grand front entryway, through to the breezy loggia off of the formal living and out to the pool, the Casey &amp; Clay Matthews Estate is striking in its grandeur while maintaining the charm and comforts of a family home.<br /><br /><br /><br />--<br /><br />Featuring: Rayni Williams &amp; Shana Tavangarian<br /><br />Directed by: Lily Rhodehamel<br /><br />Edited by: Alex Mechanik, Rachael Knight, &amp; Joseph Buccini <br /><br />Post Production Manager: Rachael Knight<br /><br />Associate Producer: Chase Lewis<br /><br />Production Manager: Trina DeMattei<br /><br />Production Coordinator: Andressa Pelachi<br /><br />Director of Photography: Carter Ross<br /><br />Camera Operator: Jon Corum<br /><br />Audio: Cassiano Periera<br /><br />Drone Operator: Colin Rich<br /><br />Production Assistant: Eric Bittencourt<br /><br />Covid Officer: Carla Nora<br /><br />Want even more AD?
