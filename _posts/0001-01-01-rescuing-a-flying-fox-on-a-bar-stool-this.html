{% raw %}Winghaüs is a young adult male Grey-Headed Flying-Fox who got himself stranded in the wilderness of the tourist strip in Barangaroo.  This area is the old docks area, and has been turned into a hub of bars, cafes and eateries for the tourists who do the harbour foreshore walks, which go on for many kilometres.  This is a particularly high-rise concrete jungle in this area with nothing to climb onto and no way to get out for any unwary batties who end up on the ground.  <br />I nearly always get lost in this area because it all looks the same and the city and tourist traffic is quite dense.  There are masses of places you can only get to by walking, which means you have to find somewhere to park, which is always a nightmare.  I just parked on the footpath here and decided it would have to be OK.  My car has a large Megabattie bat rescue sticker on the door and it wasn't far away from the venue.<br /><br />This little guy was hanging off a bar stool, just waiting for his beer to be served.  He got noticed by the local birds who did a few dive bombs until the barman managed to scare them off.  <br /><br />I can't see anything particularly wrong with Winghaüs, other than his penis was enlarged and flaccidly engorged (if that makes any sense), which usually indicates a spinal or pelvic injury.  However, it went down by the time I got him home.  I think he's probably mildly concussed but it's something I just have to wait and see how it turns out.<br />The carer says he looks like he's ready to hang and feed himself tonight.  He'll go in with Corollary, a boy who came in from Collaroy Plateau, who is still not doing fabulously even though xrays showed no spinal injuries on him.  <br /><br />Winghaüs was the name of the bar.{% endraw %}
