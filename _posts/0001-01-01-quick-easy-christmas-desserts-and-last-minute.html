{% raw %}Christmas recipes and last-minute decor ideas <br /><br />If you don’t have a Christmas tree, we will show how you can make it with an excellent recycling idea with plastic! Use plastic bottles and green scotch tape to create a super cute cactus-like tree and decorate it with Christmas ornaments! If you love making crafts with a glue gun, you will be happy to see the Christmas tree ornament crafts we made with it ;) For example, you can stick together pasta and create a cute decoration. Or you can stick together small wooden sticks and turn them into mini Christmas trees that can also be used as decorations ;) We will also make a huge disco ball out of foil. Do you want to make something special for your festive table? Use pancake dough, food dye, and cookie molds to create adorable mini pancakes for Christmas breakfast! Don’t forget to add coconut flakes and your favorite syrup on top. Keep watching to see lots of delicious recipes that’ll get you in the Christmas spirit and help you enjoy this wonderful time! <br /><br />TIMESTAMPS: <br />00:33 — Easy Christmas tree decor <br />01:32 — DIY disco ball <br />02:37 — Yummy Christmas desserts <br />04:40 — Edible Christmas decorations<br /><br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
