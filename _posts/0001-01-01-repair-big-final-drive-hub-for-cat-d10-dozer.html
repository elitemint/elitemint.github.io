{% raw %}In this video we need to repair a big final drive hub for a Caterpillar D10T Bulldozer. The duo cone seal area of the hub is worn out and needs to be modified and upgraded to suit a new duo cone seal ring (labyrinth seal). There are also two bolt holes in the flange that are damaged and need repair. So there is plenty of machining and drilling &amp; tapping to get this job done. First we set it up in our LZMT lathe using a 950mm face plate and 6MT heavy duty live centre before machining to spec. After the machining is complete we use our radial arm drill for drilling the bolt holes to suit the new duo cone ring. We then finish off the job by repairing the two bolt holes in the hub. First we bore out the holes with an annular cutter, then machine up sleeves and interference fit using a pull bolt system. We hope you enjoy this video from our machining workshop!<br /><br />In this video we are using:<br />- LZMT CW6280D Lathe <br />- Hafco ZX3050X16 Radial Arm Drill<br />- Hafco TM-1740G Lathe<br /><br />Join our channel:<br />We upload new videos every Friday at 5pm AEST!
