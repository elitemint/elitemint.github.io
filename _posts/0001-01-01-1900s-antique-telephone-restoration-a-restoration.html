{% raw %}A restoration of an early 1900s bridging telephone, produced by the Stromberg-Carlson Telephone Mfg. Co. (One of the earliest competitors in the telephone market). This particular style of the phone was often used for communication in rural areas, being described as “The Farmer’s Friend” in marketing campaigns for its extra power and ability to communicate over long lines with many phones. <br /><br />In our research, the serial number records aren't online, but this specific Model 112 telephone was produced around 1904 at the company’s new factory in Rochester New York. It originally sold at a price of $14.75 (The equivalent of $458.54 today!).<br /><br />The actual restoration was quite involved, requiring complete disassembly of all the phone’s components. This included rust removal, woodworking, nickel plating, repainting, sanding, and lots of polishing! Everything done was to restore the piece to its original condition, and preserve all its functionality.<br /><br />Thank you, Jack Ryan and all those involved at telephonecollectors.info for the preservation and scanning of the documents featured in (and used for) this video.<br /><br />Thanks for watching! <br />We hope you enjoy the video!
