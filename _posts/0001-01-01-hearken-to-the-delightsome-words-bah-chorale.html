{% raw %}Music composed and arranged by Tom Price. Lyrics are from the Bahá’í Sacred Verses:<br /><br />O MY BROTHER! Hearken to the delightsome words of My honeyed tongue, and quaff the stream of mystic holiness from My sugar-shedding lips. Sow the seeds of My divine wisdom in the pure soil of thy heart, and water them with the water of certitude, that the hyacinths of My knowledge and wisdom may spring up fresh and green in the sacred city of thy heart.<br /><br />The Hidden Words of Baháʼu'lláh, Persian #33<br /><br /><br />No copyright infringement intended.<br /><br />For information regarding the Bahá’í Faith, visit bahai.org.{% endraw %}
