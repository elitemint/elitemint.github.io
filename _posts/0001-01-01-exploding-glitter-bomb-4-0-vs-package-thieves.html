{% raw %}Merry Christmas ya filthy animals. If you want to learn the design fundamentals it takes to make something like the Glitter Bomb, enroll in my Creative Engineering course at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Monthly.com/MarkRober">https://Monthly.com/MarkRober</a> and I'll see you in class!<br /><br />Get the new Glitterbomb 4.0 tshirt here- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://markrober.store/products/glitterbomb-4-0-pop-art-graphic-tee">https://markrober.store/products/glitterbomb-4-0-pop-art-graphic-tee</a><br /><br />A big shout out to Protolabs for the quick-turn machined parts.

During this class, I'm going to share with you my entire creative engineering process from start to finish. You're going to follow along with me as I fully design and engineer 3 brand new builds from scratch... from how I come up the idea, all the way through bringing the final builds to life. The best part is, over the month, you'll follow along with me and my process, side by side, and you will leave the class with 3 original, creative builds of your own. This is the class I wish I had when I was starting out. It's designed to take your skills to make cool stuff to the next level, whether you're a beginner or a more experienced maker/engineer. The class officially starts in early Jan, and it will only run a few times per year, so claim your spot if you're interested! See you in class! Love, Mark<br /><br />NANLUX's lights were instrumental for filming with the robotic arm: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPlMuo9pHqmpjV0_aO9Xa5A">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPlMuo9pHqmpjV0_aO9Xa5A</a><br /><br />Thanks to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://a--design.com/">http://a--design.com/</a> for providing the lid stop plungers{% endraw %}
