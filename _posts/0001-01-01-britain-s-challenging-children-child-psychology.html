{% raw %}This film follows life inside 5 UK primary schools to uncover the enormous challenges faced by teachers dealing with violent and disruptive behaviour. 97 percent of teachers say they have to deal with disruptive pupils in their classroom â€“ pupils like Levi in Luton, who regularly has to storm out of class for fear that he might lose control; or Jordyn in Glasgow whose swearing and aggression frightens teachers and classmates alike.<br /><br />With remarkable results, we follow Levi, Jordyn and others as their schools reach out to both children and parents to address the roots of their behaviour.<br /><br />In Jordyn's school she benefits from a Nurture Group, a special room set up as a bridge between home and school, where the whole spectrum of behavours that form a barrier to learning, from complete withdrawal to outright aggression, can be addressed.<br /><br />And in Levi's school headteacher, Hilary Goddard puts into practice her &quot;whole brain behaviour management in the classroom&quot; to help both children, teachers and parents.<br /><br />Want to watch more full-length Documentaries? <br />Click here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1GOzpIu">http://bit.ly/1GOzpIu</a><br /><br />Follow us on Twitter for more - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/realstoriesdocs">https://twitter.com/realstoriesdocs</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/RealStoriesChannel">https://www.facebook.com/RealStoriesChannel</a><br />Instagram - @realstoriesdocs<br /><br />Content licensed from True Vision.
