{% raw %}Hey guys.  I hope you enjoy these quick snippets of some of my work. I've been taking pictures for years for the purpose of looking back at my work as I got older. So, Here is a mixture of photos and vids I found on the repair of a torn off hydraulic steering weldment for an IT-38 CAT Front End Loader. The photos are not as complete as I had hoped. But, If you've seen any of my other videos, you have most likely seen the way I do things so hopefully you can piece together the photos with how I get these things done. I added some text to explain a couple of photos just for kicks. Again, Thank you for the continued support. I really appreciate it.{% endraw %}
