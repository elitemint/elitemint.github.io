{% raw %}How does Media change your perception of culture?  Nowadays, because of social media the way we look at an image and receive a piece of information have changed.   <br /><br />Min is a Lehigh student ('16, '17G) who studied Sociology and Entrepreneurship as a member of the Eckardt Scholars Program. His senior thesis—as presented at the 2015 Eastern Sociological Society Conference in NYC—explores the effects of representations of race in pop culture through the lens of the hip-hop and basketball industries. Min will be working at Red Bull in Santa Monica, CA starting mid-July, where he will be envisioning and executing brand campaigns around music and culture. Min graduated from Lehigh in 2016 with departmental and university honors, and is now pursuing a number of self-directed projects at the intersection of media, business, and culture through the Presidential Scholarship. Min is also known for his passion for music and DJing, and performs regularly under his the alias 'minnit'.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
