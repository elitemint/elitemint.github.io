{% raw %}Asmongold designs a better WoW Patch 9.2 in 15 minutes than Blizzard could with all their time and money since World of Warcraft Shadowlands came out. Recently, we found out how LONG it takes to unlock flying in 9.2 Eternity's End through the new forced Mobile-game-like system full of Timegating, Cypher of the First Ones. Drawing has inspiration from World of Warcraft's past expansions and other successful MMOs such as Square Enix's Final Fantasy XIV and Amazon's New World. Asmongold easily finds ways to make flying fun to get, reimagine WoW's outdoor combat with other players and bring back the true feel of an MMORPG to World of Warcraft, essentially designing a better 9.2 Patch than what Blizzard was able to deliver in over a year.<br /><br />â–º Asmongold's Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/asmongold">https://www.twitch.tv/asmongold</a><br />â–º Asmongold's Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/asmongold">https://twitter.com/asmongold</a><br />â–º Asmongold's 2nd YT Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ZackRawrr">https://www.youtube.com/user/ZackRawrr</a><br />â–º Asmongold's Sub-Reddit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/</a><br /><br />Thank you all for watching!
