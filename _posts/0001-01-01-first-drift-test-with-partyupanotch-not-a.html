{% raw %}This video takes us to our first test with the Ecoboost Foxbody. The chassis feels tight and I feel as though we are on the right path. The steering is actually really nice, I think with a mechanical pump it could be a tick better, but I want to tune for this pump as it is much more ideal for this type of build. Unfortunately now we know (months later) why we had a catastrophic engine failure. It was due to voltage regulation. The alternator is PWM based and with the draw of the fans, PS pump, Fuel pumps, and everything, there wasn't enough correction in the tune. Simple fix, but this is what happens when you're one of the first people doing this.<br /><br />Big props to BC Racing NA for helping us out with this project and supplying ideal suspension solutions for all of my personal and competition cars.{% endraw %}
