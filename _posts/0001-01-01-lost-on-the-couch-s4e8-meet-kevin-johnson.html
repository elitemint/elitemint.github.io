I (David) have seen the show 7ish times all the way through and my friends (Audrey, Hassan, and Zola) have never seen it before!<br /><br />I have always wanted to show my friends the experience that is LOST, so I decided I'd stick a camera in their faces and see what they thought of it! I also, with their permission, want to share it with whoever might be interested in watching it again through their eyes. After all, that is the closest us Losties can ever get to watching it again for the first time. ;)<br /><br />I'm actually a musician and composer, NOT a video editor, so don't expect too much fancy editing, but I very much enjoy this as a hobby.<br /><br />I sincerely hope you all enjoy these as much as I enjoy making them! Reach out to me in the comments if you have any suggestions, hopes, dreams, theories, advice, whatever. But NO SPOILERS! <br /><br />Thank you and NAMASTE!<br />-David<br /><br />0:00 - Start<br />0:15 - Intro Discussion<br />4:43 - News Clip<br />5:11 - Follow Me On TikTok!<br />6:20 - Reaction<br />20:23 - Post-episode Discussion{% endraw %}
