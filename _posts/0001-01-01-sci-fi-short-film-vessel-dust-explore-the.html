It’s going well. Really well. The chemistry is palpable - there is never a dull moment, never a lull in conversation. These two seem perfect for each other. Thomas waxes poetic on T.S. Elliot’s prose, Lucy recites her favourite stanzas… They are the envy of every couple in the restaurant. But if these jealous couples just looked a little closer, beyond the big words and fancy clothes, they would find something very peculiar. Unbeknownst to each other and other restaurant patrons, Thomas and Lucy each sport a discreet earpiece. And, through their respective earpieces, these “passionate” and “soulful” “lovers’’ are being told exactly what to do and say...<br /><br />Yes, relationships are without a doubt exhausting and anxiety-provoking, but what if there were a service that could all but assure success on date night? And every date after that? VESSEL tracks Thomas and Lucy's relationship, from first day to the alter, taking viewers to an alternate reality, where some inhabitants submit themselves to an enigmatic “Operating Service” that controls the entirety of their romantic lives.<br /><br />&quot;Vessel&quot; Credits:<br />Directed by <br />Ethan Godel<br /><br />Written by <br />Filip Lee and Ethan Godel<br /><br />Produced by <br />Ryan Bobkin<br /><br />Director of Photography<br />Diego Guijarro<br /><br />Tim Blair as Tom<br />Kasi McAuley as Lucy<br />Joseph Anctil as Tom’s Operator<br />Veronica Baron as Lucy’s Operator <br /><br />David Disher as The Priest<br />Alan Godel as Man in Suit<br />Justine Riches as Sarah<br />Ethan Godel as Jim<br /><br />Original Score<br />Aaron Cheung<br /><br />Editor &amp; Visual Effects<br />Ethan Godel<br /><br />Colourist <br />Zach Silverstein<br /><br />Audio Post-Production<br />Alex Gluch<br /><br />Production Designer<br />Hannah Garcia<br /><br />On Set Sound Recording<br />Matt Collins<br />Alex Gluch<br />Ben Ramos-Salsberg<br /><br />1st Assistant Camera<br />Zach Silverstein<br /><br />2nd Assistant Camera<br />Maria Sartzetaki<br /><br />Gaffer<br />Robert Wharry<br /><br />Script Supervisor<br />Devin Coull<br /><br />Grips<br />Jake Pascoe<br />Rehan Pervaiz<br />Benjamin Summers<br />Andy Youn<br />Nikita Zhang<br /><br />Hair &amp; Makeup<br />Shuli Grosman-Gray<br /><br />Art Production Assistant<br />Chelsey Althea<br /><br />Wedding Guests<br />Devin Coull<br />Beverly Bobkin-English<br />Norm English<br />Shuli Grossman-Gray<br />Lisa Godel<br />Owen Godel<br />Leah Gugliotta<br />Josh Hendel<br />Alisa Kanda Kovac<br />Filip Lee <br /><br />Subscribe to the DUST Newsletter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://eepurl.com/gnTIbD">http://eepurl.com/gnTIbD</a><br />Subscribe to DUST on YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2aqc5vh">http://bit.ly/2aqc5vh</a><br /><br />#DUST #scifi #shortfilm <br /><br />About DUST:<br />DUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.
