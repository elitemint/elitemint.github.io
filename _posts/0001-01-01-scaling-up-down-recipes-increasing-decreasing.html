{% raw %}Hello everybody – I’ve been getting a lot of questions on scaling up/down recipe especially when it comes to using different sized pans for the genoise. Watch the video and the method is all in there!<br /><br />Here's the table that was mentioned in the video:<br />6inch: 1 (base)<br />7inch: 1.4x<br />8inch: 1.8x<br />9inch:  2.3x<br />10inch: 2.8x<br /><br />======================<br />★My Equipments★<br />Oven: UNOX Bakerlux Shop.Pro Convection oven<br />Handmixer: Luxel or Tornado Standmixer: KitchenAid 5 Qrt Bowl-Lift or Kenwood 7 Qrt (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3hSMblB)">https://amzn.to/3hSMblB)</a><br />Silicone Mat: Silpat(<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3CApmLt)">https://amzn.to/3CApmLt)</a> or Silpat equivalent(<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3hUyZwG)">https://amzn.to/3hUyZwG)</a> Perforated Silicone Mat (Mesh): Silpat<br />Hand Blender: Braun MQ 7035X (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3nWy3Mj)">https://amzn.to/3nWy3Mj)</a><br />Food Processor: Hanil (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2XNxWYg)">https://amzn.to/2XNxWYg)</a><br />Stand Blender: Vitamix QuietOne (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3nTtBxK)">https://amzn.to/3nTtBxK)</a> Infrared Thermometer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3hW52fS">https://amzn.to/3hW52fS</a><br />Leveling Bar: This is not the same levelling bar as the one I have used as I bought mine locally in Korea.

I’m Hanbit, professional pastry chef and CEO of Sugar Lane Baking Academy based in Seoul, Korea. Funny enough, my background had nothing to do with baking - far from it. I studied mathematics at university and then worked in finance, strategy consulting and IT. Then one day in 2018, I quit my job and enrolled at a pastry school. I have loved it ever since!<br /><br />As my story suggests, I really enjoy being a pastry chef and I am keen to share the joy of baking with as many people as possible. Baking can seem daunting at first but as long as you take it step-by-step anyone can do it - even someone with no baking background like myself managed to become a professional pastry chef!<br /><br />I'll try my best to include detailed explanations and tips in my recipes so that you will be able to bake amazing desserts. I aim to create videos that can be enjoyed by people at all levels - those who bake for fun as well as those who want to get more serious.<br /> <br />★Instagram★<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/sugarlane.korea">https://instagram.com/sugarlane.korea</a><br /><br />★슈가레인 베이킹 스튜디오 수강 문의★<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blog.naver.com/oasis8jd">https://blog.naver.com/oasis8jd</a><br /><br />#recipe #recipescaling #sugarlane #조한빛 #슈가레인{% endraw %}
