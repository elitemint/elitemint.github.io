We are all seeing how electricity and gas prices are skyrocketing. This is not a specific phenomenon occurring in a single country: it is something on a global scale.<br /><br />Suddenly, the demand for natural gas has skyrocketed... at the very same time that the supply has been dramatically reduced. This explains why prices have risen, creating a crisis that could have catastrophic consequences.<br /><br />The question is, where does this crisis come from, and what are the possible solutions? In this video we answer all these questions.{% endraw %}
