Is he lying? Well, in the end it is all up to you to decide…<br />Have a closer look again and then do not forget to let us know in the comments…<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/cJ1unGyDRcI?t=11">https://youtu.be/cJ1unGyDRcI?t=11</a> <br /><br />Our next clip went viral on the internet two years back when a man caught a brachiosaurus on camera..<br />The guy was with his family just enjoying the evening when he spotted something unusual around him… he took his camera out and started recording and that is when he saw a huge brachiosaurus having a walk…<br />It was quite far so the footage is not that clear but well… IT IS A DINOSAUR…<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/0juf3dss6ww">https://youtu.be/0juf3dss6ww</a> <br /><br />We all know the fact that dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles… <br />First take a look at this one…<br />Many people felt it was a fake when a gigantic alligator was recorded on camera strolling on a Florida golf course with all four legs extended. The video went viral almost instantly. But many  have been saying that this looked more like a Deinosuchus than a croc…<br />The creature’s so-called &quot;high walk,&quot; which was recorded on video, was one of the main reasons for its terrifying appearance. When gators are on the move, they are often considerably closer to the ground but deinosuchus walked like this one did…<br />So? What say? Is that a deinosuchus or a croc?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/HDkUmS3EeOU">https://youtu.be/HDkUmS3EeOU</a> <br />It was spotted by other people too at different times…<br />Have a look…<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/lqwD9-bM15c?t=82">https://youtu.be/lqwD9-bM15c?t=82</a> <br /><br />This one is the most real footage you will ever come across when searching about the chances of dinosaurs being real still…<br />When going somewhere on a highway the man spotted some weird creatures crossing the road and he was shocked to see what these animals were…<br />We can see two cars, one with the man recording it all and the other one opposite to it… both of them have stopped to let the little dinosaurs pass by and must be just as surprised as you and me are when witnessing this whole scene…<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/0vHpL8hDibQ?t=118">https://youtu.be/0vHpL8hDibQ?t=118</a> <br /><br />Just passing by a place on a very normal day these three people accidentally recorded something no one was supposed to…<br />A huge t-rex can be seen in the background… but the way they reacted to it… and the guy recording it all did not even take time to look at what was happening make it all seem fake to me…<br />He should have at least looked that way or reacted to it but he didn’t… It appeared like it was a normal routine for them to have a tyrannosaurus eat grass in their backyard…<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/UbijdU5Okq8">https://youtu.be/UbijdU5Okq8</a> <br /><br /><br />Famous for their speed and shrewd nature these raptors have perfected their skills when it comes to hiding…<br />I mean look at them…<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/4dbyX6OB5HA">https://youtu.be/4dbyX6OB5HA</a>{% endraw %}
