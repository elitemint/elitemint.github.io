{% raw %}Many schools continue to separate the academic curriculum from extra-curricular activities, which are generally optional and after school. In this talk, Ambre suggests that some of the most essential learning experiences are happening outside the conventional classroom. Given the power and authenticity of those learning experiences, should robotics and similar programs be more central to education?<br /><br />Ambre (12th grade), whose roots are from Canada and France, moved from Switzerland to Prague less than three years ago. In addition to her passion for philosophy and natural science, Ambre has become one of the most active members of the robotics club at the International School of Prague. The ISP student team she was part of achieved outstanding results in the European regional competition and advanced to the world championships in the US in the spring of 2016.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
