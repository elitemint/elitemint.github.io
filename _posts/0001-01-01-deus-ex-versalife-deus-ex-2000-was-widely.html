{% raw %}Deus Ex (2000) was widely praised for its melodious and ambient music which incorporates a number of genres, such as classical, jazz, and techno. <br /><br /><br /><br />The soundtrack of Deus Ex was extolled by critics for aptly complementing the gritty and haunting atmosphere predominant throughout the game.<br /><br /><br /><br />All listed tracks were composed by Alexander Brandon, Dan Gardopee, Michiel van den Bos and Reeves Gabrels. A compact disc of the Deus Ex soundtrack was only included in the &quot;Game of the Year&quot; edition and is not available for separate purchase, but all tracks are readily available on the internet. Originally only thirty tracks were included with the re-release, with tracks thirty-one through forty-one considered as extras.<br /><br /><br /><br />During play, the music will change to a different iteration of the current song based on the player's actions. For instance, this usually occurs when the player starts a conversation, engages in combat, or transitions to the next level.{% endraw %}
