{% raw %}Ontario seeking to double skilled immigrants to address labour shortage.<br /><br /><br />TORONTO -- Ontario is calling on the federal government to double the number of immigrants allowed into the province under a program aimed at boosting the skilled workforce.<br /><br />Labour Minister Monte McNaughton says the province is facing a significant labour shortage that has been intensified by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.<br /><br />He says doubling the number of immigrants allowed under the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program from 9,000 to 18,000 a year will help tackle that shortage.<br /><br /><br />The number of job vacancies in Ontario has increased from 234,000 in October of last year to almost 316,000 vacant jobs last month, according to Statistics Canada.<br /><br />While all industries are dealing with a labour crunch, 38,000 jobs in health care, 29,000 in food services, 24,000 in manufacturing and 21,000 in construction were unfilled in the second quarter of this year.<br /><br />McNaughton says he reached out recently to the newly-appointed federal Immigration Minister, Sean Fraser, to call on him to increase the number of skilled workers allowed into Ontario under the program.<br /><br />&quot;We're asking the new minister and the federal government to double it and do it as quickly as possible,&quot; McNaughton said.<br /><br />&quot;Immigration is one of the key economic drivers of Ontario's growth, one that can be used strategically to fill critical gaps in labour supply and ultimately create more jobs in our communities.&quot;<br /><br />A spokesman for the federal immigration minister said Ontario receives the largest number of economic immigrants among all provinces and territories.<br /><br />&quot;We are currently reviewing Ontario's request to increase the number of newcomers under the (program) as we finalize next year's immigration levels plan,&quot; Alexander Cohen said.<br /><br />The Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program allows foreign skilled workers and international students to apply to the Ontario government to be nominated for permanent residency in the province, but the federal government makes the final decision on approving the applications.<br /><br />The province nominates people who have the skills and experience needed in Ontario.<br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/ontario-seeking-to-double-skilled-immigrants-to-address-labour-shortage-1.5652070">https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/ontario-seeking-to-double-skilled-immigrants-to-address-labour-shortage-1.5652070</a><br /><br />------------------Ali Says------------------<br /><br />1️⃣ QUESTIONS — Have a question about Canada Immigration 2021, Canada Immigration, Canada Immigration Process, Canada Visa, Canada PR, express entry, express entry Canada, express entry Canada 2021, Canada express entry, Express Entry Profile, IELTS Tips and Tricks, PNP Programs, PNP Program Canada, PNP Program Canada 2021, Canada PNP, PNP Canada, Canada PNP Program 2021, Alberta PNP, Ontario PNP, SINP, Manitoba PNP, PNP Draw, Express Entry Draw, IRCC Draw, NS PNP, NB New Session, BC PNP, Quebec Immigration, AIPP, RNIP, Atlantic Immigration, ECA Procedure, Educational Credentials Assessment, CES, WES, IQAS, ICES, ICAS, MCC, PEBC.
