{% raw %}Man Went To The Doctors For The ‘Flu’ Ends Up Having His Limbs Amputated<br /><br /><br /><br />Would there be any words to describe an experience of going to a doctor for treatment for flu but ending up with your limbs amputated? It sounds such a surreal nightmare rather than a prospective incident of reality but that is exactly what happened to Alex Lewis.<br /><br />1He thought it was flu but it turned out much worse<br />Alex was healthy but it’s safe to say that he was most unfortunate. Imagine coming down with the common flu only to find yourself in a hospital a few weeks later with the scary revelation that your limbs need to be amputated. Alex had no choice; he was made to undergo the agony of foregoing his limbs as a life-saving procedure. <br /><br /><br /><br />► Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
