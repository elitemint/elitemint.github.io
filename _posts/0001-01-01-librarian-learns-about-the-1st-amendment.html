{% raw %}Manchester Township NJ, came to the town to follow up on an Internal Affairs complaint.  The township's Facebook Page had illegibly banned users on their page and had a censored words list.   The township police department did remedy the issue and unbanned all individuals that were previously banned.  It is illegal under the 1st Amendment, NJ State Constitution and the case law is Van Wagner Vs. Yaede.  Google Hamilton NJ mayor and Facebook lawsuit.  <br />The municipal complex is quite large and as I arrived I saw they had a public library and I have not been to this library before.  I wanted to make a quick video and check out the library.  The first officer that arrived did not seem to pleased with my presence but the Sergeants that came knew the law and did not have any issues or concerns and informed the staff that it is a public building and recording is legal.  The librarians and staff did not want to hear  any of this 1st Amendment rights and Constitutionally protected activity nonsense so they called in the Ocean County Sheriffs department, which were rude and unprofessional.   I asked the first Sherriff to please call his supervisor to the scene and it took a long time.  The Sergeant arrived, ignored me and went inside to speak to the staff.   I stayed a while and the Sergeant and other Sherriff were gullible, when they were standing next to another persons car, I asked why are they next to my car and he starts taking pictures of their plate. <br />I will be following up with some public records requests, a trip to their next public meeting and an Internal Affairs Complaint.  In NJ the easiest way to do a public records request is to either email the clerk or records custodian or there is a dedicated website for this, opramachine.com Here in NJ there are a few lawyers that will sue on your behalf to get the records when they break the public records law, at no cost to you.  When they win, you get the paperwork and they get paid by the entity that broke the law.  <br />Auditors, I am requesting that you start looking into Public Anima Shelters and see if they are treating the animals right.  See if there is any abuse going on, check into their euthanasia logs, drug invoices, etc.... As auditors we can make a change in animal welfare and accomplish our goals to record in public.  Be safe and Godspeed.<br />@Jersey Watcher @NJ Wandering News @WolfyGladly: Accountability Inspector @News Now South Carolina @Southeastern Pa.
