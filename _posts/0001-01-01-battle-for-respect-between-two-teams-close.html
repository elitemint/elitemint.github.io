{% raw %}Two teams ranked in the Top 16 and in the field for The Dozen: Trivia Tournament II are set to square off as they look for a little more respect. 11-The Misfits (1-3-0) have had a tough Season 2, but they've played a crazy-hard schedule. Meanwhile, 14-The Misfits (2-2-0) are ranked low, but one close loss away from a stout 3-1-0 record. Will someone breakthrough tonight and impress the voters?<br /><br />The Dozen: Trivia Competition airs every Tuesday and Thursday.<br />Catch up: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/HIBgbCHN8Pk">https://youtu.be/HIBgbCHN8Pk</a><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://barstool.link/2O23KUH">https://barstool.link/2O23KUH</a><br /><br />Barstool Bites is here!
