{% raw %}More than 1,000 universities and 50 academies of science across Europe have called on the EU to “immediately” finalise the UK’s membership of its flagship £80bn research programme and end the 10-month delay to the ratification process.<br />In a letter to the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, they say the lengthy delay is “endangering current and future plans for collaboration” and any further delay will “result in a major weakening of our collective research strength”.<br /><br />I for one believe that science and the arts should never be used as a pawn in a political spat. Collaboration is for the benefit of everyone not just those countries for which they are signatories...no.<br /><br />And there's no beating around the bush that Brexit has undermined Britain's ability to contribute to science. And Alexander Boris de pfeffel Johnson moronic hard BREXIT is damaging his spaff of a high-tech economy to rebuild Britain outside of the European Union... <br /><br />This fecking idiot spaffs his 1 liners in parliament whenever asked difficult questions. &quot;We are investing 500 million&quot; frankly I'm getting sick and tired of hearing it as these monies rarely materialize... Just more spaffer Johnson government lies. But the horde laps up.. I digress<br /><br />The letter comes amid fears that the seven-year Horizon Europe programme is collateral damage in a wider political dispute between the UK and the EU overfishing licenses and the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol.<br />The UK was due to contribute about £2bn a year to stay in the programme with funds returned in the form of leading-edge research projects to British universities and research institutes on everything from vaccines to climate change technologies.<br />Now scientists say the painstaking job of putting project teams and proposals together, which can often take a year to complete, are being jeopardised because of the uncertainty over the UK’s status in potential research consortiums.<br />They urge Von der Leyen to put politics aside and press the green button on the UK’s associate membership. <br /><br />Now will this get the green or are to see Science Globally hindered because British boffins are kept out of the loop... Because a whole load a numpty put the cross in the wrong box that they did <br /><br />With your support, I won't add mid-roll adverts<br /><br />SUPPORT US HERE:<br />BUY ME A COFFEE <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/allshorts">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/allshorts</a><br />PATREON <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/allshorts">https://www.patreon.com/allshorts</a><br /><br />Follow us Here:<br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/wallybois">https://twitter.com/wallybois</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.allshorts.eu/">https://www.allshorts.eu/</a><br /><br />COOL T-SHIRTS and other  Merchandise on Teespring<br />GO BACK.
