Ever since starting a youtube channel their, I thought it would be amazing to start my own channel and show you my personality. I love entertaining, and being silly and goofy on camera. Some of my favorite videos to create include slime! I make fluffy slime, cloud slime, crunchy slime, asmr slime, and more! I also love doing 24 hour challenges, food challenges, cooking competitions and funny skits to make everyone laugh. I love doing house vlogs, and taking you guys with me on vacation!! I also love teasing my sister. We are best friends and sometimes I like to cut up her squshy's or take all of her giant gummy's!<br /><br />******FUN FACTS ABOUT ME AND MY FAMILY******<br /><br />I'm sure you have a lot of questions about my family from SmellyBellyTV.
