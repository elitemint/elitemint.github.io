{% raw %}One of the best Kinks albums!<br /><br />Lyrics:<br />Cheap is small and not too steep<br />But best of all cheap is cheap<br />Circumstance has forced my hand<br />To be a cut price person in a low budget land<br />Times are hard but we'll all survive<br />I just got to learn to economize<br /><br />I'm on a low budget<br />I'm on a low budget<br />I'm not cheap, you understand<br />I'm just a cut price person in a low budget land<br />Excuse my shoes they don't quite fit<br />They're a special offer and they hurt me a bit<br />Even my trousers are giving me pain<br />They were reduced in a sale so I shouldn't complain<br />They squeeze me so tight so I can't take no more<br />They're size 28 but I take 34<br /><br />I'm on a low budget<br />What did you say<br />I'm on a low budget<br />I thought you said that<br /><br />I'm on a low budget<br />I'm a cut price person in a low budget land<br /><br />I'm shopping at Woolworth and low discount stores<br />I'm dropping my standards so that I can buy more<br /><br />[Quality costs, but quality wastes,<br />So I'm giving up all of my expensive tastes.<br />Caviar and champagne are definite no's,<br />I'm acquiring a taste for brown ale and cod roes ]<br /><br />Low budget sure keeps me on my toes<br />I count every penny and I watch where it goes<br />We're all on our uppers we're all going skint<br />I used to smoke cigars but now I suck polo mints<br /><br />I'm on a low budget<br />What did you say<br />Yea I'm on a low budget<br />I thought you said that<br />I'm on a low budget<br />I'm a cut price person in a low budget land<br />I'm on a low budget<br />Low budget<br />Low budget<br /><br />Art takes time, time is money<br />Money's scarce and that ain't funny<br />Millionaires are things of the past<br />We're in a low budget film where nothing can last<br />Money's rare there's none to be found<br />So don't think I'm tight if I don't buy a round<br /><br />I'm on a low budget<br />What did you say<br />Yes I'm on a low budget<br />I thought you said that<br />I'm on a low budget<br />I'm a cut price person in a low budget land<br />I'm on a low budget<br />Say it again<br />Low budget<br />One more time<br />Low budget<br /><br />I look like a tramp, but don't write me off,<br />I'll have you all know, I was once a toff<br />At least my hair is all mine, my teeth are my own,<br />But everything else is on permanent loan.<br />Once all my clothes were made by hand,<br />Now I'm a cut price person in a low budget land.<br />I'm on a low budget<br />I'll have you all know<br />We're on a low budget<br />I'm on a low budget{% endraw %}
