The invite format is similar to the format used for the preceding International, whereby a point system based on official sponsored Regional Leagues and Majors will be used to determine the teams invited to The International.<br /><br />The tournament was originally scheduled to be held from August 18th to 23rd, 2020 in Avicii Arena in Stockholm, Sweden. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Valve delayed the event to 2021 tentatively. Valve later announced that the event will take place on August 5th to 15th, 2021.
