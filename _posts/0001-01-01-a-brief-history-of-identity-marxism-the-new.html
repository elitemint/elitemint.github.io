{% raw %}The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 56 <br /><br />The ideology that is most conveniently identified as &quot;Wokeness&quot; is much more accurately described by the phrase Identity Marxism. That is, Wokeness is a Marxian approach to identity politics for similar aims to those Marxism has always touted. In this regard, Critical Race Theory is Race Marxism; Critical Gender Theory is Gender Marxism; Queer Theory is Gender, Sex, and Sexuality Marxism; Fat Studies is Fat Marxism; Postcolonial Theory is Postcolonial Marxism; and Disability Studies is Disability Marxism. All together, working intersectionally, they are one new species of Marxism: Identity Marxism. In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay walks the listener through a history of the various strains of Marxist thought to make the case that Wokeness is best thought of this way. Indeed, it must be understood this way. In so doing, he elucidates what Marxism really represents as a broad, overarching philosophy (or, religion) and indicates that the various species of Marxism, including vulgar, Cultural, neo-, and now Identity Marxism, are all essentially the same project in different guises. Join him for a penetrating discussion that frames Wokeness as it really is.<br /><br />Support New Discourses:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/newdiscourses">https://www.paypal.me/newdiscourses</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://newdiscourses.locals.com/support">https://newdiscourses.locals.com/support</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patreon.com/newdiscourses">https://patreon.com/newdiscourses</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://subscribestar.com/newdiscourses">https://subscribestar.com/newdiscourses</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9K5PLkj0N_b9JTPdSRwPkg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9K5PLkj0N_b9JTPdSRwPkg/join</a><br /><br />Website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://newdiscourses.com">https://newdiscourses.com</a><br /><br />Follow:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/newdiscourses">https://facebook.com/newdiscourses</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/NewDiscourses">https://twitter.com/NewDiscourses</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/newdiscourses">https://instagram.com/newdiscourses</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://newdiscourses.locals.com/">https://newdiscourses.locals.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pinterest.com/newdiscourses/">https://pinterest.com/newdiscourses/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linkedin.com/company/newdiscourses">https://linkedin.com/company/newdiscourses</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://minds.com/newdiscourses">https://minds.com/newdiscourses</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://reddit.com/r/NewDiscourses">https://reddit.com/r/NewDiscourses</a><br /><br />Podcast:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/newdiscourses">https://soundcloud.com/newdiscourses</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/new-discourses/id1499880546">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/new-discourses/id1499880546</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/NDGooglePodcasts">http://bit.ly/NDGooglePodcasts</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0HfzDaXI5L4LnJQStFWgZp">https://open.spotify.com/show/0HfzDaXI5L4LnJQStFWgZp</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://stitcher.com/podcast/new-discourses">https://stitcher.com/podcast/new-discourses</a><br /><br />Â© 2021 New Discourses.
