There are certain rules to be followed while using this phrase.<br /><br />Website : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.letstalkpodcast.com">http://www.letstalkpodcast.com</a><br />Facebook page : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/letstalkpodcast">http://www.facebook.com/letstalkpodcast</a><br /><br />‘A pair of’ is used for two things that come together or used together. For example a pair of shoes, a pair of scissors etc.<br /><br />A pair of: <br /><br />When you talk about just one pair, you use ‘a pair of’ followed by the noun in the plural. This is because there are two objects that comprise a pair. But the verb following ‘a pair of …’ is always singular as we are talking about one pair.<br /><br />Example: This pair of shoes is smart.<br />Example: Your pair of glasses is broken.<br />Example: The pair of diamond earrings is expensive.<br /><br />In the above sentences, the nouns, shoes, glasses and earrings are in plural, but the verb in each of the sentences is singular.<br /><br />‘Pairs of’: <br /><br />When you talk about more than one pair, use ‘pairs’.  The verb that follows ‘pairs of…’ is always plural as we are talking about multiple pairs of something.<br /><br />Example: Several pairs of shoes are missing.<br />Example: Two pairs of spectacles are in the drawer.<br />Example: Five pairs of earrings cost a lot of money.<br /><br />In the above sentences, the verbs-are and cost are in the plural as we are talking about many pairs of something.{% endraw %}
