{% raw %}Sustainability is a global challenge and a strategic goal for Koehler Paper Group from Germany. Producing the tools to meet this challenge this is also a global task. For the new paper machine 8 at Koehlerâ€™s Kehl mill, the company manufactured the world's largest Yankee dryer. After manufacturing it in Brazil, Koehler documented the dryer's journey to the Kehl mill. With the Yankee dryer, Koehler will be able to produce barrier paper that will replace plastic in flexible packaging.{% endraw %}
