Hosted by Tiger Woods, the event features a top-tier field of FedExCup champions, TOUR and global stars. Past FedExCup champions Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson are all set to tee it up. Spieth will play for the first time since becoming a father on November 14. He won this event by 10 shots in 2014 when it was contested at Isleworth, setting the stage for his historic 2015 that saw him win two majors and the FedExCup. Collin Morikawa, the highest-ranked player in the field, is fresh off a victory at the DP World Tour Championship that made him the first American to claim the Race to Dubai. Meanwhile, both Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau are in the field after Fridayâ€™s much-discussed match in Las Vegas, which Koepka won convincingly. Other players to look out for include Justin Rose, Xander Schauffele, Patrick Reed, Abraham Ancer, Viktor Hovland and Sam Burns.<br /><br /><br /><br />Check out <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pgatour.com">https://www.pgatour.com</a> for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!<br /><br /><br /><br />Follow PGA TOUR online:<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/pgatour/">https://instagram.com/pgatour/</a>  <br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PGATour">https://www.facebook.com/PGATour</a>  <br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/PGATOUR">https://twitter.com/PGATOUR</a><br /><br />SoundCloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/pgatour">https://soundcloud.com/pgatour</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Sign up for exclusive coverage - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pgatourlive.com">http://www.pgatourlive.com</a><br /><br />PGA TOUR Superstore - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/">http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/</a>{% endraw %}
