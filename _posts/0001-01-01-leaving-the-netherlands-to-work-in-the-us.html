{% raw %}This gives you just a bit of small insight on working in the US and some of the (or not) benefits that may (or may not) come to you with a new job. I can tell you this â€¦from an outsider just looking in at the the people working in the Netherlands you do look much happier, more satisfied and are just plain enjoying life as a Dutch person. People here in Rotterdam and the Netherlands seem to be able to separate work from their personal life, because this is something that is very difficult to do for the US worker. Working in the US can be very physically and mentally exhausting.{% endraw %}
