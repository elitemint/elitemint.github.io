{% raw %}Welcome to The Founder's Diary<br /><br />This is our journey from how we went from the council estate to becoming medical doctors. 4% of doctors come from working class backgrounds, we face greater challenges and obstacles so when we make it, it means more.<br /><br />We share our journey to let you know we can all do whatever we can imagine - this is a series to not only share our journey from the start but also going forwards as we are now on a journey to build a platform to put education and opportunity into the hands of everyone.<br /><br />🎙️ Scrubbed In Weekly Podcast <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/3sfsubf​​">https://apple.co/3sfsubf​​</a> (Apple) <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spoti.fi/2LoV4X5​​">https://spoti.fi/2LoV4X5​​</a> (Spotify)<br /><br />📮 Newsletter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://scrubbedin.substack.com/​​">https://scrubbedin.substack.com/​​</a><br />📸 Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/scrubbedin_​​">https://www.instagram.com/scrubbedin_​​</a><br />🐦 Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ScrubbedIn_​​">https://twitter.com/ScrubbedIn_​​</a><br />🌍 Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://scrubbedin.co.uk/​​">https://scrubbedin.co.uk/​​</a>{% endraw %}
