{% raw %}Terrible : La Palma Volcano new lava stream that burns building towards Sea at high speed<br /><br />Activity drops for the moment, but new surge of magma likely to arrive in the near future.<br /><br />After the surge of magma during the past days, the activity has now dropped again significantly, but there is a new signal of ground uplift, which suggests that a new batch of magma is on the rise and currently being stored and likely to come out as a new surge probably in the next days There is certainly no sign of the eruption ending soon.<br /><br />Even if it has been gradually decreasing today, the explosive and effusive activity from the new (as well, to a lesser extent from the old) vents are continuing. Volcanic tremor remains comparably high and has strong temporary peaks, indicating magma flux remains significant.<br /><br />#Lapalma #Volcano #IGME #ING #Cumbrevieja #Spain #Canaryisland #VOA #THESUN #DW #TVE #Guardiacivil #Globalnews #Skynews{% endraw %}
