{% raw %}The finish line is in sight but we're not done yet.<br />Every buyer's lender must have a final review of all the reports, documents and situation.<br />Reputable lenders have the best track record of avoiding blowups at the end.<br /><br />How do we know when it's actually approved? The key words are &quot;clear to close!&quot; <br />The Closing Disclosure (CD) must be issued and a 3 day wait period begins.<br /><br />When do you know your final numbers? We do our best to get it as early as we can but it could be the morning of closing. Your Transaction Coordinator will email you the final numbers, if you have questions, contact your Listing Agent.<br /><br />The final walk-through is usually 1-3 days prior to closing. Your TC or buyer's agent will call you to set up the time. You will need to be accommodating to let them in. Any questions, ask your TC or Listing Agent.{% endraw %}
