{% raw %}This general effect driven show by Randall Standridge explores the elements of art.  Standridge's work Vanishing Point serves as inspiration for the opening segment &quot;Lines.&quot;  A steady groove pulses as the woodwinds and brass go back and forth in the middle segment &quot;Balance,&quot; and the show comes to a stirring conclusion in its final segment &quot;Colors.&quot;  Additional sound FX and narration provide multiple opportunities for staging, props, and creativity to provide a &quot;high end&quot; show that is still audience friendly.{% endraw %}
