{% raw %}The path to understanding General Relativity starts at the Metric Tensor. But this mathematical tool is so deeply entrenched in esoteric symbolism and complex mathematics that its simplistic, intuitive purpose often goes neglected. Here we attempt to expose the basic principles behind the Metric Tensor -- and investigate how they tie into General Relativity -- in as simplistic a manner as possible. Do we succeed? Feel free to let us know in the comments!{% endraw %}
