{% raw %}Ivan Fedorov, a courtier in Ivan the IV’s court was accused of plotting against the first Tsar of Russia, Ivan the IV. Against all expectations, Ivan gave Fedorov a royal welcome in his court. He forced the trembling plotter to don the royal robes, handed him the royal scepter, and pushed him to sit on the royal throne.<br /><br />Ivan the IV then bowed to Fedorov and told him “Only I have the power in the entire Russia to make you sit on this throne and so only I can also unseat you.” And then Ivan the Terrible stabbed Fedorov several times to death in front of everyone. You have to give him props! Even contemporary literature maestro Shakespeare couldn’t think of such imaginative ways to kill his characters in Othello and Macbeth.<br /><br />Welcome to Nutty History, and today let’s find out all the creepy things Ivan the IV did to earn the title of “The Terrible”. <br /><br />------------------------------------<br /><br />More Nutty History 🥜<br /><br />☠️ What Punishment was Like 🗡 <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...</a><br /><br />😳 More CREEPY things that were normal:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...</a><br /><br />------------------------------------<br /><br />Thank you so much for watching our video!
