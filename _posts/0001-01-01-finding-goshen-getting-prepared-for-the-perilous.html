{% raw %}Finding Goshen part 2 may be the most practical and informative video released on the subject of what to do to survive and even thrive in the end times period. In this video, G. Steven Simons speaks on subjects like: preparing your physical body to fight off the deadly diseases to come, finding your safe place and growing your own food, understanding bartering and the redefinition of wealth, and using the revelation you have received to provide safety and provision for your family and sphere of influence. This is a “Must See” video!<br /><br />Message Notes: www.triumpintruth.global/messagenotes<br /><br />Thank you for watching Triumph In Truth. We hope you enjoyed this video!
