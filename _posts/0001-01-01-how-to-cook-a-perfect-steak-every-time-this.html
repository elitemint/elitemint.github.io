{% raw %}This is the best way to cook a steak, without a doubt. And if that didn't get you... It takes little to no active time, is all done in a pan, and is extremely easy as long as you follow some of these really simple rules. Plus, with  Valentines day coming around the corner, and also because steak is the best, this seemed like a good idea to upload. So whether you're cooking a ribeye, t-bone, sirloin, or strip steak, this recipe is for you. <br /><br />My favorite cast iron pan for steaks: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2GnpJjq">https://amzn.to/2GnpJjq</a><br />The Book I was holding: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2I3THKX">https://amzn.to/2I3THKX</a><br /><br />FOLLOW ME:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/joshuaweissman">https://www.instagram.com/joshuaweissman</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/thejoshuaweissman">https://www.facebook.com/thejoshuaweissman</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/therealweissman">https://twitter.com/therealweissman</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://joshuaweissman.com/">http://joshuaweissman.com/</a><br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br />Music - Saib: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/saib_eats">https://soundcloud.com/saib_eats</a><br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br />Cuts of Steak I recommend:<br />Ribeye (my favorite)<br />Sirloin<br />Strip (also known as new york strip)<br />T-Bone or Porterhouse (be aware that you have two diff cuts on this which means it's going to cook at diff degrees on both sides)<br /><br />Ingredients you'll need:<br />1-2 large steak that is 1.5-2 inches thick (You can also do two steaks at a time per pan if you wish if your pan accommodates two without overcrowding the pan)<br />Kosher Salt to taste<br />Black Pepper to taste<br />2-4 cloves garlic, lightly crushed left in the skin<br />1 bunch of fresh thyme<br />4 tablespoons (56g) unsalted butter<br /><br />Temperatures To pull your steak out of the pan:<br />Rare: 125F (52C)<br />Medium Rare: 135F (57C)<br />Medium 145F (63C) *wait what are you...*<br />Medium Well 150F (66C) *wait.. stop*<br />Well Done 160F (71c) *oh.* <br />*I'm joking, if you like your steak well done I won't make fun of you.
