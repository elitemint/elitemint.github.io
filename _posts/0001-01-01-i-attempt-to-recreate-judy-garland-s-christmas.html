{% raw %}Have you ever seen a dress and immediately know you have to make it? When I saw Meet Me In St Louis for the first time I fell in love with Judy Garland's gorgeous red velvet Christmas gown. How can you not love it? Of course I have a soft spot for 1940s does turn of the century that a lot of movie musicals did so well back then. Its not quite historical but not quite contemporary. I don't go into too much detail about the construction method of this dress because 98% of it was just following the instructions from the pattern and my original edit of this video was around 40 minutes. <br /><br />This was my first time working with velvet and honestly it wasn't as hard as I expected it to be. I will definitely be working with cotton velveteen again. This was also my first experience draping. That didn't go nearly as well.<br /><br />Patterns:<br />Dress: Simplicity 4078<br /><br />Sleeves: I used a sleeve pattern similar to DuBarry 1926B. I don't have the number of the pattern I used because The instructions and envelope are absolutely disintegrating at this point but it was a DuBarry pattern from the 1930s<br /><br />Fabric: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fabric.com/buy/0416182/kaufman-lush-velveteen-scarlet">https://www.fabric.com/buy/0416182/kaufman-lush-velveteen-scarlet</a><br /><br />Music courtesy of EpidemicSound.com<br /><br />Follow me on instagram @ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/actor_sam_snow">https://www.instagram.com/actor_sam_snow</a>{% endraw %}
