{% raw %}PAYPAL DONATIONS: HTTPS://paypal.me/model3man<br />Tesla's Software Update - The HOLIDAY Update or more accurately Version 11 - is a MAJOR departure from the previous interface. Some people LOVE it, many HATE it - but everyone is a little confused about where all of the familiar settings and buttons have gone to.
