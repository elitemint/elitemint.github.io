{% raw %}If you want to learn to develop your psychic abilities, you need to start with fine tuning your physical and psychic senses. (You need to combine and use your 5 senses in order to get to your 6th sense).<br />Everything in the universe carries its own unique resonant signature that is comprised of  life experiences, DNA, external/internal environment etc. If we want to learn the language of the universe and understand what it's trying to say, we must first begin by identifying the different energies around us. <br />Spend the next week noticing how different shifts in energy make you feel. If someone walks into the room you are in, see if you can feel for the energetic shift that takes place when they walk by you. Or when you are waking by a tree. Try and feel for the field of energy that surrounds the tree.  It can be felt as a soft tingle, or as rapid goosebumps, depending on what/who you are tuning into. <br />These &quot;shifts&quot; of energy is what I started to notice when first beginning on my journey of psychic development. <br /><br />Stay tuned for the next episode as I explain more on how to develop your psychic senses!<br />#psychicdevelopment #remoteviewing #psychic #sixthsense{% endraw %}
