{% raw %}Twin flame forgiveness is one of the most challenging topics to discuss within twin flame connection. The word &quot;forgiveness&quot; itself is inherently emotionally charged. Usually, when we think about &quot;forgiving&quot; we are focusing on a condition we feel has been violated in some way. In truth, twin flame forgiveness is equivalent to releasing / letting go. It is freeing both ourselves and the other from the entrapment in cycles of pain, guilt, shame and fear. Although we can (and should) set boundaries in the 3D and I am by no means saying we should accept any kind of behavior/treatment, true forgiveness is something that shifts within us internally and doesn't require external action. It is very closely related to the surrender phase of twin flame connection, where we lean fully into trust and allowing of divine timing + guidance rather than attempts to control through conditions.
