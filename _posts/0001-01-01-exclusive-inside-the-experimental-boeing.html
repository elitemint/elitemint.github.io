{% raw %}At Dubai Airshow 2021, I visited the Boeing 777X. This is the first time Boeing allows visitors to get onboard the airplane! Let’s find out what’s inside the 777X is like?<br /><br />It is an experimental airplane with no fancy interiors but a lot of workstations, terminals, and water barrel tanks. I spoke with Boeing test engineers, pilots, and commercial staff on the 777X testing and certification program. Check out the cockpit, folding wingtip, engine, and test instrument inside the aircraft. Boeing expects the B777X to complete certification in 2023.<br /><br />Enjoy the flying display of B777X at Dubai Airshow.{% endraw %}
