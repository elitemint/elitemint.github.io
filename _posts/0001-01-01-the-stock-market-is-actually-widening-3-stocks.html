{% raw %}LIVE TRADING CHANNEL: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/TheStockMarket">https://www.youtube.com/TheStockMarket</a><br /><br />The stock market had another day of good and bad news that ultimately led to a melt up ahead of earnings. With this seemingly normal for earnings season, an anonamly with the FAANG stocks is showing this could be because the stock market has widened out. I go over all of this and give a quick market recap. We had TSLA earnings after hours but the stock barely moved as the report was good but not perfect. There was also a brief market jolt today as Fed member Quarles said the Fed may need to reassess their plan if inflation stays above 4% in spring. We also will be getting Evergrande un-halting tomorrow. With so much good and bad news at the same time, investors will be eyeing for the next set of earnings to solidify their decisions.
