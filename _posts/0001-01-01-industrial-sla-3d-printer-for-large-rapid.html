{% raw %}This is a Fuel cell development &amp; testing machine from the Legend Energy company based in Shanghai, China.<br />A new design to show to their customers.<br />This model is made with industrial SLA 3D printers, build volume: 800*800*550mm / 600*600*400mm, print separately and then glue together and do the surface treatment as client required.<br />From printing to delivery, took 3 days.<br /><br />Advantage of a SLA 3D printer is:<br /> 1). Fast speed, max speed can reach 400g/h (the fastest speed for a 3D printer).<br />2). High accuracy-max can reach 0.05mm (the most important thing is unlike the SLS/ FDM 3D priner, the surface can be polished easily using sand paper if client has higher requirements).<br />3). Can deal with any models with complex structure.<br />4). A variety of materials are available, such as normal white resin for rapid prototype (price is cheap); high temperature resistant resin for master mold can resist temperature of 200 degrees. Clear resin for any glass-alike prototype, and also PP- alike soft resin for shoes, shoe soles or other applications.<br />5). Large building volume: in the market, max. 2100 or bigger is available.<br />6). It can be used in nearly any industry: automobile, aerospace, artistic design, cultural relics reproduction, building sand table model, any kind of medical models, shoe industry etc.<br /><br />Should anyone has new requirements or new applications, welcome to exchange ideas with us.<br />Regards<br />Lora{% endraw %}
