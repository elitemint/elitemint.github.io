At the moment I'm really enjoying playing Call of Duty Warzone whilst we wait for Battlefield 2042 gameplay, details and information. I mainly do Battlefield gameplay and Battlefield sniping on all the different games: Battlefield 5, Battlefield 1, Battlefield 4 and Battlefield 3. I often play solos, duos, trios and squads. I have over 1000 hours experience in every Battlefield and I hope to play more FPS games in 2021 and 2022. I hope you enjoy my sniper gameplay and Warzone gameplay as much as I do making it.{% endraw %}
