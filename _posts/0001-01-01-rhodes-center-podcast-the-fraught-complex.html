{% raw %}On this episode Mark talks with Martin Sandbu, a journalist at the Financial Times and author of 'The Economics of Belonging.' In addition to having a great title, the book provides a penetrating explanation for why so many people have come to feel so left behind in wealthy Western countries. Mark and Martin discuss the role economics plays in this discontent, and look at how radical economic policy could help not just boost national GDP's and employment rates in the West, but renew a widespread sense of citizenship and belonging.<br /><br /><br />You can learn more about and purchase Martin's book here: press.princeton.edu/books/hardcoverâ€¦cs-of-belonging<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />To hear the latest Rhodes Center Podcast episodes as soon as they're released, subscribe on Soundcloud [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/rhodescenter]">https://soundcloud.com/rhodescenter]</a> or on your favorite podcast app.{% endraw %}
