{% raw %}Holiday Season Deal! Go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nordvpn.com/trektrendy">https://nordvpn.com/trektrendy</a> to get 73% off a two year plan plus one additional month free, only Â£2.34 per month.<br /><br />I'm flying Air France Business Class on their dated Boeing 777-300ER for 8 hours from Chicago O'Hare to Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport. Come with me as I give a brutally honest review of my experience, from the ground service &amp; lounge provision to the onboard soft &amp; hard product. It's especially interesting to me, as my previous long haul flights with Air France were exclusively onboard La Premiere. So this should offer an interesting point of  comparison. <br /><br />As with all my trip reports, I'll provide an honest account of the flight, allowing you to understand if this is the right Business Class ticket for your next trip, whether that be for vacation or work. <br /><br />I also pass the question off to you, what do you think to Air France Business Class, have you flown it and if do you draw the same conclusions? <br /><br />You can keep up with my trips live over on IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/will.luxurytravel">https://www.instagram.com/will.luxurytravel</a>{% endraw %}
