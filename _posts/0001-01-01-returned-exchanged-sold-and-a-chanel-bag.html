{% raw %}So yes.... I'm full of a cold and there's a bit more background noise than I anticipated. But still- I thought it was fun!<br />I considered putting some background music on but thought it might be a bit much- what do you guys think? <br /><br />As I said in the video- I sold my Gucci. It was so lovely to see Styled4life unboxing the Gucci Marmont on her YouTube channel- so happy it went to a good home:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8ThQNlDJHc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8ThQNlDJHc</a><br /><br />My top: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3GCkcka">https://bit.ly/3GCkcka</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/emmaandersbags">https://www.instagram.com/emmaandersbags</a>{% endraw %}
