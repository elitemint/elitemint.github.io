{% raw %}Haarp or not? Maybe it's god's will? Please comment below!<br /><br />Fresh snow fell in many parts of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand as weather conditions in northern India began to change in preparation for the cold winter. Many people were stuck in the Himachal Lahaul and Spiti area due to inclement weather as the roads remained blocked. Snowfall began at the high peaks of Gangotri and Yamunotri Dham as temperatures dropped in the low-lying areas of the Uttarkashi region. The Manali-Leh highway was closed to normal traffic due to fresh snow at Baralacha Pass in the Lahaul and Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh. At least 80 passengers were stuck in this area. A layer of snow covered the Dhauladhar Mountains, visible from Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh, when the region experienced the first snowfall of the season. Cold weather, however, is not to everyone's liking. Three trekkers from a group of 13 died after heavy snowfall in the Kinnaur area of ​​Himachal Pradesh state, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police said. Trekkers started their ascent from Rohru to Burua village in the Kinnaur region and got stuck in Burua Kanda due to snowfall. Extreme weather events against the backdrop of a delayed end to the monsoons over the past several weeks have raised the alarm about the extremely cold conditions in India's northern belt. Experts warned that due to the La Nini effect, the temperature of the mercury would drop to 3 degrees Celsius. India's Meteorological Department has already predicted this week heavy rainfall, thunderstorm snowfalls, gusty winds and lightning in isolated locations over Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab.<br /><br />#snow #snowfall #ice #blizzard #india #pradesh #punjub{% endraw %}
