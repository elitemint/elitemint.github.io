{% raw %}Virtual Escape Room (aka VERs) is a new initiative that was co-piloted alongside with Faculty of Health and Life Sciences' Sports and Exercise team and Disruptive Media Learning Lab's Game Changers. <br /><br /><br />Here the concept and game design of escape rooms have been applied to the hybrid learning approach to quickly adapt to the speed of need, by redesigning its mother initiative, EscapED, into a virtual environment to create a new online space for students and academics to collaborate in their teams to solve the puzzles and break out of the rooms. <br /><br /><br />This video introduces and provides viewers with a basic breakdown of how VERs are conducted and the instructional game design behind its creation.<br /><br /><br />This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0 Generic License.{% endraw %}
