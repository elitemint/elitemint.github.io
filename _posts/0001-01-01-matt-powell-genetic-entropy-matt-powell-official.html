{% raw %}@Matt Powell OFFICIAL predicts humans are going to go extinct in a few generations. Apparently DNA proves it. It also shows we were created 'perfect' around 6,000 years ago*. Or something. Did @Kent Hovind OFFICIAL teach you this or did you make it up yourself Matt?<br /><br />*Some of these claims may be untrue!<br /><br />Matt also wants to debate @AronRa Bill Nye The Science Guy and @Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason &amp; Science  ...   Yeah. Right!<br /><br /> --------------------------------------------------------<br />#MattPowell #Creationist #GeneticEntropy<br /><br /><br />Donate via Willow: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://wlo.link/@MrSensible">https://wlo.link/@MrSensible</a><br />Support on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/MrSensible">https://www.patreon.com/MrSensible</a><br />Follow on twitter: @ItsMrSensible<br />Contact on Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/G6Spd6XkJf​">https://discord.gg/G6Spd6XkJf​</a><br /><br />Please subscribe and be Sensible!<br /><br />Stay Sensible<br />--------------------------------------------------------<br />Additional Music &amp; Sound:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bensound.com">https://www.bensound.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.zapsplat.com">https://www.zapsplat.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.purple-planet.com">https://www.purple-planet.com</a>{% endraw %}
