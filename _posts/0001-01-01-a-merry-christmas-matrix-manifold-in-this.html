{% raw %}In this video I bring you along as I swap out a leaking and cracked manifold on a 2008 Toyota Matrix 1.8 that is filling the cabin full of exhaust fumes. The car is pretty old and rotted so I use an aftermarket manifold (Dorman) and of course it doesn't fit like it should. I wouldn't expect any thing less. -Enjoy!<br /><br />If an SMA Video has helped you out please consider giving using &quot;Patreon&quot; to help support us.
