{% raw %}Trifle will appear on more Christmas tables this year than Christmas pudding in the UK. It's a timeless classic, seeped in history that dates back to Tudor times and King Henry VIII. <br /><br />The ultimate comfort food, a dish that I served to Princes William and Harry in the Royal nursery and also The Queen and her guests over the holidays. <br /><br />Every home cook believes they have the best trifle recipe... well, here's mine!  Delicious strawberry jam sponge seeped in Drambuie syrup, syrup, sprinkled with raspberries, strawberries and blueberries and covered with a layer of gorgeous home made vanilla bean egg custard. Then topped with whipped cream and sprinkled with grated chocolate. What's not to love about TRIFLE!<br /><br />CHECK OUT CHEF DARREN MCGRADY MERCH;   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/my-store-10454264">https://teespring.com/stores/my-store-10454264</a><br /><br />Here's a link to the PERFECT Holiday gifts.

Layer into a large glass bowl and sprinkle with the raspberries. <br /><br />In a small pan boil the sugar and water for about 5 minutes to make a syrup. Add the sherry (if using) to the syrup and pour over the sponge.<br /><br />Bring the 1 pint of heavy cream to a boil in a large saucepan. Whilst it is heating, mix the egg yolks, sugar, vanilla and cornstarch together in a small bowl. Pour the boiling cream over the egg mix and return it to the pan. Stir over a low heat until it just starts to thicken. Don’t over cook. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly before pouring over the sponge. <br /><br />Refrigerate the trifle until the custard has set. Then spoon the whipped cream over the top of the custard. Decorate with the chocolate flake or grated chocolate and almonds. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Disclaimer: As an Amazon associate I earn from qualified purchases{% endraw %}
