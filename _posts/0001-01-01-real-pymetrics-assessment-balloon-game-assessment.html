{% raw %}This was my attempt for Woodside vacation program. My suggestion would be to be relaxed mentally and physically before attempting the test. I had seen my friend giving this test almost 2 years back for Rio Tinto and it still had exactly the same questions. So if you are familiar with the questions, you can mentally prepare yourself for what to expect in the test and how to perform well in the exam. <br /><br />P.S. I haven't heard anything back yet from Woodside. I kind of applied in the last few days before the deadline.{% endraw %}
