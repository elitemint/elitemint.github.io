{% raw %}Many experts agree that globalization has raised standards of living in much of the world and has contributed to millions of people rising out of poverty, but all agree that some have been negatively impacted in a substantial way. The same lesson should be learned from the Pandemic. We see the under-skilled and under-educated impacted the most by shutdowns. In this talk, Andy stressed that we must leverage the promise and unlimited possibility of technology to reap the benefits that technology can bring to our people and our economies by acting strategically and collaboratively -- globally, nationally, and in our communities; and empower our workforce. Andy oversees Huawei USA's cyber security assurance program.   worked at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security where he was the senior cyber security official of the U.S. Government from 2004-2006.  Prior to joining the DHS, Andy was a member of the White House staff where he helped to draft the U.S. National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace (2003), after which he went to the DHS where he helped to form and then led the National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) and the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT).  Immediately prior to joining Huawei, Andy was the Chief Cybersecurity Strategist for Computer Sciences Corporation. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
