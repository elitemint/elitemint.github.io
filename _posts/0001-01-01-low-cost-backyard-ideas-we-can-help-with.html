They light up your space adding distinction to your entire outdoor area. A low-cost option adding loads of value.<br /><br />2)    Simple Fire Pit: another low-cost backyard idea is a simple fire pit. You might think that's a bit expensive, but this is something you can do yourself very easily. A wood burning fire pit with brick from a local hardware store - build the base - fill the walls.<br /><br />3)    Backyard Movie Theatres: a low-cost backyard idea is an outdoor movie theater. No, it does not cost that much to create a DYI. I think I spent like $30 for my screen and then a simple projector – there are many different price points.<br /><br />4)    Water Features: another low-cost option for a backyard idea is a water feature. You can go very cost effective with these do-it-yourself projects. A flowerpot turns into a beautiful bubbler or you could do more of a meandering water feature.<br /><br />5)    Wood Retaining Wall: Using wood to retain the property can be a cost-effective option instead of building it out of concrete or concrete block. or some of the other material that he could have cost option for<br /><br />6)    Dry Creek Beds: are cool features – they are basically River Rock which you can buy in bulk at an inexpensive price point. They create a nice destination of the nice but also do a phenomenal job of handling drainage.<br /><br />7)    Gravel Patio: on a budget - use gravel as a patio. You can do this in a way that makes it look like it was stylistically what you chose instead of a low-cost option.<br /><br />8)    Hammocks: Create a little destination using a hammock.<br /><br />9)      Privacy Screens: Privacy is a huge concern for many people and there are many low-cost options.<br /><br />For additional landscape design ideas, we welcome your visit to our gallery of works in our portfolio   <br /><br />Visit our YouTube Channel<br /><br />Complimentary Consultation?
