{% raw %}SAY IT BEFORE YOU SEE IT!!!⠀<br />⠀<br />It was July 2020.⠀<br />⠀<br />@MILLIONSConference 2020 (which was our first ever world wide virtual experience) had just ended the weekend before. By the grace of God it was a great success.⠀<br />⠀<br />I flew into Atlanta for a one day meeting and GOLD agreed to pick me up and take me right back to the airport. A quick turnaround.⠀<br />⠀<br />And because I play waaaayyyyyy too much, I jokingly said to him, “Take me to the studio. I wanna make a HIT SINGLE!!!”⠀<br />⠀<br />He laughed (cause I’m funny😅), turned the car around and actually took meeee.😵‍💫😮‍💨⠀<br />⠀<br />We got there and he told me to go in the room and start signing.⠀<br />⠀<br />Nobody:⠀<br />⠀<br />Me: Wait. I was just playing. I can’t sing. Please. Make it stoppppppppppppppp.😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫⠀<br />⠀<br />He waited until I finished over exaggerating, handed me a piece of paper and a pen, and closed the door. My flight was scheduled to leave in 2 hours. ⠀<br />⠀<br />The pressure was on.⠀<br />Except…there was no pressure.⠀<br />⠀<br />I opened up my Bible and went to Deuteronomy 1:11. It reminded me who God said that we are.⠀<br />⠀<br />We are called to be: ⠀<br />GREATER!!!⠀<br />GREATER!!!⠀<br />GREATER!!!⠀<br />⠀<br />So I sang this song (all parts - alto, soprano, tenor like Ray Charles😎- haahhhahah) and made it to my fight on time.⠀<br />⠀<br />And do you think I released my hit single immediately after my studio session? ⠀<br />⠀<br />Nooooo.⠀<br /> ⠀<br />One month went by. Then another. Then another. Then another. And then another.⠀<br />⠀<br />Until 2021. When I finally took the advice of my song and DECIDED to be “GREATER!!!”⠀<br />⠀<br />I released it on Friday at MILLIONS 2021 and that day alone we were already #3 on the iTune charts!!! (I still can't believe it!! lol)⠀<br /><br />A week later we were #3 on BILLBOARD!!!😵‍💫😮‍💨<br />⠀<br />I just wanted a “HIT SINGLE” as a joke, but as always my joke manifested into something GREATER!!!😩⠀<br /> ⠀<br />It may seem like this snuck up on me, but I actually spoke it into existence before it was created. ⠀<br />⠀<br />I said it before I saw it!!! ⠀<br />⠀<br />You should start doing the same.⠀<br /> ⠀<br />Anywho, thanks for getting me to #3. ⠀<br /> ⠀<br />Download my new single on iTunes!! ⠀<br />(Search: Tiphani Montgomery)⠀<br /> ⠀<br />xx⠀<br /> ⠀<br />Tiphani⠀<br />⠀{% endraw %}
