XForce is used to activate any Autodesk products, and the process is the same for any other activator. <br /><br />The first thing we have to do is;<br />Disable all the securities and protections like 3rd party antivirus, windows security, windows defender, Firewalls etc.<br /><br />The second thing we have to do is;<br />Disable your internet until you finish the activation process.<br /><br />The 3rd thing is to copy your activator to the relevant program folder. <br /><br />The last thing is to make sure you right-click on it and click on the run as administrator. And continue further steps as per the requirement of that particular software or program. <br /><br />Thank you so much for watching this video; if you have any<br />Comment or feedback you can drop it in the comment box below.
