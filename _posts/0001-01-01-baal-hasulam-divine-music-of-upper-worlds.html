{% raw %}Melodies of the Upper Worlds features melodies of the 20th century's greatest Kabbalist, Baal HaSulam (Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag)<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/mmedia.htm">http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/mmedia.htm</a><br /><br />Music and Kabbalah... What is the connection between them? <br /><br />Everyone has a conception of what music is, but not everyone, by far, knows what Kabbalah is.<br /> <br />The essence of Kabbalah is shrouded in secrecy, but there has  always been an interest in Kabbalah. According to legends, one who knows Kabbalah and masters its secrets can control our world and the spiritual worlds that influence our world, revealing its past, present and future. <br /><br />Kabbalah is the science of the structure of the universe, the developmental laws of the spiritual worlds and our world, and the laws of man's purpose.<br /> <br />Kabbalah is a science of the impact of human desires on the surrounding world.<br /> <br />All Kabbalistic books are written in the language of feelings and desires. This language is unique and strictly scientific, employing graphs, formulae and diagrams. It explains how to alter our desires in order to purposefully influence the entire world. Through such graphs and schemes, Kabbalah describes one's feelings, the person's soul. Music also speaks to the person in a language of feelings and emotions, and as such, is close to Kabbalah.<br /> <br />What is music? It is an emotion captured in its evolvement. Only music can deliver the process of transforming feelings through time. That is why, to those who have not yet perceived the spiritual world, the music of Kabbalah provides a certain analogy of the impression of spirituality that is felt by the Kabbalist. <br /><br />The more evolved a person's feelings, the more one will delight in what is heard. In music, a sensitive person can open an entire world for themselves, undergoing different emotional states from bliss to tragedy. And the more one develops one's feelings, the more intricately he will sense that which the music transmits.<br /> <br />In much the same way, one who studies Kabbalah cultivates appropriate inner instruments for comprehending spirituality, through which spiritual information can be perceived. As a musician looks into notes and hears music through his- or her inner sensation, a Kabbalist, while reading Kabbalistic texts, senses the spiritual world within. <br /><br />A person's very first spiritual sensation when spirituality is revealed, is thankfulness to the Creator. One begins to sense this higher power and sees how it brought him out of a dead-end existence into an infinite, flawless world of absolute awareness and perfection. It is this sensation that Rav Baruch Ashlag (Rabash) transmitted through his music to the words of the psalm:<br /> <br />I thank you for saving my soul from death<br /> My eyes from tears<br /> My feet from entering hell.{% endraw %}
