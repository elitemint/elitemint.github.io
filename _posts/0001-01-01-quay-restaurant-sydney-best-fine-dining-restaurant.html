It’s located in the Overseas Passenger Terminal, with views of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. <br /><br /><br />Quay Restaurant is lead by Executive Chef Peter Gilmore who brings such a nature inspired cuisine to the scene. <br /><br />Now if you’ve heard of the infamous Snow Egg, you’ve definitely heard of the Quay Restaurant, also as being one of Sydney's best restaurant. This dish became famous in 2010 due to its feature on Masterchef however, on 1st April 2018, the Quay Restaurant closed for 3 months to go through a major renovation to its dining room, event spaces and kitchen, the first of this scale in the restaurant’s 30-year life.
