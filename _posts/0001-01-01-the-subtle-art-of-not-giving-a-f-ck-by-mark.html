{% raw %}The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck is a book about finding meaning in important things in life and only having those values that an individual can control. Whatever value (such as popularity) is not under a person's control,  a person should strive to replace it with something more controllable such as punctuality, honesty, or kindness.<br /><br />Manson further advises avoiding claiming certainty about the knowledge that is out of one's grasp and not worry about leaving a legacy for posterity. Instead of worrying about building a body of work as a legacy, one should seek to create joy at the moment for one's self and those around.<br /><br />ðŸ””ðŸ”” Subscribe and turn on notifications to stay updated with the latest uploads.<br /><br />#Audiobooks <br />#Bookclub <br />#Thesubtleartofnotgivingaf<br />#Thesubtleartofnotgivingaf*ck<br /><br />We do not own this audiobook.
