{% raw %}In this video I briefly explain the key benefits to nasal or nose breathing versus mouth breathing. It really does matter to our health if we breathe in through our mouth or nose because our nose is designed for breathing not our mouth. Mouth breathing leads to over breathing and too much oxygen in your blood stream which leads to oxidative stress that can result in neurodegenerative disorders, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, ageing, inflammation, anxiety and depression. In children mouth breathing changes the position of the jaw (and therefore facial structures), makes teeth crooked, dries the mouth's saliva which ordinarily protects you from tooth decay and gum disease, and may lead to sleeping disorders. Although this video does not focus on children I wanted to share the above written additional information with my viewers.<br /><br />To know more about Soma breathwork that can enhance physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing please visit my website <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lenabahou.com/soma-breath/">https://lenabahou.com/soma-breath/</a><br /><br />If you enjoyed the video please leave a comment and subscribe to my channel.{% endraw %}
