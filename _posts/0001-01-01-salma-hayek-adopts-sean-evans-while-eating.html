{% raw %}Salma Hayek is an Academy Award-nominated actress and film producer who has been a leading box-office draw for decades—from Desperado to Frida, to The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard and many more. Her latest is the highly anticipated Marvel Studios release Eternals, which is set to hit theaters on November 5th. But how is she with spicy food? Find out as the Hollywood icon takes on the wings of death and adopts Sean as an honorary Mexican for his spice tolerance. Along the way, she discusses movie-business economics, explores the connection between Frida Kahlo and string theory, and describes a close encounter with an octopus. <br /><br /><br />MAKE A DIFFERENCE BY DONATING TO COMMON THREADS, THE BRAND-NEW CHARITY PARTNER OF HOT ONES: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.commonthreads.org/firstwefeast/">https://www.commonthreads.org/firstwefeast/</a><br />BUY HOT ONES TRUTH OR DAB THE GAME NOW: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://truthordabgame.com">http://truthordabgame.com</a><br />BUY HOT ONES HOT SAUCE NOW: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3C0AilQ">https://bit.ly/3C0AilQ</a><br />HOT ONES MERCH AVAILABLE NOW: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2AIS271">https://bit.ly/2AIS271</a><br />SIGN UP FOR THE HOT ONES MONTHLY HOT SAUCE SUB BOX: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2veY50P">https://bit.ly/2veY50P</a><br />SIGN UP FOR THE FIRST WE FEAST NEWSLETTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://firstwefeast.com/signup">http://firstwefeast.com/signup</a><br /><br />Subscribe to First We Feast on YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/UxFzhK">http://goo.gl/UxFzhK</a><br /><br />Check out more of First We Feast here:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://firstwefeast.com/">http://firstwefeast.com/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/firstwefeast">https://twitter.com/firstwefeast</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/FirstWeFeast">https://www.facebook.com/FirstWeFeast</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/firstwefeast">http://instagram.com/firstwefeast</a><br /><br />First We Feast videos offer an iconoclastic view into the culinary world, taking you behind-the-scenes with some of the country’s best chefs and finding the unexpected places where food and pop culture intersect.<br />#Eternals #HotOnes{% endraw %}
