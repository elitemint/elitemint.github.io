{% raw %}One way to figure out how a chord will sound is to look at which other chords have the same notes, but what happens when chords that are supposed to be similar refuse to share? The best example of this is the Chromatic Mediant, two chords that seem like they should be mostly the same, but with some changes made to their common tones to push them a little further apart. They're a great tool for both functional and non-functional harmony, giving you a sound that's simultaneously connected and detached, smooth yet bold, and they just sound great. Plus there's something called a hexatonic pole!<br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/12tonevideos">https://www.patreon.com/12tonevideos</a><br />Mailing List: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://eepurl.com/bCTDaj">http://eepurl.com/bCTDaj</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/12tonevideos">https://www.facebook.com/12tonevideos</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/12tonevideos">https://twitter.com/12tonevideos</a><br />Email: 12tonevideos@gmail.com<br /><br />Last: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/4FNWQSGZQTw">https://youtu.be/4FNWQSGZQTw</a><br />Chords video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/e3BDLZFIMQs">https://youtu.be/e3BDLZFIMQs</a><br />Chord Functions video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Ot_lbUcb-uE">https://youtu.be/Ot_lbUcb-uE</a><br /><br />Huge thanks to our gold-level Patreon supporters:<br /><br />Ron Jones<br />Jill Jones<br />Susan Jones<br />Howard Levine<br />Elaine Pratt<br />Ken Arnold<br />Nakarin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jerom09666">https://www.youtube.com/user/jerom09666</a><br />Mark Yachnin<br /><br />And thanks as well to Henry Reich, José N., Logan Jones, Eugene Bulkin,  Abram Thiessen, Anna Work, Oliver, Jody, Jc Bq, Adam Neely, Jon I, David Zahara, nico, Mark Himmelberger, Chris Borland, Harold Gonzales, Lucas van Loomis, Alex Henson, jason black, and Dutreuilh Olivier!
