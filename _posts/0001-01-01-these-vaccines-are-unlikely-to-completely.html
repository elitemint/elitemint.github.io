They are very likely to have an effect which works in a %, say 60 or 70%.&quot; Believe him, someone who has these levels of credentials doesn't misspeak without correcting himself. <br /><br />Sterilization: 1.The process of making something free from bacteria or other living microorganisms.<br />Microorganisms can be bacteria, fungi, archaea or protists. The term microorganisms does not include viruses and prions, which are generally classified as non-living. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.uib.no/en/geobio/56846/what-are-microorganisms#:~:text=Microorganisms%20can%20be%20bacteria%2C%20fungi,in%20the%20study%20of%20microorganisms.">https://www.uib.no/en/geobio/56846/what-are-microorganisms#:~:text=Microorganisms%20can%20be%20bacteria%2C%20fungi,in%20the%20study%20of%20microorganisms.</a><br /><br />I am sure any infertility will be blamed on the virus . <br /><br />Will they blame infertility on Covid19?

This is where immune cells can bind to the virus to prevent it from entering cells where it can start to replicate. So even six weeks after receiving the first jab, you may still get infected with the coronavirus – even if you don’t get sick.<br /><br />Studies from the preclinical phase of the Oxford vaccine found that rhesus macaques that were immunised with the vaccine were protected from serious disease and had no evidence of lung damage. But they still had coronavirus infection in their upper-respiratory tract and virus shedding from their noses. If this is the same with humans, it would suggest that while they will be protected from symptomatic disease, they might still spread the virus.&quot;  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://theconversation.com/pfizer-vaccine-has-just-been-approved-heres-what-the-next-few-months-will-look-like-150790">https://theconversation.com/pfizer-vaccine-has-just-been-approved-heres-what-the-next-few-months-will-look-like-150790</a> <br /><br />6, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bionews.org.uk/page_152485">https://www.bionews.org.uk/page_152485</a><br /><br />&quot;I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see.
