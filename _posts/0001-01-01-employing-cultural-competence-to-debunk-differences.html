{% raw %}Introducing herself became a geography lesson for Ninah-Miriam Kiraya Dickson, an international student in the United States from Tanzania. Navigating cultural differences and developing cultural competence has become a strength for Ninah-Miriam. Cultural competence begins with growing our awareness of our biases. Ninah-Miriam shares how she has confronted her own biases and challenges others to confront their own to become more culturally aware and competent as they navigate a diverse world. <br /><br /> Ninah-Miriam Dickson Kiraya was born and raised on the outskirts of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. Ninah-Miriam is currently an International Student at Queens University in Charlotte where she is a recipient of the Presidential Scholarshipâ€“ the highest scholarship at Queens based on high academic and leadership achievement.

Through educational exhibitions, such as travelling to the University of Oxford, and several immersion trips to multiple countries in both Africa and Europe, Ninah-Miriam has expanded her ideas and perspectives of the world. Additionally, Ninah-Miriam attended the United World College of East Africa in Moshi, Tanzania.
