{% raw %}Here are the 7 things that women don’t understand men:<br /><br />1. Why our urine sometimes ends up on the floor, or on the outer edges of the toilet bowl.<br />2. Why a man will take a woman's number and then never call her.<br />3. Why most men usually prefer to decide on a solution or just fix a problem, rather than spending a lot of time talking about the feelings associated with it. <br />4. A lot of men are confused about women's apparent lack of attraction for them.<br />5. A secret reason why men won't commit. <br />6. Why a man can be very attracted to a woman, but not make a move when she shows signs of interest. <br />7. Why so many guys think that being 'nice' is what will make a woman want them. <br /><br />If both men and women understood each other’s behavior better, there’d be so many less rejections, breakups and divorces in this world. <br /><br />Men and women would understand that the intentions of the other are usually good and are not something to become angry, or bitter about. <br /><br />Yes, there are differences between men and women, but that is a big part of what creates the attraction and keeps things interesting.<br /><br />I hope this video helps women understand some important things about men’s behavior, which then leads to women feeling more at peace and more aware of why certain things happen. <br /><br />For the men: I also hope that you understand some of the reasons why women do the things they do and then realize that they aren’t as cold, indifferent or difficult as you may have once assumed. <br /><br />The reality is that it is EASY to attract, have sex with or get into a relationship with a woman you find very attractive. <br /><br />If you want to learn exactly how to do it, I recommend that you read The Flow or listen to The Flow on Audio.<br /><br />The Flow eBook:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.themodernman.com/blog/the-flow-ebook.html">https://www.themodernman.com/blog/the-flow-ebook.html</a><br /><br />The Flow on Audio:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.themodernman.com/blog/the-flow-on-audio.html">https://www.themodernman.com/blog/the-flow-on-audio.html</a><br /><br />The Flow is the easiest way to get laid or get a girlfriend. <br /><br />If you want to learn how to keep a relationship together for life, I recommend that you watch or listen to Make Her Love You For Life:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.themodernman.com/blog/make-her-love-you-for-life.html">https://www.themodernman.com/blog/make-her-love-you-for-life.html</a><br /><br />In the program, you will learn exactly how to make a woman feel sexually attracted to you, respect you and be totally in love with you when in a relationship.<br /><br />To your success with women!<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Dan Bacon<br />Founder, The Modern Man<br />Secrets to Success with Women <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.themodernman.com/">https://www.themodernman.com/</a>{% endraw %}
