{% raw %}The Andrews government has been ordered to reveal the secret documents that helped shape decisions to enter lockdown.<br /><br />The Department of Health is considering releasing the advice which has been used to justify the lockdowns.<br /><br />For the first time, Victoria’s privacy watchdog has forced the department to release 100 pages of documents and briefings.<br /><br />This request is focussed on the February lockdown from earlier this year but could be used to review each of Victoria’s six lockdowns. <br /><br />Melbourne is the most locked-down city in the world, but even domestically, those in Victoria have had much less freedom than New South Wales - even when case numbers were similar.{% endraw %}
