{% raw %}We test the new Mitsubishi Outlander 2.5L and see what this midsize SUV is like to drive.<br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3fnfVTQ">https://bit.ly/3fnfVTQ</a> | Visit Chasing Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2DpFZQP">https://bit.ly/2DpFZQP</a><br /><br />It’s the brand new Mitsubishi Outlander, and we’ve driven it extensively in town and country! It looks far more sophisticated outside, the interior is a huge upgrade, and it’s pretty affordable. So, what is the catch with the 2022 Outlander? Well, it comes down to the driving experience in today's Chasing Cars review, hosted by Tom Baker.<br /><br />Designed to compete with everything from the Toyota RAV4 to the Mazda CX-5 and even CX-8, the seven-seat Outlander is now based on the next-gen Nissan X-Trail CMF-CD platform, and uses the Nissan 2.5-litre naturally aspirated petrol four-cylinder. Later, a new Outlander plug in hybrid will arrive for Australia.<br /><br />Is this the best-value seven-seat family SUV on the market? <br /><br />Please consider subscribing and joining our Chasing Cars community!<br /><br />Time codes:<br />0:00 - What is the Mitsubishi Outlander?<br />1:50 - Interior in black leatherette/suede<br />5:19 - Back seats<br />6:52 - Boot space<br />8:26 - Running costs<br />9:53 - What is the Outlander 2.5 like to drive?<br />22:12 - Mitsubishi Outlander expert verdict{% endraw %}
