{% raw %}This is a trailer for the documentary film A GASP For Clean Air. <br /><br /><br /><br />Forty years ago, a public health crisis in Birmingham caused by unchecked air pollution motivated a group of young citizens and their allies to act. They organized and formed GASP (Greater Birmingham Alliance to Stop Pollution) and began to advocate for cleaning up the air. Inspired by the passage of the Clean Air Act, the first Earth Day and a desire for change, they succeeded in shaking up the seemingly impenetrable establishment and they paved the way for a healthier, cleaner community. <br /><br /><br /><br />For the 40th Anniversary of the Clean Air Act we honor the efforts and accomplishments of those who fought for healthy air forty years ago, and recognize there is still work to be done.{% endraw %}
