This is part 3 of 3, the final part! Making a video game has been harder than the Nerd and even the developer thought. But, while that process rushes to the deadline, the Nerd will review the last batch of LJN games to complete their awful catalog. These being the wrestling and miscellaneous games.<br /><br />PART 1:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/a9io5dyRvmI">https://youtu.be/a9io5dyRvmI</a><br />PART 2:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/JvHtXn7uQ6I">https://youtu.be/JvHtXn7uQ6I</a><br />PART 3:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Sqif27k-_Hg">https://youtu.be/Sqif27k-_Hg</a><br /><br />Download the Back to the Future fake NES game made by Sam:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://files.cinemassacre.com/avgn200/AVGN%20Episode%20200%20-%20Mock%20BTTF%20Game%20by%20Sam%20Beddoes.zip">https://files.cinemassacre.com/avgn200/AVGN%20Episode%20200%20-%20Mock%20BTTF%20Game%20by%20Sam%20Beddoes.zip</a><br /><br />Sam Beddoes as the Game Designer:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://freakzonegames.com/">https://freakzonegames.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FreakZoneGames">https://twitter.com/FreakZoneGames</a><br />(He also did the background music!)<br />(AND designed the real AVGN video games!!)<br /><br />End scene music by Andreas Hedlund:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.komposition.se">http://www.komposition.se</a><br /><br />End credit music by Epic Game Music:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj4v0IU9lTPzpfm0T3NF1hQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj4v0IU9lTPzpfm0T3NF1hQ</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/epicgamemusic">https://twitter.com/epicgamemusic</a><br /><br />Written by James Rolfe:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/cinemassacre">https://twitter.com/cinemassacre</a><br /><br />Editing and Producing:<br />Justin Silverman: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://justysilverman.com">http://justysilverman.com</a><br />Kieran: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/kieeeeern">https://www.twitch.tv/kieeeeern</a><br /><br />Opening Narration by Shane from Rerez:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/RerezTV">https://twitter.com/RerezTV</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoFpRCAsKfWAshvLE1bYzdw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoFpRCAsKfWAshvLE1bYzdw</a><br /><br />For everything else Cinemassacre:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cinemassacre.com/">https://cinemassacre.com/</a><br /><br />Little disclaimer: This episode was split into 3 parts because it's runtime is over an hour long in total. This made it easier to edit as we go. Also, Episode 200 was not made to sell a video game. The BTTF game you see (made in Unity by Sam) is just a plot device and not a &quot;real&quot; releasable game. Regardless, Sam's Unity files will be put online for free at the end of the 200 saga, next week. However, there is an upcoming 8-Bit NES AVGN game coming late next year, but it is completely unrelated to these episodes. Sorry if anyone was a little confused!<br /><br />#AngryVideoGameNerd #LJN #AVGN200 #Cinemassacre{% endraw %}
