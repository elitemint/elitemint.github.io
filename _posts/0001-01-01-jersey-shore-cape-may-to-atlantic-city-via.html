Geographically, the term encompasses about 141 miles (227 km) of oceanfront bordering the Atlantic Ocean, from Perth Amboy in the north to Cape May Point in the south. The region includes Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean, Atlantic, and Cape May counties, which are in the central and southern parts of the state. The Jersey Shore hosts the highest concentration of oceanside boardwalks in the United States.<br /><br />- Wikipedia<br /><br />Learn more at<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_Shore">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_Shore</a><br /><br /><br />Map data credit: Â© OpenStreetMap contributors<br />* The information presented in the overlay of the video is for demonstration purpose only.<br /><br />00:00:00 Cape May, Jersey Shore<br />00:12:41 Wildwoods, Jersey Shore<br />00:29:29 Stone Harbor, Avalon, Jersey Shore<br />00:47:33 Sea Isle City, Strathmere, Jersey Shore<br />01:01:49 Ocean City, Jersey Shore<br />01:25:04 Atlantic City, Jersey Shore{% endraw %}
