{% raw %}A Toyota Master Diagnostic Technician shares the truth about Lexus. Are they worth their high cost? Are they just glorified Toyota Models? What's good and what's bad about Lexus.<br /><br />So Should you buy a Lexus? This video happens to be the first of many videos on my channel as a new initiative to be more inclusive to Lexus models on my channel! This comes by request of the Car Care Nut awesome community!<br /><br />So in the first section of this video, We will take a trip down memory lanes to look at the humble beginnings of Lexus. How they started and what kind of impact they did that believe it or not changed the entire trajectory of the luxury car market.<br /><br />Then we're going to dive into the first conversation. Are Lexus models basically a Toyota with some fake leather and a higher price? The jury is still out on this one but in this video I give you the truth from experience.<br /><br />Then we're going to set the record straight for who should and shouldn't buy a Lexus. The worst thing that could ever happen to a car buyer is to pay a small fortune for a car then dislike it after 2 weeks. I hope this video will give you a better insight as to what to expect when you buy a Lexus so you can decide if you Should or Should NOT buy a Lexus.<br /><br />Folks, No company is perfect. Lexus included! In a later part of the video I will cover somethings that Lexus gets so wrong and this is recent! Then we will cover the &quot;test results&quot; of the Lexus LFA. Many say the Lexus LFA was a muscle flex exercise from Toyota\Lexus to show the world that they can be serious about performance. I have a different opinion about this which you might find interesting I hope!<br /><br />@Lexus if you are watching, Keep up the good work and keep making fabulous cars! <br /><br />Follow the channel on Social Media :<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/thecarcarenut">http://www.facebook.com/thecarcarenut</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/thecarcarenut">http://www.instagram.com/thecarcarenut</a><br /><br />Check out the channel Merch store<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEKt2bUDBoRUw3wpPpDOUaA/store">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEKt2bUDBoRUw3wpPpDOUaA/store</a><br /><br />Support the channel on Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/thecarcarenut">http://www.patreon.com/thecarcarenut</a><br /><br />Make a one time donation to the channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.paypal.me/CCNdonate">http://www.paypal.me/CCNdonate</a><br /><br />Check out the amazon store:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/shop/thecarcarenut">http://www.amazon.com/shop/thecarcarenut</a><br />*as an Amazon associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.<br /><br />#thecarcarenut #lexus #toyota<br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />0:44 Lexus History<br />6:55 So is Lexus just a Glorified Toyota?<br />13:11 Should you buy a Lexus?<br />14:55 Things Lexus doesn't do well especially Today!<br />21:34 Lexus LFA test results?{% endraw %}
