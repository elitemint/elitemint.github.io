{% raw %}It's a bright, beautiful summer day as you take the woodland path to the valley's resident carpenter. You enjoy the journey, the songbirds flying above and trains whistling through the mountains. Her cabin expertly and lovingly crafted by her own hands- a humble testament to the skill in her craft. A skill you are eager to call on as you ready your inherited farm with the blueprints of your dreams. <br /><br /><br />---<br />PEEP OUR PATREON ♫꒰･◡･๑꒱<br />If you enjoy the channel, check out our Patreon where you can get early access, exclusive audios, and more!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/AlternateAurora">https://www.patreon.com/AlternateAurora</a><br /><br />POUR ME A COFFEE  ( ^-^)_旦”” <br />If you liked my video, consider tipping me with a coffee!
