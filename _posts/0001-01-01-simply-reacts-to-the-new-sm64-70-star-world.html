{% raw %}If you didn't know, Weegee is the WR holder for both 70 star and 16 star SM64 speedruns. How does he do it?

Weegee SM64 speedrunning is crazy. Now that Weegee mario 64 holds both the 16 star WR and the 70 star WR, what will he speedrun next? Or will a new speedrun skip change mario 64 speedrunning? Or will Emiru speedrun Mario 64 faster than anyone and grab the 16 star WR? I think Mizkif mario speedruns will be the world record. Mizkif throwing his controller will accidently press all the buttons and get the mario 64 world record. If that happens, Simplyn64 will be reactioning to mario. Simply ignores girl and speedruns mario instead like a chad. Simply speaks about the Emiru Drama and gets mad about some chips LOL.{% endraw %}
