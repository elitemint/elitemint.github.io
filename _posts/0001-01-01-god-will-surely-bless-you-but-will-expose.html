{% raw %}Sometimes, people make your life miserable, they are out to see that nothing good ever happens to you and when you are about to get something, they will do of people are called enemies of progress, they want to see you suffer. God is going to contend with them, they are going to reap the fruit of their labor and they will never see anything good in their life. But if you want God to do this for you, you have to ensure that you have a good relationship with him and how can you have a good relationship with him? It is by leaving a life of Holiness and righteousness, you have to do away with anything that is against the will of God. Our God is too pure and holy to behold darkness and sin is the only thing that can hinder us from the love of the father. <br /> Do not think that God is not aware of the persecution you are going through in the hands of your enemies, do not be discouraged, God has a perfect time for everything, he sees the end from the beginning and he knows the exact time to bless you. I want you to understand that the ways of God is totally different from human comprehension but when he finally chooses to speak, every knee bows and tongues confess that he is Lord.<br />You will surely have the last laugh, you will walk in the valley of the shadow of darkness, and you will fear no evil because the Lord will be with you. I want you to know that you will live to see the reward of the wicked, you will know that it is good to serve God. All those that have treated you will come back and fall at your feet, they will be covered in shame because God will not allow them win over you. You are blessed, you are favored and you are more than a conqueror, the Lord is your light and salvation therefore you will never be defeated, your enemies will have no choice than to be at peace with you because the Lord will frustrate their efforts over your life.<br />We don’t always have people in our lives who can inspire us to follow our dreams. Fortunately, we can reflect on the wise words of others, and these ideas can serve as teachers that motivate us to chase after our goals and desires.<br />You have to chase your dreams, no matter what. The impossible just takes a little longer. One stroke at a time, one step at a time, the impossible is easy to achieve. <br /><br />Please don't forget to subscribe,like and share to support us <br />➽An original production of Truly Transformed{% endraw %}
