{% raw %}Episode 109<br />Released on: November 25, 2021<br /><br />Show Notes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://6figureauthors.com/podcast/10-ways-to-make-sure-your-novel-bombs/">https://6figureauthors.com/podcast/10-ways-to-make-sure-your-novel-bombs/</a><br /><br />It’s Thanksgiving week here in the US, so Lindsay, Andrea, and Jo just did a short “for fun” show this week. We give some tongue-in-cheek advice on how to make sure your novel bombs (that’s code for some mistakes we’ve made and seen others make that you should avoid!). Hopefully, you’ll find it vaguely helpful or at least entertaining!<br /><br />Reminder: you’ve got a few more days to pick up the NaNoWriMo StoryBundle with lots of books on writing, publishing, and marketing including Killer Content by our own Andrea Pearson.<br /><br />Thanks for listening, and thanks to Joshua Pearson for producing the show. Happy Thanksgiving!{% endraw %}
