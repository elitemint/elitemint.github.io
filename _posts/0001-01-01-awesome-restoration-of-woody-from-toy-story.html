{% raw %}Full restoration of Woody from Toy Story. I will repair this crazy Zombie edition of the beloved doll from the classic movie Toy Story 2 from the year of 1999.<br /><br />The restores tool chest that I use in this video<br />In this video I use an almost identical copy of the famous restores tool chest used in the original movie Toy Story 2 produced by Pixar animation studios back in 1999. I got this tool chest from another very skilled woodworker and YouTuber named Matthew Moustache. You can see him create the beautiful tool chest here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iHCl8DF48w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iHCl8DF48w</a><br /><br />The restoration process<br />I started disassembling the Woody doll by taking of all his clothes. One foot was really burned, so I had to use the heat blower to get off his cowboy boots. I took the Zombie head off and placed it on a scary looking home build platform which is a reference to one of Sid Phillips toys from the original Toy Story 2 movie.<br /><br />I pulled out all the U nails and the metal plate who was melted into Woodys head. I did a short sandblasting and I used baking soda as sandblasting media to avoid destroying the soft plastic on his head. I cleaned all the holes and made some reinforcements with wood and tiny nails, so I  could sculp a new strong and lasting face with clay. I used air drying silky doll clay to sculp and repair Woodys face.<br /><br />I used a lot of time filling, grinding and shaping the face. I painted him using my airbrush with many layers of acrylic water-based hobby paint. I mixed a custom skin color who is slightly darker than the original color and I also painted his hair and eyebrows a bit darker that the original Woody. I printed the eye color with my color printer and glued the paper onto his eyes.<br /><br />Buzz Lightyear made a new cowboy belt buckle for his friend. And this ended up really cool. I washed all his clothes in my mini washing machine and bought some second-hand boots on e-bay to replace to old burned ones.<br /> <br />It was a very challenging restoration and a hard job making the face look real again. I was aiming for the face shape and cool expression that Woody have in Toy Story 2 movie. And I think that I succeeded very good with the face repair job.  <br /><br />I really liked this restoration and I hope that you enjoy this video.
