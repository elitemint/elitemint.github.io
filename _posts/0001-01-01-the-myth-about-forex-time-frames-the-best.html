Typically, forex timeframes will be measured in minutes, hours, days or weeks. You will choose the timeframe that is most suited to your trading strategy.<br /><br />Once you’ve done your market research and know which type of trader you intend to be, you can start to trade forex using timeframe analysis. This will allow you to open a position during forex market opening hours, and work within a specific timeframe to exercise your plan.<br /><br />What forex timeframe should I trade?<br />There is a direct correlation between different forex timeframes and trading styles. But if you are wondering which timeframe is the best for forex trading, first you need to know what type of trader you want to be. Some traders – such as scalpers – work within very short timeframes; while others trade across a longer period of time. The best forex timeframes to trade will depend up on the type of trading style you choose.<br /> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />⚠️ NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE DISCLAIMER: <br />This video is for educational purposes only.
