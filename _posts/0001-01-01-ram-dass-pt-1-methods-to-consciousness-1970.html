{% raw %}Ram Dass discusses the Western illusion of thinking that we always need to &quot;do&quot; something. When we learn to use that same energy to work on ourselves then we automatically change our surrounding environment. Through the method of Upaya, we use our senses to go beyond our senses. The illusion is transcended by the illusion itself.  (4/18/1970 - Dublin, NH - Cumbres Growth Centre){% endraw %}
