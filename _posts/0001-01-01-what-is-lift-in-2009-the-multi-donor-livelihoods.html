{% raw %}In 2009, the multi-donor Livelihoods and Food Security Trust Fund (LIFT) was launched to tackle the issue of poverty and hunger directly in Myanmar's rural communities. In line with Millennium Development Goal 1 -- to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger -- LIFT's work focuses on improving food and livelihood security in six areas around the country where poverty is of particular concern. Learn more about LIFT's work in Myanmar at www.lift-fund.org. #Myanmar #PovertyReduction #RuralDevelopment #Liftfund #UNOPSMyanmar<br /><br />This video, which was filmed in the Delta and produced by Bridge features beneficiaries of financial inclusion and nutrition, and shows LIFT's strategy in action with poverty reduction in Myanmar.{% endraw %}
