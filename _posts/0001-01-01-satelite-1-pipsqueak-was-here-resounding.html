{% raw %}SATelite is a series of exhibitions by Amsterdams finest street artists. For this very first edition we invited Pipsqueak Was Here!!! to release some of their live painting magic on a set of glossy white Raumfeld wireless HiFi speakers.<br /><br />The 'Resounding From a Nearby Wall' exhibition is a selection of Pipsqueaks best and most recent works and now also contains a custom painted set of Raumfeld Stereo L. The show will be on display until September 5 2016 at Teufel Raumfeld in Van Baerlestraat Amsterdam.<br /><br />SATelite is curated by Street Art Today and kindly hosted by Teufel Raumfeld.<br /><br />www.streetart.today<br />www.teufelaudio.nl<br /><br />----<br /><br />Credits<br /><br />Video: Nicky Regelink<br />Soundtrack: Daniel Zuur aka Kraut - Lentamente ft.
