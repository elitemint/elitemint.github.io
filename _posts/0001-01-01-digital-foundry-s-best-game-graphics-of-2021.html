{% raw %}Join Alex Battaglia and John Linneman for an extended discussion on the best game graphics of 2021. There've been some amazing visuals this year - remarkable achievements from the first year of the 'next-gen' consoles, and all delivered in the Covid era, no less. Please note: Flight Simulator would definitely have made the list, but remember that it was first released in 2020 - and we talked about it in depth in the Best Game Graphics of 2020!<br /><br />Join the DF Patreon for pristine video downloads, behind the scenes content, early access to DF Retro, early access to DF Direct Weekly and much, much more: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3jEGjvx">https://bit.ly/3jEGjvx</a><br /><br />Subscribe for more Digital Foundry: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/DFSubscribe">http://bit.ly/DFSubscribe</a><br /><br />Want some DF-branded tee-shirts, mugs, hoodies or pullovers?
