{% raw %}The first recorded use of a so-called ‘dashcam’ was way back in the 1930s. The beauty of this footage is that it really gives us a unique perspective as you ride along as if we were actually behind the wheel or a passenger in the vehicle. Often the footage isn’t anything that would surprise anyone. But other times, it’s downright strange. You’re not going to know what to believe! Just keep these dashcams rolling because we never want to miss out on sweet moments like these! Right? So have a look!
