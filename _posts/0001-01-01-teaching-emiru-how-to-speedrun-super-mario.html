{% raw %}Mizkif has challenged Emiru to beat his SM64 16 Speedrun time, with the prize being one of Mizkif's Nintendo 64 boxes. Can I teach Emiru enough speedrunning strategies to help her win, or will Mizkif interrupt and need attention?<br /><br />tune into the tournament here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/simply">https://twitch.tv/simply</a><br /><br />merch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://simply64store.com/">https://simply64store.com/</a><br />twitch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/simply">https://twitch.tv/simply</a><br />twitter ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64">https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64</a><br />soundcloud ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/simply64">https://soundcloud.com/simply64</a><br /><br />Edited by eriksenchee<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/eriksenchee">https://twitter.com/eriksenchee</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Simply teaches @Emiru  Super Mario 64 Speedrunning techniques, with the goal being to beat @Mizkif 's personal best. Both are currently playing 16 star, however I run the 120 Star catagory. Mizkif plays SM64, meaning I won't get kicked out of the Austin, TX house anytime soon. Mizkif emiru speedrunning Mario 64 is basically what happens in this video. Do you think Mizkif and Emiru will start speedrunning 70 Star? Mizkif emiru mario content is cool, Emiru mizkif speedrun is also swag. How many times can I fit Mizkif speedruns mario while Mizkif and Emiru race sm64? I can fit a lot of Mizkif twitch and Emiru mario here. Mizzy wizzy and Stemiru.<br /><br />#mizkif #emiru #sm64{% endraw %}
