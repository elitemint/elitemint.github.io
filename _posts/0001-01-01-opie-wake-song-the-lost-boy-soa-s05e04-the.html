{% raw %}The Wake Song of Opie on Sons of Anarchy S05E04 - The Lost Boy - Greg Holden<br /><br />I left my home still as a child <br />I walked a thousand soary miles <br />To wait for my father, to gather up his truth <br /><br />He said my boy you've got to run <br />Don't wait for me, don't wait for mum <br />We'll come get you, when it's safe for us to move <br /><br />So I waited many years, <br />held back the pain behind my tears <br />For my father, to come find me like he said <br /><br />And in that time I was alone, <br />so many years without my home <br />I made brothers of a different kind instead <br /><br />[Instrumental break] <br /><br />And in the time I didn't know, <br />just how hard the wind could blow <br />Towards disaster, and the things that I would see <br /><br />I never found my father, <br />I never found my mother <br />Even would I know in my lifetime I will be <br /><br />A hero into the masses, <br />to those born without chances <br />There's a freedom that everyone deserves <br /><br />I know there's greed and there's corruption <br />I've seen death and mass destruction <br />But I'm telling you, and I hope that I'm heard <br /><br />And I will not be commanded, <br />And I will not be controlled <br />And I will not let my future go on, <br />without the help of my soul <br /><br />And I will not be commanded, <br />And I will not be controlled <br />And I will not let my future go on, <br />without the help of my soul <br /><br />And I will not be commanded, <br />And I will not be controlled <br />And I will not let my future go on, <br />without the help of my soul <br /><br />I will not be commanded, <br />I will not be controlled <br />And I will not let my future go on, <br />without the help of my soul{% endraw %}
