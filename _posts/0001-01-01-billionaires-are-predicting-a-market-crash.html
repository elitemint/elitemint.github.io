For hundreds of years, people have wondered about secret societies, mens clubs or grand conspiracies, and while the idea of the freemasons secretly controlling everything that happens isnâ€™t exactly mainstream today, few people would argue against the Billionaires of the world from having more information than the average joe. Even fewer would argue that the most successful people in the world, those who built their billion dollar fortunes themselves, are going to be less intelligent than you or I. Perhaps thatâ€™s sufficient justification then for us to pay attention to what they do. And while I personally donâ€™t subscribe to any grand notions of the illuminati or a worldwide elite with knowledge of exactly what is going to happen, I do think that if Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson start selling their stocks, thereâ€™s probably a reason why. Well, thatâ€™s exactly what is happening right now, some of the smartest, most successful people alive today, seem to be liquidating their positions, selling out of the stocks, and preparing for something, and thatâ€™s what weâ€™re going to be looking at today.<br /><br />DISCLAIMERS:<br />Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
