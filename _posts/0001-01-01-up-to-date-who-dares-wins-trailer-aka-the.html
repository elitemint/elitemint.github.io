{% raw %}I couldn't find the original but hope this is enjoyable for some people.  This 1982 film was inspired by the events of the Iranian Embassy siege that took place in London in 1980 and created huge public interest in the SAS in Britain.<br /><br />This was my favourite move growing up (not really a kids film!) and thought I would try out doing another trailer (see also my attempt at the Spy Who Loved Me).<br /><br />The dialogue is not great in this film and many pieces had to be edited to get them to make some sense.<br /><br />All copyrights belong to Universal Pictures and others{% endraw %}
