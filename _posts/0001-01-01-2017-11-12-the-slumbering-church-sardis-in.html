{% raw %}In today’s culture it's easy to put on a smile and act like everything is ok, when you are truly falling apart inside. We wear facades and put on plastic faces. Jesus calls out the church in Sardis for pretending to be alive when it was actually dying. This should serve as a powerful reminder to us all to keep alert or we can slowly fall into the trap of thinking that we are spiritually alive, when we are really dead.<br /><br />NEXT STEPS<br />Have you made a decision to follow Jesus? You may be wondering what’s next on your journey. We want to help!
