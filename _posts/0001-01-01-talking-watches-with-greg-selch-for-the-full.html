Well, you won't find him belting out this summer's hottest hit on Spotify, nor will he be sinking threes in the NBA. He works in the furniture business and once invested in a company hoping to revive the use of airships in commercial aviation.<br /><br />What he lacks in name recognition he makes up for in an all-star collection of vintage watches that most enthusiasts typically overlook. And he isn't just collecting – he's done quite a bit of scholarship around the watches, too.<br /><br />Years after meeting him, I finally had the chance to sit down with Selch and thoroughly discuss a few pieces from his collection of what he calls &quot;orphan watches,&quot; or to put it more generously, watches that don't have a large following. At least not yet.<br /><br />Watch the episode and see if he can convince you why they should.<br /><br />Follow HODINKEE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hodinkee/​">https://www.instagram.com/hodinkee/​</a><br />See more videos on our site: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hodinkee.com/videos​">https://www.hodinkee.com/videos​</a><br /><br />Download our podcasts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hodinkee.com/podcasts​">https://www.hodinkee.com/podcasts​</a><br />Shop for new watches and accessories: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.hodinkee.com​">https://shop.hodinkee.com​</a><br />Shop for vintage watches: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.hodinkee.com/collections​">https://shop.hodinkee.com/collections​</a><br /><br /><br />And don't forget to SUBSCRIBE to our channel, thank you!{% endraw %}
