{% raw %}Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts is now streaming on HBO Max. Review by Matt Fowler.<br /><br /><br /><br />Return to Hogwarts is a charming look back at a decade of Harry Potter movies, featuring headlining cast members, an inviting atmosphere, and a lot of love and laughter. It's also uniquely long for a reunion special, taking us through each movie in a way that may make for a slog, for some. To that end, it's also separated up into more-easily digestible chapters and segments, for pull-apart viewing if necessary. The end result though is a terrific roots-to-tips take on a delightful decade of movie-making.<br /><br />#IGN #HarryPotter{% endraw %}
