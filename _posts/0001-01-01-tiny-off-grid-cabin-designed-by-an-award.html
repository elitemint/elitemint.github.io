{% raw %}A tiny off grid cabin, Skylark Cabin embraces the incredible views afforded by its location. Barry Connor Design opens the cabin to the foothills of the Ben Ohau Mountain Range, establishing the residence as a dream home.  <br /><br />Settled into the rugged environment of Twizel, Canterbury, the tiny off grid cabin is under 50 square metres and under four metres in height. From the cabin tour, it becomes clear that the home has many features that make it a special addition to Airbnb. <br /><br />The architecture of Skylark Cabin encourages residents to enjoy the New Zealand landscape. Windows of various sizes throughout the home make for defined views of Backbone Peak and the Ben Ohau Range, whilst an open sightline from the bedroom to the reserve – passing through the living room – allows the tiny off grid cabin to borrow visual space from the outdoors. <br />Barry Connor Design ensures that the interior design of the tiny off grid cabin references the natural scenery. Sheets of beech plywood pull the colours of the surrounding landscape into the cabin, whilst a large skylight above the bed alludes to the night sky in oversized, telescopic fashion. <br /><br />By creating a tiny off grid cabin that bears witness to its ever-changing external environment, Barry Connor ensures that the experience of backcountry Ben Ohau Range is like no other. <br /><br />00:00 - The Local Project Print Publication  <br />00:20 - The Brief for the Architect<br />00:45 - The Location of the Off Grid Cabin<br />01:03 - The Layout of the Cabin<br />02:40 - The Exterior from the Street<br />03:00 - The Layout Continued<br />03:26 - The Weather and Environment Around the Cabin<br />04:08 - Using Orange on the Exterior <br />04:20 - The Exterior of the Off Grid Cabin<br />04:51 - The Skylight in the Bedroom <br />05:04 - The Outdoor Bath<br />05:55 - The Local Project Print Publication Continued <br /><br />For more from The Local Project: <br /><br />Instagram – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thelocalproject/">https://www.instagram.com/thelocalproject/</a> <br />Website – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/</a> <br />Print Publication – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/publication/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/publication/</a> <br /><br />To subscribe to The Local Project's Tri-Annual Print Publication see here – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/subscribe/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/subscribe/</a> <br /><br />Architecture and Interior Design by Barry Connor Design.<br />Photography by Lightforge Photography.<br />Filmed and Edited by Cadre Productions. <br />Production by The Local Project.<br /><br />#TinyOffGridCabin #Architecture #Cabin #InteriorDesign #NewZealand #CabinTour #DreamHome #AirBnB{% endraw %}
