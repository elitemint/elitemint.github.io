{% raw %}On this episode we get the incredibly rare opportunity to shoot with Kodak Instant Film, a product that has not been produced for 35 years and been considered completely defunct. This stunning working pack of film was acquired by a deceased Kodak employee who had been cold storing it, and then sent to us by Mike Thibault who discovered it was function and donated the final shots to the show. You can find Mike at @chronologeek.<br /><br />As always you can follow me on the gram @the.instantgram and support our Patreon at Patreon.com/inaninstantchannel<br /><br />While you're here, go ahead and slap that subscribe button, thanks!{% endraw %}
