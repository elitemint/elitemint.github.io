{% raw %}I GOT LUCKY!  2 Trains Pass On Steep Hill out of the Ohio River valley!    A Train Going Up A Steep Grade way up in the air over a Huge Railroad Trestle.  A heavy train went over a 2 track railroad crossing near the top of the hill and all of a sudden a 2nd train is blowing the horn and working hard to power a heavy mixed freight train.  Both trains passed right in front of me and just by luck I was on the best side of the tracks to film both trains.  A 3rd train passed me with an open boxcar door that Hobo Shoestring would have loved.  That train went down the hill and I could smell the brake shoes.  Then a maintenance of way grader went past and activated the crossing gates.  After that I went to a huge trestle that is half way up the hill between the Ohio River and Erlanger, Kentucky.  I heard a train approaching on 160.950 so I decided to film it high and dry crossing the valley.  There was nowhere to park so I decided to film it from my truck and move if a car came.  Almost all of the train passed before one car finally  came up behind me so I had to move.  There were maybe a dozen cars that I didn't get and it didn't have a DPU so I still did pretty good with it.  We also get to see a closeup of the rail and a few pieces of broken couplers that are laying around near the top of the grade.  This is an awesome video but I forgot to add Norfie and Chessie.  I don't know how that happened but they will return in the next video for sure.   Filmed January 4, 2022.
