This is typically used with reference to large companies and in regard to which people within that company are able to make agreements with others on behalf of that company. An employee for a large retailer at a cash register, for example, may not have actual authority to set prices for customers, but he or she may have an apparent authority to customers to be able to do so.{% endraw %}
