{% raw %}A very spacious 4 bedroom villa situated in La Alfoquia, near Zurgena.  The property is within easy walking distance of amenities, as well as the municipal swimming pool, and boasts a private garage. <br /><br />A pedestrian gate opens to a front terrace area, then the front door opens into the living/dining room.  This is a lovely sized room benefiting from a central log burner with marble surround as well as air conditioning.  From here there is access directly to the master bedroom which boasts air conditioning and an en-suite bathroom with bath.  A hallway leads away from the living room with the fully fitted kitchen immediately on the right.  This spacious kitchen, larger than most others on the development due to reconfiguration during the building phase, also benefits from a utility terrace which has been enclosed with fly screens.  <br /><br />The hall then continues to the second &amp; third bedroom on the right.  There is also a shower room on the left.  The fourth bedroom is found at the end of the hall and has direct access onto a private garden.  This garden area also has street access and is extremely private.<br /><br />Overall, this property is a very comfortable size for permanent living or it could be used as a spacious lock up and leave holiday home with little maintenance. <br /><br />The village of La Alfoquia is around 25 minutes from the coast of Mojacar.  This friendly little village, just a few minutes from Zurgena town, has amenities just a short stroll away.  The Spanish community spirit is very evident with a fantastic municipal outdoor pool and various bars just a 2 minute walk from the villa, along with brand new sports facilities.{% endraw %}
