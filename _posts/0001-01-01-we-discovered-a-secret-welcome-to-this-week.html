We're Nick and Terysa and we‚Äôve become completely obsessed with the idea of sailing around the world and sharing our experiences and information through our sailing lifestyle videos with others. <br /><br />We met travelling around India, and quickly agreed that rather than ‚Äúsettling down‚Äù and doing what most normal people do, we wanted to travel and adventure instead and started our sailing lifestyle adventure stories, since then, we‚Äôve been working hard towards achieving our dreams, and now we‚Äôre finally living them as sailing cruising lifestyle! <br /><br />Want to know anything about our sailing lifestyle or sailing adventure stories?
