{% raw %}The building construction division looks back on a long tradition at the Max Bögl Group. The family business was founded in 1929 as a bricklaying business. Around 90 years later, we offer our customers unique, specially developed “products” in system construction for halls and multi-storey car parks.<br /><br />In addition, we also offer a wide range of construction services and realise a wide variety of building types such as ultra-modern office buildings, inviting hotels or representative trade fair centres – turnkey or only as shell construction, with or without planning support.<br /><br />Learn more: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.max-boegl.de/en/range-of-services/building-construction">https://www.max-boegl.de/en/range-of-services/building-construction</a>{% endraw %}
