The move has been slated by many fans who believe it offers a stark contrast to previous statements made surrounding the game's monetization tactics.Marvel's Avengers' recent addition to Xbox Game Pass is likely to have brought a range of new players to the game. For pre-existing fans, however, news of the game's move to the new platform was shortly followed by the more troubling reality that its in-game marketplace now offers players the option to purchase boost-based 'consumables' using credits that can only be acquired through spending real money. As reported by VGC, the game's new consumables can be purchased to temporarily increase the amount of XP and resources that a player can acquire while playing the game. This essentially allows for fans to make faster progress - so long as they're happy to spend real money doing so.”<br /><br />From Ars Technica<br /><br />“The PC version of God of War, arriving on January 14, 2022, will retail for $49.99, and its Steam listing already includes some technical details as of Wednesday morning. The most interesting addition is entirely new for Sony Interactive Entertainment launches on PC: support for Nvidia's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) standard. <br /><br /><br />From Gaming Bible<br /><br />“Earlier this month, it was revealed that Sony will be dropping an extra three free PlayStation VR games for subscribers alongside the usual crop PS4 and PS5 games - but it’s now emerged that yet another bonus freebie will be available for a certain number of subscribers too.  You might remember that the free PS5 PS Plus game for April was Oddworld: Soulstorm, the latest entry in the long-running sci-fi puzzle platformer series.  Developer Oddworld Inhabitants has now announced that it’s releasing an improved and upgraded edition of the 2021 title, just months after its original release.  <br />Oddworld: Soulstorm - Enhanced Edition includes all previously released updates and fixes, plus tweaked gameplay mechanics and even some all-new content. It’s set to be the definitive way to play the game. Better yet, it’ll be completely free for anyone who owns the original - whether they purchased it or redeemed it back in April via PlayStation Plus.”<br /><br />From Push Square<br /><br />“Sony's currently catching some flak online for a patent that almost immediately sounds like a bad idea. Registered in January 2020 but approved only recently, the patent outlines a potential PlayStation feature that would allow streamers and their viewers (on streaming websites like Twitch, for example) to either temporarily or permanently remove players from multiplayer games. The patented and rather detailed flowchart shows the process of spectators deciding to remove (or &quot;bench&quot;) players who aren't pulling their weight. Players can also be sent messages telling them to play better, and there's even mention of viewers paying to have people kicked from the game. It all seems to come down to a voting system, which can be influenced by a player's supposed skill level. “<br /><br />From Comicbook<br /><br />“A new PS5 controller is releasing this holiday season, not from Sony though. For the PS5, Sony ditched the DualShock in favor of the DualSense, a fairly high-tech controller. However, it's not the perfect controller, and it's not the greatest controller for competitive gaming. Unfortunately, PlayStation still has no answer to the Xbox Elite Controller, Xbox's premium controller for Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S. This could change this holiday season though.  Over on Twitter, SCUF, experts in performance controllers, revealed that its next-gen controller for the PS5 is releasing sometime in the middle of November. Unfortunately, while we have a release window for the controller, we don't have an exact release date or pricing information.”{% endraw %}
