{% raw %}If you have a Truma AquaGo, and you RV during the winter, you may have heard of this device.  Truma sent us one, and I install it in this video.  I'll cover what it does, and what it doesn't do.  Perhaps more  importantly, I tell you how I see us using this device in the winter - and hopefully that will help you make an informed decision as to whether or not you need one for yourself.<br /><br />There are more tips and clarifications in the associated post on our website, here:  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thefitrv.com/rv-tips/the-truma-electric-antifreeze-kit-what-is-it/">https://www.thefitrv.com/rv-tips/the-truma-electric-antifreeze-kit-what-is-it/</a><br /><br />You can leave comments and ask questions there as well.<br /><br />--------------<br /><br /><br /><br />Want to support what we do ?<br /><br />You can do it for FREE by shopping on Amazon with this link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2i8oAw2">https://amzn.to/2i8oAw2</a><br /><br /><br /><br />--------------<br /><br /><br /><br />CONNECT WITH US<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thefitrv.com">https://www.thefitrv.com</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thefitrv">https://www.instagram.com/thefitrv</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/thefitrv">https://www.facebook.com/thefitrv</a><br /><br />Twitter:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/thefitrv">https://www.twitter.com/thefitrv</a>{% endraw %}
