{% raw %}The 'Living with multiple medicines' project is about people's experience of taking five or more medicines by seeing and hearing them share their personal stories on film. <br /><br />Our researcher travelled around Australia to talk to 40 people (including 5 doctors and 1 pharmacist) in their own homes or workplaces. <br /><br />The project was conducted at NPS MedicineWise using what is known as 'the DIPEx method', developed by the Health Experiences Research Group at the Department of Primary Care Health Sciences at the University of Oxford, and it was conducted with the support of DIPEx Australia.<br /><br />Find out about the project and watch all the videos at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://nps.org.au/living-with-multiple-medicines">http://nps.org.au/living-with-multiple-medicines</a>{% endraw %}
