{% raw %}Salmon croquettes<br />with potato coated in crunchy tortilla crumbs<br />Amazing salmon croquettes recipe made with flaked fresh salmon, always a popular meal with everyone. These salmon croquettes are super crunchy, as I used tortilla chips as part of the crumbs. If your looking for something kids and adults alike will love, then this salmon croquette recipe is definitely for you. An easy recipe to make using fresh salmon and make sure you buy starchy potatoes. You’ll need the skins off the salmon, so if buying look for skinless, otherwise it’s quite simple to remove yourself. Great served with a fresh crisp salad and a side of mayonnaise although I personally just prefer lemon juice, I want to taste all those great flavours.<br /><br />▶Get full recipe here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.recipe30.com">http://www.recipe30.com</a><br /><br /><br />Some of the products I use and recommend:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/recipe30">https://www.amazon.com/shop/recipe30</a>  (affiliate)<br /><br /><br />Send products or info to:<br /><br />MAILING ADDRESS<br />RECIPE30<br />PO BOX 416<br />MOUNT MARTHA 3934<br />VICTORIA AUSTRALIA<br /><br />Want to post me something?
