{% raw %}Today I visited NYC’s Indian and South Asian neighborhood of Jackson Heights to get an incredible, traditional Indian head massage. This is truly the king of barber massages and includes not just a regular head massage with oil but also a massage gun to the neck, a vibrator to the ear, and most shockingly of all, chiropractic (he cracked my neck)!
