{% raw %}Surprise Surprise on the day before Catherine‚Äôs Together at Christmas Carol Concert that she‚Äôs worked so hard on, Harry and Meghan release their Christmas card thus ensuring that the U.K. media would cover it the following day! It was pretty obvious they would do something! I was surprised we got to actually see the children‚Äôs faces in all honesty. <br /><br />That being said it‚Äôs a lovely photograph. I genuinely mean that. The children both look absolutely adorable! <br /><br />It‚Äôs been dissected on social media and a few have compared the pose of Meghan to that of Diana. What do you think?? <br /><br />Anyway you wonderful lot‚Ä¶ Merry Christmas üéÑ <br /><br />I hope you all have a lovely one ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è{% endraw %}
