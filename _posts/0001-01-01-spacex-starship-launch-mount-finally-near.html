{% raw %}SpaceX Starship LAUNCH MOUNT FINALLY Near Completion!<br /><br />Subscribe now with all notifications on for more Starship Updates, SpaceX news and Space news!<br /><br />SpaceX appears to have begun tying up a number of loose ends at Starship‚Äôs first orbital launch site, potentially setting the stage for major rocket testing CEO Elon Musk has stated could begin next month. Last but not least, SpaceX performed multiple tests of the pad‚Äôs ‚Äòorbital launch mount‚Äô ‚Äì the giant, steel structure that will support Super Heavy, hold the booster down during testing and before liftoff, and supply it with thousands of tons of propellant. <br /><br />On November 21st, SpaceX completed the first of those tests, seemingly venting an unknown gas out of the mount.  More likely than not, it was the first simultaneous test of all 20 of the mounts Raptor Boost engine gas supplies, which ‚Äì having no need to reignite in flight ‚Äì will rely on ground gas supplies for ignition. <br /><br />Each of Super Heavy‚Äôs 20 outer Raptor engines has a small umbilical and quick disconnect mechanism, resulting in what is likely the most mechanically complex rocket launch mount ever built. On November 22nd, the orbital launch mount‚Äôs booster quick disconnect panel actuated for the first time, showing off the first glimpse of how it will move forward, to connect to Super Heavy after a booster is installed on the mount. <br />#spacex #starship #spacexstarship<br />üì∫ Watch the entire video for more information!<br /><br />_________________________________________________________________<br /><br />About Science Of Space<br /><br />Listen to the world top thinkers in science, astronomy, cosmology, technology and futurism.<br /><br />So we are inviting you to join us in exploring Space, Rockets and Science and together we can conquer the unknown! &quot;Science Of Space!?&quot; <br />_____________________________________________________<br /><br />üíº Business Inquiries and Contact<br />‚Ä¢ For business inquiries, copyright matters or other inquiries please contact us at: . scienceofspace133@gmail.com<br /><br />‚ùì Copyright Questions<br />‚Ä¢ If you have any copyright questions or issues you can contact us at scienceofspace133@gmail.com<br /><br />‚ö†Ô∏è Copyright Disclaimers<br />‚Ä¢ We use images and content in accordance with the YouTube Fair Use copyright guidelines<br />‚Ä¢ Section 107 of the U.S. Copyright Act states: ‚ÄúNotwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.‚Äù <br />‚Ä¢ This video could contain certain copyrighted video clips, pictures, or photographs that were not specifically authorized to be used by the copyright holder(s), but which we believe in good faith are protected by federal law and the fair use doctrine for one or more of the reasons noted above.<br /><br />_____________________________________________________<br /><br />‚≠ê Credits:<br />SpaceX 3D Creation Eccentric : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/c/Spacex3DCreationEccentric">https://youtube.com/c/Spacex3DCreationEccentric</a><br />Evan Karen : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/c/EvanKaren">https://youtube.com/c/EvanKaren</a><br />TijnM : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/channel/UCDA8yz_nQY-0Uxd96-qxYjA">https://youtube.com/channel/UCDA8yz_nQY-0Uxd96-qxYjA</a>{% endraw %}
