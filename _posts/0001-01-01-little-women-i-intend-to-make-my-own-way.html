{% raw %}~Who am I and why should you subscribe to my channel?<br />First of, hello &amp; welcome :)<br />I'm Clémentine, 19 years old, from France. <br />If you're passionnate about cinema just like me, this channel is made for you! On this platform, I'm posting my multifandom movie edits regularly. You can also follow me on Instagram for inspirational movie quotes &amp; facts! @monapchosisproductions <br /><br /><br /><br />~What is this edit about? <br />Hello guys :)<br />Here's my newest edit. I was soooo inspired for this one! This time, I chose to edit the wonderful movie 'Little women' directed by Greta Gerwig and starring Saiorse Ronan (Jo March), Timothée Chalamet (Laurie), Florence Pugh (Amy march), Emma Watson (Meg March), Eliza Scanlen (Beth March) and Laura Dern (Marmee March) (along with others). I wanted to capture the warm, emotional, cosy and funny atmosphere of the movie along with the amazing strength and will of Meg, Amy, Beth and Jo and it seemed that Coldplay's 'Viva la vida' fitted perfectly for the task. I used Epic Orchestra's orchestral version (no kidding) of the song. I hope you will enjoy it! <br /><br />Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Olb1OtCOgAQ">https://youtu.be/Olb1OtCOgAQ</a> (all credits go to Epic Orchestra) <br /><br /><br />I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THIS.
