{% raw %}In this video recorded by Ross IELTS Academy, you will learn how to use and pronounce Quit Quiet and Quite in our daily English. <br /><br />What’s the difference between these three words?<br /> Well, obviously, the biggest one is how they are pronounced. “Quit”, “quite”, “quiet”. You should make sure to pronounce them correctly as one of the biggest mistakes is how everyone mispronounces them. <br />The next difference is what each word means, right?<br />Let’s start with the word “quit”. <br />For example:<br />I quit my house to go to work.<br />You can see me if you quit the office.<br />Here “quit” means that you leave a place, normally permanently, like quitting your house or office here.<br />However, “quit” has also got another meaning which is “to stop doing something”, like:<br />You should quit smoking or you will die very soon.<br />She decided to quit her job to follow her dreams.<br />Here, we are talking about “to stop smoking or working”.  <br /> <br />Now, the next word is “quite”. <br />Let’s look at an example:<br />The end of the movie was quite sad.<br />I am not quite ready for the test.<br />Quite means “to a certain extent”.<br /> <br />Now, the last word is “quiet” which of course you know the definition of.<br />For example:<br />You should be quiet when you are in a library. <br />The house was so quiet when my mom was sleeping.<br />The word “quiet” means “silent and calm” or when there is no noise.<br /> <br />#IELTSSPEAKING #IELTSvocabulary #QuitQuietQuite{% endraw %}
