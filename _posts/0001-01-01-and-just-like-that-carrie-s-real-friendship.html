{% raw %}In this clip: Sarita Choudhury and Sarah Jessica Parker<br /><br />Dedicatee: Willie Garson (1964-2021)<br /><br />About this clip: Carrie and Seema have an emotionally intense altercation with one another that devolves into the beginning of a real friendship. Carrie is angry and resentful when she sees that the glass of her picture-frame with Big lies broken. The broken glass touched by Big everyday is not replaceable to Carrie which prods Seema to reveal what nettled her about the otherwise supportive Carrie.<br /><br />The scene completes the three dyads of AJLT friendship and underscores the word &quot;real&quot; to emphasize how Carrie's relationship with a man was perhaps not authentic enough, more especially, in the light of the revelations about his personal life he seemed to live, apart from her. The last time we hear the word emphasized is when Carrie tells Aleksandr in Paris she needs &quot;real&quot; love. The SATC/AJLT narrative can then be seen as Carrie's journey to find real love and rejecting one reality for another that seems more existentially fulfilling.{% endraw %}
