{% raw %}I really don't know what to say - other than this truck is everything I have always wanted in an RC Trail Truck.  I have been in the Trail Truck game since.. well, I was one of the first.  I have seen them all - and this truck is amazing.  I don't even know IF ITS AVAILABLE yet in the west, as it is CURRENTLY ONLY SOLD IN CHINA.  I had this truck sent to me by Traction Hobby - and I have no idea how much it is retail - but ITS FRICKEN AMAZING. Its goes anywhere.. and the IFS (Independent Front Suspension) is truly remarkable. I ran this  on 4S lipo today, and this was the Maiden run. I thought it only appropriate to test the lights in WATER to see if it shorted out. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.tractionhobby.com/product/tank/show-98.html">http://www.tractionhobby.com/product/tank/show-98.html</a><br /><br />ONLY YOU CAN FIND OUT by WATCHING THIS VIDEO!<br /><br />What are your thoughts on this truck?
