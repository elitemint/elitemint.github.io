{% raw %}The Grasping Skills Exercise is fine motor activities that strengthen your baby’s hands, sharpen their eye-hand as well as bilateral hand coordination skills. Each child develops differently at his/her own rate. This video will serve as a guide. If you have questions or concerns, please contact your child’s occupational therapist.<br /><br />Ivonne Arias-Doppelhammer, an Occupational Therapist at Nicklaus Children's Hospital's Rehabilitation Department, explains the Grasping Skills Exercise. This tutorial video will teach you the proper technique and pacing of this exercise, so you can do it with your child as recommended in your child's treatment plan.<br /><br />Learn more about our physical therapy services by visiting: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nicklauschildrens.org/Rehab">https://www.nicklauschildrens.org/Rehab</a>{% endraw %}
