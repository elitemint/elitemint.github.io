{% raw %}With hundreds of thousands of creatures born in the world every day, the chances that there will be some born with a rare abnormality is inevitable. Sometimes it’s the very thing that makes the animal special. Still, scientists come across some weird, and sometimes creepy, animals while doing their research. Some of these animals are so rare, like a cyclops puppy, they don’t seem real. And some of these creatures were assisted by science, like with hybrid zebra horses, or pigs with perms. Either way, you won’t be able to unsee what we’re about to show you.
