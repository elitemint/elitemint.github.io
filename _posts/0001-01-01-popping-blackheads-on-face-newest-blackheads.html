These bumps are called blackheads because the surface looks dark or black. Blackheads are a mild type of acne that usually form on the face, but they can also appear on the following body parts. Acne affects nearly 50 million Americans and is the most common skin disorder in the United States, according to the American Academy of Dermatology.<br /><br />Blackheads form when a clog or plug develops in the opening of hair follicles in your skin. Each follicle contains one hair and a sebaceous gland that produces oil. This oil, called sebum, helps keep your skin soft. Dead skin cells and oils collect in the opening to the skin follicle, producing a bump called a comedo. If the skin over the bump stays closed, the bump is called a whitehead. When the skin over the bump opens, exposure to the air causes it to look black and a blackhead forms. Some people believe that what you eat or drink can affect acne. Dairy products and foods that increase blood sugar levels, such as carbohydrates, may play a part in triggering acne, but researchers arenâ€™t convinced that thereâ€™s a strong connection.<br /><br />Dermatologists or specially trained skin care professionals use a special instrument called a round loop extractor to remove the plug causing the blackhead. After a small opening is made in the plug, the doctor applies pressure with the extractor to remove the clog.<br /><br />ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ LIKE, COMMENT, SHARE &amp; SUBSCRIBE ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ{% endraw %}
