{% raw %}First And Foremost is a band out of Wichita, KS.  An amazing band... you can pick up the project that this song is from (the project is titled 'Once a Dull City') on iTunes at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/once-a-dull-city/id374950126">http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/once-a-dull-city/id374950126</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Here is commentary from the director, Justin Cary:<br /><br />First and Foremost is a local band in Wichita, KS that came to me with the idea of shooting a music video. We chose to shoot the video in an abandoned warehouse and to shoot live footage only. (It was freezing cold btw) The shoot ran about 5 hours and some change... quick and dirty in and out. If we were to reshoot this video I'd schedule a good 12-18 hours and plan 3x as many shots. Live and learn.  I shot it with a Canon 5DMkII and used the 50mm f/1.4 and 17-40mm f/4.0  Let me know what you think!<br /><br /><br /><br />This vid was not produced by GL Media Company... it is merely being shared thru Breathe Life Radio to expand the reach of the vid, the artist, and their message.{% endraw %}
