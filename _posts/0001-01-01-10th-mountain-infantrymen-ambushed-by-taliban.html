They take up what cover they can find while providing suppressing fire for the exposed soldiers behind them.<br /><br />They are able to get on a lateral line and identify and engage suspected enemy locations 50 meters to their front. Enemy rifle rounds repeatedly crack through the air, very near to the American troops. Approximately half way through the video, the camera is knocked down, but the remaining audio of gunfire and verbal communication allows the viewer to understand what is happening.{% endraw %}
