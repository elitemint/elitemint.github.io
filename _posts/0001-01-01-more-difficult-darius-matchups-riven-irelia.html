This time I went for the matchups you guys commonly asked for rather than going for what I thought would be the ones you guys struggled with the most. The last matchup video I did not only performed extremely well, but also helped a lot of you guys as I had many people in the comments, discord, twitch chat and etc. come up and tell me that the video won them their lane on multiple occasions which is pretty great. <br /><br />This time we are going to be taking a look at the Darius vs Riven, Darius vs Fiora and Darius vs Irelia matchups. I really wanted to breakdown the Camille matchup as well BUT I had already made a video on it so I am linking it here incase you need help with it as well. That video + this means that we've got all the four horsemen matchups covered. Anyway, let me know what you think of the video! It took some time since I have to deal with school right now.<br /><br /><br />If you want coaching from me, join my Discord using this link and send me or my coaches a DM.<br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/QYZqT3b">https://discord.gg/QYZqT3b</a><br /><br /><br />I used the Darius art from my friend Gurvir go check him out!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/GurvirShinda">https://twitter.com/GurvirShinda</a><br /><br /><br />Link To Rhoku's DARIUS MASTER CLASS playlist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJvWvpF-KZGsyC3pAgMdUdM3bZUx8Iac8">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJvWvpF-KZGsyC3pAgMdUdM3bZUx8Iac8</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Updated Darius Guide: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/10-9-strength-is-absolute-rhokus-darius-guide-533056">https://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/10-9-strength-is-absolute-rhokus-darius-guide-533056</a><br /><br />Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/RhokuTV">https://twitter.com/RhokuTV</a><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/rhokuTV">https://www.twitch.tv/rhokuTV</a><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/QYZqT3b">https://discord.gg/QYZqT3b</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/RhokuTV">https://twitter.com/RhokuTV</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/rhokutv/">https://www.instagram.com/rhokutv/</a><br />Facebook Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Rhoku-224450915675449/">https://www.facebook.com/Rhoku-224450915675449/</a>{% endraw %}
