{% raw %}Congregational singing (Bob Kauflin, Shepherds’ Conference)<br />Grace Community Church - Sun Valley, California<br />Tune: MY SAVIOR'S LOVE<br /><br />I stand amazed in the presence<br />Of Jesus the Nazarene,<br />And wonder how He could love me,<br />A sinner condemned, unclean.<br /><br />For me it was in the garden,<br />He prayed: “Not My will, but Thine.”<br />He had no tears for His own griefs,<br />But sweat-drops of blood for mine.<br /><br />How marvelous! How wonderful!<br />And my song shall ever be:<br />How marvelous! How wonderful!<br />Is my Savior’s love for me!<br /><br />In pity angels beheld Him,<br />And came from the world of light<br />To comfort Him in the sorrows<br />He bore for my soul that night.<br /><br />He took my sins and my sorrows,<br />He made them His very own;<br />He bore the burden to Calv’ry,<br />And suffered, and died alone.<br /><br />Refrain<br /><br />When with the ransomed in glory<br />His face I at last shall see,<br />’Twill be my joy through the ages<br />To sing of His love for me.<br /><br />Refrain{% endraw %}
