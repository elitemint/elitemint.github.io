{% raw %}ABOUT THE VIDEO:<br />In this video, Jordan Peterson talks about certain traits a man needs to possess so that they can be deemed desirable. He starts off the video by describing how sexual selection is not a joke. The video has also been edited into three parts. The first part talks about the two traits; Dominance and Good health. Here is a quick recap. Jordan Peterson describes that females tend to choose males who are above the dominance hierarchy. He does better explaining in the video, so go find out more. The second trait he discusses is usefulness. It may sound simplistic but a study he conducted clearly shows that women choose more useful men regardless of their wealth status. Finally, He gives quick advice on how to become a desirable man. I hope you enjoy the video.<br /><br /><br />About Jordan Peterson:<br />Jordan Peterson is a renowned speaker, author, former clinical Psychologist, and Professor. He has written three books so far.

Our Goal is to produce compelling inspirational and educational videos that tackle major areas of life such as relationships, self-help and so much more.<br /><br />How we work:<br />This is a channel that is solely aimed at producing self-development videos with the goal of motivating, inspiring, and educating its viewers. The videos we produce have elements like visuals, audio, and background music Which are not owned by us. But thanks to the fair use policy we are able to use clips e.g. from interviews and Jordan Peterson's lectures and transform them by adding commentary in the form of animation and video footage. Here is how we work. Our editors brainstorm video ideas, then analyze hours of interviews and videos across youtube. After finding the clips, we then stitch them together, add music to provide an immersive experience and commentary in form of video footage and whiteboard animation. This commentary helps transform the video to be unique as well as gives the original clips a new perspective. We also add text animations to emphasize important messages in the video.<br /><br />Community:<br />Follow us on Social Media:<br />Discord:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/js7V6beX">https://discord.gg/js7V6beX</a><br />Instagram:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/wiseadvicem...">https://www.instagram.com/wiseadvicem...</a> ABOUT WISE ADVICE{% endraw %}
