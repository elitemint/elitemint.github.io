{% raw %}This was taken in early January 2020.<br />I'm sorry for my poor English.<br /><br />Women in men's like fashion are justified.<br />I'm the show's guideman Ketsuo!<br /><br />Why don't women who incorporate men's products are more likeable and why don't they look more attractive? Riders jackets and military pants and so on.<br />And vice versa, what is it? Are men who wear ladies' clothing attractive? If you are a female viewer, please let me know in the comments if you are one. I'll refer to it as best I can....<br /><br />Alright, what a setting for this episode, London!<br />Chief Matsushima visits CLUTCH CAFE, a shop in London that embodies the worldview of CLUTCH Magazine.<br /><br />Oyakata begins coordinating the clothes of Lucy, the staff member behind the shop.<br />It's a great way to get in! This is where the strongest theory of two-tack pants was born. Anyway, they're so versatile, you can change your taste and size without losing your balance!<br />Of course, you must be an American girl, and you secretly want your wife or girlfriend to dress like an American girl. You out there must see this too. I highly recommend it to you! Notice the difference in the length of the master's and Lucy's legs?<br /><br />CLUTCHMAN TV starts!<br /><br /><br /><br />Clutch Cafe can also sell them by mail order!
