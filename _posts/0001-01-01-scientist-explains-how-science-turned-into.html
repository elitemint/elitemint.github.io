He explains why scientific literacy has been replaced by combining religion and science. He discusses why the process of science has been distorted to the point of treating science as a religion.

He explains why Nobel prize winners from Richard Feynman to Adam Riess have all questioned the experts who came before them.<br /><br />Want to have a glimpse of some of the research and ideas that are emerging from universities and are about to enter the mainstream and shape our culture?
