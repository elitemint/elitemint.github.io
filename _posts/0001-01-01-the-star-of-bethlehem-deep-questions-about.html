{% raw %}Hello Truth Seekers!  We hope you all had a very Merry Christmas and here's to all the best in 2022!  Tonight, Richard is re-airing a classic episode from Christmastime 2012, hosted by Victor Viggiani.  We're uploading the episode here so you all can hang out &amp; chat along. Thanks for a great year of your support, and here's to more great programs in 2022!<br /><br />STAR OF BETHLEHEM OR UFO?<br /><br />In the first half, guest-host Victor Viggiani examines the lore of the star of Bethlehem which, according to the Bible, guided three wisemen to where a new born child of significant eminence lay in a construct that sheltered animals. Tradition says they came to hail the birth of a new king. Is it possible the star of Bethlehem was actually UFO? <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sites.google.com/site/zlandcommunications/">https://sites.google.com/site/zlandcommunications/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.nigelkerner.com/home.html">http://www.nigelkerner.com/home.html</a><br /><br />Guest: Nigel Kerner was born in Sri Lanka, his mother from a British planting family and his father an officer in the British Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm. This international family base provided the background for an obsessive and serious interest in international human affairs and how these interface with science, religion and philosophy. He has felt driven, from his young years, to expose the humbug and hypocrisy in modern scientific and religious and social thinking. His formal graduate education is in biomedical science and human behavioural psychology. His fascination with the puzzling and enigmatic phenomenon of UFOs resulted in his first book 'The Song of the Greys.' <br /><br />â€‹--<br /><br />A NEW UNDERSTANDING OF CHRISTMAS<br /><br />In hour two, Victor and guest examine a number of provocative questions surrounding Christmas: Who actually were the Magi? Kings or Scientists? What was the celestial phenomenon we are told the Magi followed in the sky? Why was Mary chosen to be the Mother of Jesus? What was the role played by King Herod in the highly politicized world in Judea before and after Christ's birth. Also - how did the Prophecies in the Old Testament foretell the birth of history's most influential man, a man destined to be born in a stable, among lowly farm animals and shepherds? <br /><br /> Guest: Father Robert Geis is a Prelate Protosyncellus in the Eastern Orthodox rite. He has published a number of books on philosophy and theology, as well as Holy Scripture. His work on the Resurrection in the National Catholic Herald is cited as &quot;a remarkable book.&quot; His work on immortality received high marks in the philosophic journal The Review of Metaphysics. He has also written and published one of the most definitive works on Papal authority, Peter and Linus, the question of Papal Infallibility. Many of his works are housed in the US Library of Congress. <br /><br />--<br /><br />Thanks for watching &amp; subscribing to the channel!<br /><br />Please consider supporting us at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patreon.com/strangeplanet">https://patreon.com/strangeplanet</a><br /><br />Or make a one time contribution at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/strangeplanet">https://paypal.me/strangeplanet</a><br /><br />Check out our channel on Rumble to support the fight against big-tech censorship: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rumble.com/c/StrangePlanet">https://rumble.com/c/StrangePlanet</a><br /><br />You can see what's coming next on the show at our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://strangeplanet.ca/">https://strangeplanet.ca/</a><br /><br />And as always, follow the truth: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/richardsyrett">https://twitter.com/richardsyrett</a>{% endraw %}
