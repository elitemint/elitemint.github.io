{% raw %}Hi Guys! Since the last video my husband and I have been extremely busy getting all our formalities sorted. We shall be making an informative video as soon as we move in to our apartment on l the documentations and processing required once you are in Switzerland. Meanwhile I was able to create a video on the most talked about topic in Switzerland grocery shopping! As eating out is incredibly expensive most Swiss and foreign immigrants prefer to cook. Hence, having a basic idea on availability of food and price differences helps you budget and plan ahead of your trip. I decided to shoot a video comparing Aldi and Lidl which are considered low end grocery stores in Switzerland. The two big ones coop and migros will be uploaded on another video. I hope I was able to give you an insight on the expenditure and experience in a Swiss supermarket. <br /><br />Note: Grocery shopping starts at 2:45<br /><br />Do reach out to me for any enquiries: livetotravel110@gmail.com<br /><br />You can follow my instagram for daily updates: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ataleoftravelanddreams110">https://www.instagram.com/ataleoftravelanddreams110</a><br /><br />#switzerland #groceryshopping #vlogger #aldi #lidl #swisslifestyle #europe{% endraw %}
