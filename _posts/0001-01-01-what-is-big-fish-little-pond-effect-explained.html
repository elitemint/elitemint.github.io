Countries all around the world see it with people in all income levels exhibiting such effect.<br />This finding is important as the academic self-concept of a student or their view of themselves as learners are crucial in shaping oneâ€™s self-confidence.<br />It affects their overall school performance, attitudes, and achievements. Not to mention, it has long-lasting effects on their educational outcomes and career aspirations.<br />Of course, Big-Fishâ€“Little-Pond Effect doesnâ€™t just apply to the educational setting, but it also works in different areas.<br />This might be related to your income where you might feel doing well with your finances if you compare yourself with friends who are in deep debt.<br />Of you might consider being in good shape if you only compare yourself with people who donâ€™t exercise at all.<br />But be aware that it could be illusion and you actually have to start working harder to achieve your goals.<br /><br />I hope that you enjoyed this video and I was able to give you a quick summary of what Big-Fishâ€“Little-Pond Effect is and how it affects confidence.<br />_________________<br /><br />Hi, My name is Janis and Iâ€™m Content Creator and Entrepreneur.<br /><br />One thing that Iâ€™m really passionate about is Time Management.
