{% raw %}Diablo III Developer Chris Metzen CONFIRMS Leah is Meant to Return, possibly in Diablo 4?<br /><br />During the latest Diablo lore exploration shorts, <br />I had highlighted the reasoning behind Leah becoming the latest incarnation of the lord of terror<br />Which, like her design, had recieved mixed reviews from the community.<br /><br />However you feel about Leahs ulitmate portrayal in the series, most fans felt a little<br />shortchanged when the prime evil evaporated &amp; unlike Albrecht or the wanderer, her body <br />was not present thereafter. It seems less is more though<br />as it was hinting at a possible return, <br />It's one of the last few plot threads left from the original D3 that weren't answered in Reaper of Souls, <br />but now more likely Diablo 4 in whatever form a fair maiden takes after being lost in the abyss<br /><br />Interestingly, in the behind the scenes of Diablo 3 we learn of Leahs humble beginnings <br />as a side character , her rise as new side kick to Deckard Cain &amp; ultimate fall as the new <br />lord of terror. <br /><br />If you enjoyed this video please consider subscribing: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2D9NKHK">http://bit.ly/2D9NKHK</a><br /><br />Diablo Lore Books: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/gameloredash?listId=18WN7L7VJYA5B">https://www.amazon.com/shop/gameloredash?listId=18WN7L7VJYA5B</a><br />-------‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Let's Connect On Social Media‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è----------<br />üê¶ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/gameloredash">https://twitter.com/gameloredash</a> <br />üì∏ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/gameloredash">https://instagram.com/gameloredash</a><br />üëç Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/gameloredash">https://facebook.com/gameloredash</a><br />üï¥Ô∏èüï¥Ô∏èüï¥Ô∏è Join the fellow Game Lore Junkies on Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/CZQ3BcMe2H">https://discord.gg/CZQ3BcMe2H</a><br />My YouTube Gaming/Recording rig:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/gameloredash">https://www.amazon.com/shop/gameloredash</a><br /><br /><br />Hey, you made it this far!
