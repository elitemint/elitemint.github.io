Tre and Mark both have their own YouTube Channels.<br /><br />I am looking to really build out the GoKaioken community. I do video game live streams, videos with RC cars, Vlogs, and all sorts of other stuff. Willing to make it a full time gig and quit my job (who wouldnâ€™t!) if the growth is there. Feel free to check out the rest of my channel. I try to organize most of my videos into Playlists so you can check out what you are most interested in. :)<br /><br />The Children's Online Privacy Protection ACT is very important. This channel and the videos within this channel are not made for children. The content is not suitable for children due to the language used in the videos. It contains what many would consider to be &quot;adult language&quot; or &quot;adult humor&quot;. Every video uploaded from the date of the enforcement of COPPA compliance will be marked as &quot;not made for kids&quot;. This channel has been set as not made for kids. I never upload content that's made for kids.<br /><br />Additional Hashtags for search!<br />#RC<br />#Gaming<br />#GoPro<br />#Traxxas<br />#Arrma<br />#JoshuaEsposito<br />#GoKaioken<br />#OhioStateFan{% endraw %}
