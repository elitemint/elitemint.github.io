He may see them attempt to break a cash register. At this point it could be a rogue employee that can justify his reason for being there to the owner, but now they interrupted any potential to gather evidence. <br /><br />The town should have keyholder information when a business starts up.

Most business that get broken into have glass broken or doors pried open. <br /><br />@00:00 Start<br />@00:04 Radio Traffic<br />@00:40 First Contact<br />@01:00 first point of argument<br />@04:50 supervisor arrived<br />@06:40 supervisor becomes upset<br />@09:50 another citizen yelled its his store<br />The content contained in the videos are opinions and all persons are innocent until proven guilty.{% endraw %}
