{% raw %}Relatively Speaking by Alan Ayckbourn BBC RADIO DRAMA - Relatively Speaking is a play by British playwright Alan Ayckbourn, originally titled Meet My Father, his first major success. <br /><br />London in the 1960s: Greg wants to marry Ginny, but first she needs to shake off the attention of her older lover (and former boss) Philip and recover some compromising letters. Claiming she is going to meet her parents, she sets off for the country. Love-struck Greg follows and inadvertently arrives first, meeting Philip's wife Sheila, whom he naturally presumes to be Ginny's mother.<br /><br />The scene is set for a comedy of secrets, lies, misunderstandings and farce. <br /><br />For copyright matters, please contact me at biz.thinkingoutloud@gmail.com<br /><br />You can Buy Me A Coffee @ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/thinkingoutloud">https://ko-fi.com/thinkingoutloud</a> <br />Thanks! ðŸ¥°ðŸ’–<br /><br />WHY MY YOUTUBE CHANNEL WAS BANNED - AGAIN!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/rCzeUl3pGXw">https://youtu.be/rCzeUl3pGXw</a><br /><br />Tubebuddy, Your Road to Success <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tubebuddy.com/Thinkingoutloud">https://tubebuddy.com/Thinkingoutloud</a><br /><br />BBC Saturday Night Theatre,BBC Radio Drama,BBC Saturday Night Theatre radio,BBC Radio Drama Saturday Night Theatre,BBC Radio 4 Saturday Night Theatre,Old Time Radio Drama,radio theater,radio theatre,radio drama bbc,radio bbc,radio 4 drama,radio crime drama,radio thriller drama,radio plays bbc<br /><br />BBC Saturday Night Theatre,BBC Radio Drama,BBC Saturday Night Theatre radio,BBC Radio Drama Saturday Night Theatre,BBC Radio 4 Saturday Night Theatre,Old Time Radio Drama,radio theater,radio theatre,radio drama bbc,radio bbc,radio 4 drama,radio crime drama,radio thriller drama,radio plays bbc{% endraw %}
