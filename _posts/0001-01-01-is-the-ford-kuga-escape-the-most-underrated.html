{% raw %}Check out the Ford Kuga Cheat Sheet here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://redriven.com/cheat_sheet/ford-kuga/">https://redriven.com/cheat_sheet/ford-kuga/</a><br /><br />The big used drawcard is bang for your buck, particularly with the older, cheaper and ultimately more value-laden Kugas. The lusty powertrains and dynamically adept platform make for compelling left-field choice outside of the more popular and resale-savvy Toyota and Mazda competitors. And the range-topping Titanium stock make for a whole lot of goodness for not a lot of coin.<br /><br />A well-kept and regularly maintained example of this Kuga/Escape generation makes for a real hidden used car gem.<br /><br />What do you think?

See, you’re the ones that actually buy, live with, love and sometimes unfortunately hate the cars we’ll be reviewing. <br /><br />So we want to hear your thoughts. Hit us up in the comments, or on Instagram and Facebook. <br /><br />We’d love nothing more than for you to give us as much feedback as possible, so we can make this channel the best it can be.<br /><br />Find us on:<br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/redriven_official/">https://www.instagram.com/redriven_official/</a><br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ReDrivenOfficial">https://www.facebook.com/ReDrivenOfficial</a>{% endraw %}
