{% raw %}This is a 45 minute vinyasa flow exploring steadiness (sthira) and ease (sukha) in your practice. It's one of my favourite ways to flow. Each standing sequence is repeated twice. Initially, building integrity &amp; alignment in the postures, moving slow and holding, then we flow with our breath through the same sequence with rhythmic grace and ease. I call it my 'slow, then flow' class. <br /><br />Practice begins with a seated shoulder stretch and twist, followed by some smooth movement to wake up the joints of the spine and hips. Sun Salutation A's and then 2 rounds of standing sequences - chairs, lunges, twists, warriors and triangle.  We warm down with a bridge flow &amp; a twist progressively elongating our exhales to direct ourselves toward rest and shavasana. Enjoy!<br /><br />46 minute practice / 6 minute shavasana<br /><br />Music<br />If you'd like to practice along with music:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6G5ljnAhM9VevOZrOn4pLd?si=Ad6jLWPhQBq2IpNeSKvB1w">https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6G5ljnAhM9VevOZrOn4pLd?si=Ad6jLWPhQBq2IpNeSKvB1w</a><br /><br />Support Two Birds Yoga<br />If you're enjoying the videos and would like to support me creating and posting each week, I'm on Patreon. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=34675514">https://www.patreon.com/user?u=34675514</a><br /><br />Paypal<br />All donations gratefully accepted <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/FIONALANSLEY?locale.x=en_AU">https://paypal.me/FIONALANSLEY?locale.x=en_AU</a>{% endraw %}
