{% raw %}YouTuber's Life 2 continues and we meet up with none other than PewDiePie himself as investigate the somewhat sinister CyberWare trend which is spreading like wildfire. Pewds is very accommodating, giving us a nice picture of himself, helping us with some investigative work and letting himself into our house... actually that is a bit weird.<br /><br />As part of our Scooby-Doo-esque detective work we have to do a live stream from a very important scene and, well, it doesn't really work very well. At all.
