{% raw %}Digging a snowpit in the mountains is just one of many tools that will help give you an information in terms of assessing the snow pack and it’s different layers and their bond between each other . <br />In this episode of How To Xv I go through the basics of choosing where to dig a pit, what to dig, the “tap” test and what you are looking for when you do this. As always practice is the best option so I recommend getting out there and digging a pits regularly to get used to it and getting used to seeing events related to your analysis. <br />But, even better is to go on an avalanche course to learn more about pits and the different snow you might encounter and what that means for you when you go freeriding. <br /><br />Let me know if you have any questions in the comments below. <br />Edit by: Tim Burgess<br />Motion Graphics by: FX Pergola. <br />Thanks to: The North Face, Rossignol &amp; Fatmap{% endraw %}
