BetterHelp is an online counseling company with the mission to make professional counseling accessible, affordable, and convenient.<br /><br />I’m teaching a LIVE workshop later this November to teach you how to make ANY goal stick. <br />Look - the truth is, most people never come close to achieving their goals - and it’s not because they’re not smart enough, or not worthy. It’s because they aren’t using the right strategies to stick to doing the work that’s going to lead to their success. Make no mistake, achieving goals is a PROCESS - that means you can learn it and get better at it. To join me and register your seat, go to live.impacttheory.com.<br /><br />Being able to focus and think critically and strategically seems to become more challenging on  a daily basis. With social media algorithms hacking your attention and focus and everyday life happening at record speeds, you have to become intentional and almost overly protective of your brain. Tom is executing and delivering at an elite level 365 days a year (366 on a leap year) and make no mistake this is by design. Today, he is sharing the 4 main ways he cares for and nurtures his cognitive skills. Taking care of your brain requires that you are aware of all the ways your mental performance is impacted. Tom is sharing exactly what he does on a daily basis as a way of life to keep leveling up and outperforming the competition.<br /> <br />Tom’s Push Pull Split Workout Routine<br />Day 1: Pull - Back &amp; Biceps<br />Day 2: Push - Chest, Shoulders, &amp; Triceps<br />Day 3: Lower Body/Core - Legs &amp; Abs<br /> <br />SHOW NOTES:<br /> <br />0:00 | Introduction Brain Optimization<br />1:40 | Workout to Fuel the Brain<br />5:16 | Reset with Meditation<br />11:26 | Eat to Boost Brain Power<br />23:35 | Sleep to Clear &amp; Reset You Mind<br /> <br />QUOTES:<br /> <br />“Managing your neurochemistry is one of the single most important things you can do.” [5:49]<br /> <br />“Meditation is a magical way that nature has given us where you can reset that to absolute zero to where you feel completely calm and creative and anchored. It is truly a phenomenal gift of evolution” [6:24]<br /> <br />“You miss one night's sleep and there is a catastrophic cascade of biological problems that will present themselves rapidly.” [24:02]<br /> <br />“Being tired is a unique ring of hell, I do not understand people who are prepared to go their entire lives fatigue. It makes everything worse.”{% endraw %}
