{% raw %}The demand for socially responsible investing strategies is growing and the cash flowing into them shows it. Exchange-traded funds with ESG characteristics - ESG of course stands for environmental, social, and governance - have attracted the lion's share of equity money in recent years. <br />In true “follow the money” form, Wall Street has taken notice. There are now many different kinds of socially responsible investment products to choose from. One you don’t hear a lot about is values and faith-based investing, a niche that has been around for decades through separately managed accounts and a few mutual funds. <br /><br />This week’s guest just might change their low profile. He is a widely followed market strategist and successful investor, Robert Doll, Chief Investment Officer and Portfolio Manager at Crossmark Global Investments which he just joined this year.  <br />Doll will fulfill two missions for us. He’ll explain what values and faith-based investing means and update us on his current assessment of the markets and recommended investment strategies.     <br />WEALTHTRACK #1819 broadcast on November 05, 2021<br /><br />00:00 Hello<br />00:59 Introduction<br />02:54 Interview with Bob Doll<br />24:42 One Investment<br />25:15 Action Point<br /><br />More Info &amp; download Boll's commentary: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://wealthtrack.com/values-and-faith-based-investing-with-veteran-strategist-bob-doll/">http://wealthtrack.com/values-and-faith-based-investing-with-veteran-strategist-bob-doll/</a>{% endraw %}
