{% raw %}Allen Simon <br />A basic concept of patterns that where basic paradiddills moved around a drum kits. Also a concept of playing patterns that utilizes right and left hand hi hat and ride syncopation. Always was a fan of trying to be as musical as a guitar or a violin. So when I was a younger musician I would always try to push thing further. Whether it would be very weird timing or common but lot of syncopation or just poly rhythmic patterns. But you always want to be open but also when you should do these patterns{% endraw %}
