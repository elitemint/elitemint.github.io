{% raw %}Presented By:<br />Pandhita Pochanard<br /><br />Speaker Biography:<br />Pandhita Pochanard is the product manager for Genome Editing portfolio at Thermo Fisher Scientific where she is directly responsible for the identification and development of novel genome editing technologies.<br /><br />Webinar:<br />The growing concern of off-target effects: How to measure and minimize off-target effects in your genome editing experiments.<br /><br />Webinar Abstract:<br />CRISPR-Cas9 is a nuclease-based genome editing system which has seen exponential growth in adoption with broad applications from basic research to therapeutics.<br /><br />CRISPR mediated genome editing is an extremely powerful tool capable of achieving high editing efficiencies in wide range of different cell types and gene loci. However, this high editing efficiency comes at a price: off target cleavage. These unintended “off target” edits to the genome can result in undesired phenotypes and slow the progression of your project.<br /><br />In this presentation, we will discuss some common causes of off-target effects during genome editing, as well as explore some strategies that can be taken to help minimize the occurrence of these off-target events during CRISPR editing in iPSCs and T-cells.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Earn PACE Credits:<br />1.
