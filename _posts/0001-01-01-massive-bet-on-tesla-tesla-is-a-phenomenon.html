{% raw %}While the primary reason for the tesla stock's gain on Monday morning may simply be continued momentum from its torrid run last week, two other reports that are circulating could be helping as well.<br /><br />First, the company announced on Monday that it is launching a pilot program under which it will make 10 of its Supercharger stations in the Netherlands usable for non-Tesla vehicles. Non-Tesla vehicles will pay more than Tesla's for a charge, but a membership program that lowers the prices will be available, the company said. If the pilot program goes well, this could lead to a new revenue stream for the automaker.<br /><br />Additionally, the company launched a leasing program in China that lets customers get their hands on Tesla vehicles with no down payment. While the aggressive leasing program could be good for demand, it also signals that the automaker is confident in its ability to ramp up production to meet the demand it already has. Otherwise, why bother initiating such an aggressive new financing option?<br /><br />Tesla entered the fourth quarter with supply constraints. Shipment dates for some of its vehicles are more than four months out. However, new Model 3 orders in the United States are currently slated to ship in December. That supports the argument that Tesla expects it will be able to manage the faster production rates required to meet the rising demand it hopes to generate with its easier leasing option in China.<br /><br />please subscribe to my channel ! <br /><br />#Cathiewood #arkinvest #Tesla <br /><br />Music in the video<br /><br />Vacation by Markvard <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/markvard">https://soundcloud.com/markvard</a><br />Creative Commons â€” Attribution 3.0 Unported  â€” CC BY 3.0 <br />Free Download / Stream: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/al-vacation">https://bit.ly/al-vacation</a><br />Music promoted by Audio Library <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/nxYoIurjLX8">https://youtu.be/nxYoIurjLX8</a><br />â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“<br /><br />ðŸŽµ Track Info:<br /><br />Title: Vacation by Markvard<br />Genre and Mood: Dance &amp; Electronic + Happy<br /><br />Sources<br />Jim Cramer: Electric car shares and why Tesla is a 'phenomenon'<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvomhvEgCsw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvomhvEgCsw</a><br /><br />Is It Too Late to Buy Tesla Stock?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/11/02/is-it-too-late-to-buy-tesla-stock/">https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/11/02/is-it-too-late-to-buy-tesla-stock/</a>{% endraw %}
