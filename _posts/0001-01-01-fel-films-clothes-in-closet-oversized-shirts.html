{% raw %}hi, we all know that oversized shirts are still used these days. that’s why i decided to share to all of u guys how i style my oversized shirts so i can repeat all of ‘em after awhile. so, there you would see how i pair up my dark and light colored oversized shirts with some pieces in my closet. you’d all notice that i only use one palette for each oversized shirt since i think that it would best compliment both outfits. so, i hope u guys would take this as a styling tip when choosing pieces to pair your clothes up with. make sure to consider choosing first the palette/color scheme before you actually make up your mind. thanks a lot u guys!! <br /><br />just a quick tmi. this took me so much time to edit and i still did finish it despite of having a mountain of schoolbook assessments. but, it doesn’t stress me out so much since i can manage to finish some of ‘em within a day. so i hope y’all wouldn’t be bothered about me posting loads of content almost everyday when we got so much assessments to do. i bet some of y’all are wondering why i got so much time to do these extra activities (youtube + instagram posts) and i’m responding to all of your thoughts now. u guys i am doing all of my sb assesments and pts with the best quality i could give, i swear! hehe (y’all know me, especially my closest ones, i’m extra.)<br /><br />anyways, i hope you all like it since i really invested so much time and effort to share my styling tips in a creative way. i really did make it like those dress up games on online sites. thank you n i hope you all appreciate it! pls do like and subscribe, for me to still go on for more videos soon! thanks a bunch mwa<br /><br /><br /><br />follow me on these:<br />instagram: @felfilms / art business @artificefelicity<br />facebook: Julia Felicity<br />twitter: @juliafelicity<br /><br /><br />Music:<br />Plastic w/ SUBI - Cashua Owen<br />No Diamonds and Pearls - Calvin Keith<br />In Love - khai dreams<br /><br /><br />NO COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT INTENDED<br /><br /><br />#fashion #fashiontrend #fashionstyle #fashionph #outfit #outfitinspo #outfitstyle #lookbook #trendyclothes #philippines{% endraw %}
