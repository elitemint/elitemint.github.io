{% raw %}Let’s face it, we end up in places that we simply aren’t allowed to carry a knife or gun, but would still like to have something that can work as an equalizer in an emergency situation. The “Stabby” may be one of your best options. At $30-$40, it’s a cheap sense of security. <br /><br />Don’t be a dummy, don’t try to carry these into a place where they’re against the law (courthouse, airplane, etc), your ass will end up in jail. <br /><br />Get yours at TheNecroMaker.com and follow him on Instagram at: @The.Necro.Maker<br /><br />Help support the channel and win awesome EDC items: Patreon.com/JimSkeltonKnives{% endraw %}
