{% raw %}Are You Smarter Than A Fifth Grader is one of the most successful game shows of all time, so I thought I’d take a swing at the questions to see if my years of medical school and higher education would give me an edge. Honestly, some of these questions were extremely difficult. I answered questions about teeth, the planets, Connecticut, prime numbers, US Presidents, lungs, the 20th century, Red Square, Dwight D. Eisenhower, color theory, roman numerals, how to read a clock, calcium in your bones, grammar, flags, 100 yards, hartford, Mars, blood cells, stapes, The Statue of Liberty, Tamarins, REM cycles, the periodic table, Acadia National Park, and tooth enamel with my friend Dr. Daniel Rubenshtein. We may not have Jeff Foxworthy, but this quiz is brutal. How did you do?<br /><br />I LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously.
