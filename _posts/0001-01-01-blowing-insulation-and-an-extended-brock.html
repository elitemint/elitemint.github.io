{% raw %}Border View Farms is a mid sized family farm that sits on the Ohio-Michigan border. We raise corn, soybeans, and wheat on a little over 3,000 acres. <br /><br />My name is Nathan. I run this channel and farm with my dad, Mark and uncle, Phil.  I started making these videos in the fall of 2019 as a way to help show what I do on a daily basis as a farmer. I get questions about how and why we do things on the farm frequently, even from my own family members, so to help explain things it's easier to just show you.  I hope that I can address questions or concerns that you might have about farms and agriculture in general as well as dispel some of the common misconceptions. <br /><br />I hope you enjoy my content and please ask questions as you have them. I do my best to answer anything I can. <br /><br />I appreciate you subscribing to my channel and liking my videos.<br /><br />You can reach me through messages on Facebook or Instagram @borderviewfarms or by email bakernth@gmail.com.  Please don't call my parents house!{% endraw %}
