I built some cabinets out of oak veneered plywood that included two banks of drawers as well as plenty of hanging space. This build was a fun challenge to maximize the useful space in such a compact area. And I don’t build a lot of cabinets, so it was a fun change of pace to the usual furniture builds we have around here.<br /><br />MUSIC<br />Sleepy Pablo - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sleepypablo.bandcamp.com/">https://sleepypablo.bandcamp.com/</a>{% endraw %}
