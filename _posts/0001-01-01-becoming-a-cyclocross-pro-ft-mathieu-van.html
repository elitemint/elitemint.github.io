{% raw %}I don't have to explain to you who Mathieu van der Poel is, but i will anyways: he's a multiple cyclocross world champion, multiple tour de france etape winner, european mountainbike champion, etc... This guy knows how to ride a bike. And if that wasn't enough, he's also a nice guy who wants to teach 2 short badly in shape brothers with terrible form how to ride cyclocross. In this video we visit the world of cyclocross: a mix of moutainbiking and road cycling. Basically you ride with a road bike in the mud and sometimes you have to jump off and run because the course is unridable haha. Does it make sense? No. Is it amazing to watch. Absolutely! Enjoy the video. PS: Also thanks to Canyon for borrowing the bikes. Hope we didn't break them!<br /><br />SHOW SOME LOVE TO THE LEGEND MATHIEU<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/mathieuvanderpoel">http://instagram.com/mathieuvanderpoel</a><br /><br />GET SOME MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://averagerob.com">https://averagerob.com</a><br /><br />instagram rob: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/averagerob">http://instagram.com/averagerob</a><br />instagram arno: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/arnothekid">http://instagram.com/arnothekid</a><br />filmed &amp; edited by milan: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/milancools">https://www.instagram.com/milancools</a>{% endraw %}
