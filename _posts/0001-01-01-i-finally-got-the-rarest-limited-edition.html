What a moment. <br /><br />For context, this Ben White Limited Edition (much like the Gylfi Sigurdsson Limited Edition) is only available inside LUCKY packs. Unlike the other Limited Editions in this set, you can't get this guaranteed in a set product, hence why it is so so rare and recent listings on eBay have seen this sell for above £70...<br /><br />A massive thank you to William and Suzanne for sorting out the swap for this Ben White card, I really do appreciate it! I have been waiting so long to get it for either a good price or a good swap and I am so glad you came along and offered it to me! Thank you!<br /><br />You can order some Adrenalyn XL packs at Panini's online website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.panini.co.uk/catalogsearch/result/?q=004168">https://www.panini.co.uk/catalogsearch/result/?q=004168</a><br />======================================================<br />Thank you for watching my video!
