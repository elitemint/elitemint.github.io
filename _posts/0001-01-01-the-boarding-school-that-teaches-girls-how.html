Today we are talking about a very sinister boarding school! <br /><br />The girls don't know what came before their lives at the Academy. For as long as they remember they had been raised in this underground school. <br />Their names, clothes, and identity we're all given to them by the Academy. All they knew was that at the end of their schooling they would be adopted by a high society family.<br />That was purpose of the school - but why was that girls started disappearing in the middle of the night? None of the girls had even been allowed outside... Who was running the school? And for what?<br /><br /><br />#StephanieSoo<br />#BakingAMystery<br />#Mystery<br />#Storytime{% endraw %}
