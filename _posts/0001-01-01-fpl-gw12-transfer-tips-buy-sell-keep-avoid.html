In this series I will identify the best and worst transfer moves for the gameweek to help you make the best decisions.<br /><br />These tips are built on the premise that there will be players you already have and you need to know whether to keep or sell, and players you don't have that you need to know whether to buy or avoid. Using this formula we will help you get ahead of bandwagons, avoid bad bandwagons, and built continually improve your Fantasy Premier League team throughout the season.<br /><br />If you like what you see, subscribe and become my latest mate!<br /><br />🐦 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/FPLMate">https://www.twitter.com/FPLMate</a><br />📸 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/FPLMate">https://www.instagram.com/FPLMate</a><br />👾 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/rfVSeftbmx">https://discord.gg/rfVSeftbmx</a><br />🏆 Join: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCweDAlFm2LnVcOqaFU4_AGA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCweDAlFm2LnVcOqaFU4_AGA/join</a><br />️⚽️ FPL Mate league link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fantasy.premierleague.com/leagues/auto-join/b8usac">https://fantasy.premierleague.com/leagues/auto-join/b8usac</a><br />️⚽️ FPL Mate league code: b8usac<br />👕 FPL Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fplmate.myspreadshop.co.uk/">https://fplmate.myspreadshop.co.uk/</a><br /><br />#FPL #FantasyPremierLeague #PremierLeague{% endraw %}
