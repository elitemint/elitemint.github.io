{% raw %}10 hours of wonderful Azan in the world<br /><br />10 ساعات من الأذات المكرر بصوت لا يمل منه سامعه<br /><br />The Adhan, also written as Adhaan, Azan, Azaan or Athan.<br /><br />The very first words the  مؤذنmoazzin (one who makes the call to prayers) utters are:<br />اللہ اکبر (Allaho Akbar) Allah is the greatest. The opening word is اللہ (God). It attracts the attention of the listeners. Allah is the creator, the maker and the giver of all that man can think of, nay, even much more than his imagination. The mention of the attribute of Greatness draws further attention and attaches greater importance to it. This phrase is repeated four times thereby asserting the opening pronouncement.<br /><br />The Muazzin then proceeds to say:<br />أشهد أن لا اله إلا الله<br />I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship save Allah;<br /><br />أشهد أن محمد رسول الله<br />I bear witness that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.<br /><br />حي على الصلاة<br />حي على الفلاح<br />‘‘O ye people, hurry up to join the prayers, hurry up because this is the complete prosperity.”<br /><br />الله أكبر الله أكبر لا إله إلا الله<br />“Allah is the greatest and I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship save Allah.”<br /><br />------------------<br />صفحتنا على الفيسبوك<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cutt.us/cBfiD">https://cutt.us/cBfiD</a>{% endraw %}
