Mike will share those books with you… but as he says, he ended up doing so much research that two-thirds of what he’d written about the Great Depression had to be cut!<br />Sit back and enjoy Mike reading some excerpts of what was cut from his book, along with some photos and other quotes from that painful era. Listen to how they sound oh-so-familiar to what is happening today.<br />The future may be unknown, but the more you study history the more you can be prepared for whatever may come. Tune in to watch Mike talk about the lessons he learned from studying one of the most painful economic periods in US history.<br />Thanks for sharing and clicking that 'Like' button.
