My online class is structured with checklists and printouts where you can track your child's progress. <br /><br />So zooming out, my YouTube videos teach the “what” and my online class teaches the “how.” The goal of the online class is to give you the skills needed to plug in the speech strategies into your daily life with your child and to implement the building blocks, strategies, and concepts during meal time, car riding time, play time, outdoor time, etc. <br /><br />Here is more info about the class so you can see if it would be a good fit for what you are looking for with your child. <br /><br />The Steps to Help Your Child Learn To Talk: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.learnwithadrienne.com/steps-to-help-your-child-learn-to-talk">https://www.learnwithadrienne.com/steps-to-help-your-child-learn-to-talk</a><br /><br />P.S. For safety, always fully supervise your child when doing activities that I recommend in my videos.<br /><br />WHAT DO I USE TO FILM?<br />📷 Camera*: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2BhKJGK">https://amzn.to/2BhKJGK</a><br />🎙️ Microphone*: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2vVerMP">https://amzn.to/2vVerMP</a><br />💡 Studio Lighting*: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2KYVn4W">https://amzn.to/2KYVn4W</a><br /><br />The links with asterisks* above are affiliate links, which means that if you click on one of the product links and purchase something, I’ll receive a small commission at no additional cost to you.
