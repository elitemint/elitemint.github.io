{% raw %}Besides the &quot;precise gunplay,&quot; what helps Valorant stand out from its competitors -- like CSGO -- are the unique agents players are able to utilize.<br /><br />Valorant has been out for over a year now. And some days, it feels like all Riot hears from their player-base is: “Fix The Agents!” <br /><br />But are there really any agents that are too good? Or, is it the players who play them that make the agents “broken?”<br /><br />Let's find out. <br /><br />Written &amp; Hosted by: Elisabeth Marchini (@ejmarchini)<br />Edited by: Sam Gore (@famgore)<br />Thumbnail by: Brandon Mistele<br />Produced by: Keith Capstick (@KeithCapstick) &amp; Danny Burke (@lurkeyburke)<br /><br />All footage courtesy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pastebin.com/7FXVxgLn">https://pastebin.com/7FXVxgLn</a><br /><br />Music used under license from Associated Production Music LLC (”APM”).<br /><br />Follow us on Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitch.tv/thescoreesports">http://www.twitch.tv/thescoreesports</a><br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/thescoreesports">http://twitter.com/thescoreesports</a><br />Follow us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/theScoreesports">https://www.facebook.com/theScoreesports</a><br />Follow us on TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.tiktok.com/@thescoreesports">http://www.tiktok.com/@thescoreesports</a><br />Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/theScoreesports">https://instagram.com/theScoreesports</a>{% endraw %}
