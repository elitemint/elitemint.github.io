{% raw %}My advice for how to learn a language in 2021 based off the path I took to obtain fluency in Spanish last year after a year of language learning. Aside from finally becoming fluent in a 2nd language after trying and failing for many years, I also learned a few great pieces of advice along the way from fellow YouTubers and language learners that made a significant impact on my ability to learn the language and enjoy the process. In this video I give away all the secrets!<br /><br /><br />Welcome to What's Good English! On this channel we explore the slang, common phrases, idioms, and AAVE. My goal is to help English learners learn the meanings behind some of our harder to understand vocabular and phrases that are in our common speech in context. I do this through telling stories with slang, idioms, and odd phrases sprinkled in every Tuesday as well as explaining certain aspects of the language more in depth every Friday. I try demonstrate as much as I can acted out in humorous (ok well sometimes humorous) sketches so they can be learned with real context because that helps us remember far better than a simple explanation. I'm a language learner myself and occasionally I upload a bonus episode about language learning tips and things I learned through my trials and errors trying to learn languages. If you like what you've read, please subscribe and share my videos around. My goal really is to help as many people as I can understand these fun curiosities of the English Language.<br /><br />Thank you so very much for watching!<br /><br />E.K.
