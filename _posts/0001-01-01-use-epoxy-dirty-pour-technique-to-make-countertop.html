Mix your pre-measured primer then dip and roll the pigmented primer across the surface until the countertop surface is completely covered. Wait 1 hr. (or until tacky and not coming off to the touch) and start applying the Base Coat.<br /><br />METALLIC EPOXY COAT<br />There are so many different applications for our metallic epoxy coat. In this video, we show you the dirty pour technique. When you place your order you'll receive step by step tutorial videos that will show you how to apply this part depending on the look you're going for! <br /><br />HIGH WEAR TOP COAT<br />We offer 2 different Performance Engineered Top Coats. Glaze Coat is our High Build Top Coat that lays out like glass and adds depth to the Countertop. The Urethane Top Coat comes with the option to have a High Gloss or Matte finish. It needs to be rolled out super thin and leaves a minor texture on the countertop. You apply it within 24 hrs. of installing your Countertop Kit<br />How To Apply WB Urethane Top Coat: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RD5jmrgHvU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RD5jmrgHvU</a><br /><br /><br />Leggari Countertop Kits were designed to transform your countertop, tabletop, or desktop into something new and beautiful by coating your existing countertop or pre-built wood countertop.
