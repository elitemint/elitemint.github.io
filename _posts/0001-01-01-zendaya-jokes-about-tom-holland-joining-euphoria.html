{% raw %}‘Euphoria’ is back for Season 2, and ‘Extra’s’ Rachel Lindsay interviewed Zendaya, Hunter Schafer and Dominic Fike about what to expect. Zendaya jokes about BF Tom Holland – who has expressed a desire to make a cameo on the show – joining the series in an unexpected way. (No luck just yet!) She also opens up about where we find Rue in her struggles with addiction. Plus, Hunter teases where Rue and Jules stand, and Dominic talks about making his acting debut.‘Euphoria’ Season 2 premieres January 9 on HBO.{% endraw %}
