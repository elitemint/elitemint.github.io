{% raw %}China has weaponised airplanes and Cargo Ships! The world would soon ban Chinese ships and airplanes.<br />China is a menace. It is that disease which you want to get rid of, but whose extermination will be painful for you too. But China is now crossing a limit. Its madness knows no bounds. China is constantly blurring the lines between its military establishment and infrastructure, and the world. It is deploying its assets and weapons around the world. People, companies, and legit weapon systems – China is transporting these around the world to get its objectives fulfilled. Countries are now waking up to the threat posed by anything even remotely Chinese. And the threat is large. To make matters worse, it is most often concealed.<br />Soon, Chinese airlines and shipping vessels might face a global ban. Their movement might be restricted. Countries are realising that anything Chinese must simply not be touched, no matter how long the pole is. While Chinese airlines have been found to be spying, the communist nation’s commercial shipping vessels are actually warships that can launch missile attacks.<br />Chinese airlines spying for the CCP:<br />China has groomed its companies to spy on behalf of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) regime. Xi Jinping uses state-owned Chinese companies as malware. He uses them as tools of espionage. So far, he was using companies to debt trap and collect information about countries around the world. It has now been revealed that the CCP is using airline corporations and major Chinese air travel companies to spy on strategic assets, like airports around the world, especially in the United States of America.<br /><br />According to the United States’ Department of Homeland Security (DHS), during inspections at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), DHS personnel “observed instances of possible assistance with foreign intelligence collection being conducted by Air China airline employees.” According to Yahoo News, the intelligence report describes a series of incidents at LAX that aroused suspicions with DHS personnel, including what appeared to be Air China employees using their phones to surreptitiously record interviews by Customs and Border Protection officials of Chinese citizens who had performed scientific research at US universities and were now leaving the country.{% endraw %}
