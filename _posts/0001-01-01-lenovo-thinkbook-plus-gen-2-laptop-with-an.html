{% raw %}The Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 2 would seem like a completely mainstream 13.3” QHD+ aluminum clad slim and light premium Ultrabook, but Lenovo added a little something special: a second 12” QHD+ e-ink display on the laptop’s lid. Both displays have a 16:10 aspect ratio with 2560 x 1600 resolution and support pen and touch (you can only 1 display at a time). You can use the power-sipping e-ink display in a tablet-like fashion, or open up the laptop and use it as a normal notebook PC. Inside we have Intel quad core CPUs, 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD. Pricing starts around $1,255.{% endraw %}
