{% raw %}The European Union is preparing to deploy a surveillance plane over the English Channel to monitor crossings by migrants. The announcement follows a meeting between France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany in the French port of Calais.<br />This comes after 27 people died when their inflatable boat sank.
