{% raw %}An awesome sculpture to celebrate the hopefully soon to be released Avatar Live-Action Netflix Adaptation! Here's hoping they don't mess it up like The Last Airbender movie! This is a really cool sculpture by Mag-Net over on Cults3D. This whole print turned out a little wonky but it looks good enough from a from view angle that I didn't mind! Here are some details about the print! Watch the video for a more in-depth description!<br /><br />Printer: Creality LD-002R SLA Printer<br />Resin Brand: Elegoo<br />Resin Colors: ABS-Like Cool Blue, Black, and Translucent<br /><br />(The base and little Aang's resin was created by mixing SLA resins, more specifically doing a 70/30 mix of Elegoo Translucent Resin and Elegoo Black Resin.)<br /><br />Model(s) printed in this video:<br /><br />Avatar: The Last Airbender by Mag-Net<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/art/avatar-the-last-airbender">https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/art/avatar-the-last-airbender</a><br /><br />Music used in this video:<br /><br />Background Music: The Pyre by Incompetech<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/?keywords=pyre">https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/?keywords=pyre</a><br /><br />#AvatarNetflix #3DPrinted #TheLastAirbender{% endraw %}
