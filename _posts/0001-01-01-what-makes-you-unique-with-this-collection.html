{% raw %}With this collection, we celebrate the uniqueness of each child.<br /><br />​We want children to be proud of what makes them different, to embrace it, to find their strength in what makes them unique. We are honouring the odd fish, the strange birds, the introverts and the extroverts. <br />This season, we made sure that nothing was quite ‘how it should be’. Our prints are hand drawn and there is always something that ‘shouldn’t be there’. Every piece that is available in our Black Odd Ball, Navy Odd Ball or Black Slinky Stripe prints features a shape or colour in a position that is exclusive to that piece. No Bean in these prints will be the same making each piece special. We hope your children have as much fun wearing these playful and comfy designs as we did making them!<br /><br />We also want to GIVEAWAY a $100 Gift Card.
