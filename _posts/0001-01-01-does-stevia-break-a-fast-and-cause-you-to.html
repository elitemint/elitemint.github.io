{% raw %}Does STEVIA break an Intermittent Fast and cause you to gain weight? Technically, stevia will not break a fast... BUT there are some people that might not benefit from using stevia. The sweet taste of stevia can trigger increased sugar cravings in some people and make it harder to say no to a sweet treat later in the day. Some people have noticed a weight loss plateau with stevia while Intermittent Fasting as well. The only way to tell if you're sensitive to stevia is to test out removing it and see what happens!<br /><br />#shorts{% endraw %}
