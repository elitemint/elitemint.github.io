{% raw %}Hot-dip galvanizing process is the immersion of iron or steel articles in molten zinc to apply a protective coating. All material processed is in accordance with EN ISO 1461: 2009.<br /><br />When the clean iron or steel component is dipped into the molten zinc (at 450Â°C) a series of zinc-iron alloy layers are formed by a metallurgical reaction between the iron and zinc. Upon withdrawal from the galvanizing bath a layer of molten zinc will be taken out on top of the alloy layer. This cools to exhibit the bright shiny appearance associated with galvanized products.<br /><br />Visit www.galco.ie for more information{% endraw %}
