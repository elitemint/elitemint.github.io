{% raw %}We found the Word, we found a church, and we found reforms, but we hadn't found GOD. If you can't live with your Queen at home, and your children at home, you are putting on a Face at church. You are PLAYING Church. God doesn't want you to play church. He wants you to find HIM. He wants to Empower You. He wants to Empower your Marriage and Family. You see to Abide in Christ is to surrender all your known choices to Christ in the moment.{% endraw %}
