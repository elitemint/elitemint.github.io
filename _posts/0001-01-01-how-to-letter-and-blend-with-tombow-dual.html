{% raw %}Have Courage &amp; Be Kind. ðŸ¦‹<br /><br />This lettering piece from my Instagram was inspired by Cinderella.<br /><br />In this video, I showed you how to do Faux Calligraphy, how to create lettering and blend with Tombow Dual Brush Pens, and how to add shadow. My blending tip is to do it while it's still wet. That's why I always add the base color before applying the blending color. <br /><br />I hope you enjoy this video.
