Grotesque, grimly funny, utterly absurd, yet genuinely nightmarish and really rather horrible, this is one you won't forget any time soon. And you will never look at a stuffed toy penguin in the same way again.<br /><br />&quot;Peter the Penguin&quot; Credits:<br />Written &amp; Directed by Andrew Rutter<br />Produced by Joanna Caldwell &amp; Ashley Gardiner<br />Director of Photography | Christopher Hood<br />Sound Design by Simon Peecock<br />Executive Producer | Chris Butler<br />Creature Design by Tom Ellis<br />Boom Operator | Jamie Stainton<br /><br />Starring Chris Butler, Alex Kapila, Mia Hemerling, Peter Terry &amp; Joe Capella.<br /><br />About ALTER:<br />ALTER is an ever-expanding platform for the most daring storytellers in the world of horror.
