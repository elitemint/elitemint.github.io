{% raw %}I got a call from someone saying that there is a puppy in a waterway alone, he said he saw a dead dog body by the road, his mother may have died, I finished my work and i went there, what the person said is accurate, the mother was hit by a car or a truck, I didn't want to film her{% endraw %}
