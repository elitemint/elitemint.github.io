{% raw %}What is the meaning of suffering? One of the problems of life is suffering without meaning. Life is pervaded by suffering, and this suffering must be meaningful. It is hard to deny that to live is to suffer, as long as we do not mean that to live is only to suffer. <br /><br />One who cannot bear suffering and tries to avoid the unavoidable is bound to end up in existential despair and nihilism, death is just as welcome as there’s no purpose for living.<br /><br />This video explores how to tackle the problem of suffering (&quot;why do I suffer?&quot;), with the objective of finding a meaning to one's suffering. There are two ideals: to see suffering as a punishment (ascetic ideal) or to seeing it as something for human growth, flourishing and greatness.<br /><br />⭐ Support this channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/eternalised">https://www.patreon.com/eternalised</a><br />📺 YouTube Member Perks: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join</a><br />☕ Donate a Coffee: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/eternalised">https://ko-fi.com/eternalised</a><br />🛒 Official Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://eternalised.creator-spring.com">https://eternalised.creator-spring.com</a><br />🎨 Access transcript and artwork gallery <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://eternalisedofficial.com/2021/09/03/the-meaning-of-suffering">https://eternalisedofficial.com/2021/09/03/the-meaning-of-suffering</a><br /><br />━━━━━━━━━━━━━<br /><br />📚 Recommended Reading <br /><br />▶ Man’s Search for Meaning - Viktor Frankl<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/34aiBkx">https://amzn.to/34aiBkx</a><br />▶ Beyond Good and Evil - Friedrich Nietzsche<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2DDjLLL">https://amzn.to/2DDjLLL</a><br />▶ On the Genealogy of Morals - Friedrich Nietzsche<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3jj0izq">https://amzn.to/3jj0izq</a><br />▶ Notes from the Underground - Fyodor Dostoevsky<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2DBRXas">https://amzn.to/2DBRXas</a><br />▶ Man and His Symbols - Carl Jung<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3lYyz94">https://amzn.to/3lYyz94</a><br />▶ The Myth of Sisyphus - Albert Camus<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3jQxA9n">https://amzn.to/3jQxA9n</a><br /><br />🎧 Prefer Audiobooks?
