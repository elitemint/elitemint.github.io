{% raw %}Sara Pascoe  once lost her hair when a hairdresser left bleach on for 8 HOURS.<br />The comedian made the revelation on  Jason Manford 's Comedy Central panel show, The Complaints Department. <br />Even after the horrendous experience, which led to her scalp burning, she still paid hundreds of pounds for the service because she finds it so hard to complain.<br />The Complaints Department airs tonight (Monday Septembetr 27, 2021) at 9pm.{% endraw %}
