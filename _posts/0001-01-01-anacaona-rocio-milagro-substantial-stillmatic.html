{% raw %}The new single, 'Stillmatic' OUT NOW<br />Download/Stream: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://smarturl.it/stillmatic">http://smarturl.it/stillmatic</a><br /><br />:: CREDITS ::<br />Writers: R. Pena, S. Robinson, E. Sellers<br />Producer: Substantial<br />Cover art: Kenny Rivero<br /><br />:: SONG/POEM DESCRIPTION ::<br />Stillmatic is the 2nd piece of a three-part ‘poetic-triptych’ written by poet Anacaona Rocio Milagro, produced by Substantial, with Lizzie Blue on the piano, and cover art by Kenny Rivero. Titled after and honoring the 20 year anniversary of Nas’s album Stillmatic, the poet speaks of her favorite day: when her big brother, all the way from Washington Heights, deep in street life, stepped out and somehow found her in the Bronx during her undisclosed religious initiation ceremony just so they could listen to the entire Nas album together in his car the day it dropped—this is how he loves. They &quot;Nodded their heads until their thorn crowns spun off… into glowing disks.&quot; The ‘poetic-triptych’s’ first piece is titled When You Were Red and describes losing a brother to street life, to then find him again in this piece Stillmatic, only to lose him again in the final piece titled Delirium (coming soon). Twenty years later, and it’s still the poet's favorite day.<br /><br />:: ABOUT ANACAONA ROCIO MILAGRO ::<br />Anacaona Rocio Milagro is a poet born and raised in New York City, Washington Heights.

It dropped today.<br />He needed to be the |one| to deliver it to me, needed to bear<br />witness, to be church for my monosyllabic prayer: Nas<br /><br />This is how he loves, my legendary brother Elegua.<br /><br />His search for |me| rippled the gray out the block, out the clouds<br />out the clock. His ultraviolet light resurrected my childhood<br />suicides that I’d done to subside. Giddy little dead girls ascended<br />out the dungeons of my mouth and joined us<br /><br />I rolled his blunt. He never let me smoke: For your own good.<br />He’d turn the speakers up/ paused/ rewind lines / we zoned out.<br />Listened through sunset and nightfall to ethereal prophecy.<br />Nodded our heads until our thorn-crowns spun off<br />into glowing disks<br /><br />I didn't know it then that this day would be my favorite<br />a holy day all was forgiven<br /><br />with the smell of dead pigeons still fresh on my fingers<br /><br />Ashe<br /><br />-------<br />Follow Anacaona Rocio Milagro: <br />BANDCAMP: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://anacaonarociomilagro.bandcamp.com/">https://anacaonarociomilagro.bandcamp.com/</a><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/poet.anacaona/">https://www.instagram.com/poet.anacaona/</a><br />SPOTIFY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3m2RRKTNfkxXOtMfOUkmVP?si=C-OIH4KKSqm-tEkPfUZuCQ">https://open.spotify.com/artist/3m2RRKTNfkxXOtMfOUkmVP?si=C-OIH4KKSqm-tEkPfUZuCQ</a><br /><br />Follow Lizzie Blue:<br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lizzieebluee/">https://www.instagram.com/lizzieebluee/</a><br />SPOTIFY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4X5kopqfbKmppdxIlU1ycy?si=Mbr0xHFcSKaFttoijpsiGg">https://open.spotify.com/artist/4X5kopqfbKmppdxIlU1ycy?si=Mbr0xHFcSKaFttoijpsiGg</a><br /><br />Follow Substantial<br />WEBSITE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://iamsubstantial.com">http://iamsubstantial.com</a><br />BANDCAMP: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://substantial.bandcamp.com/">https://substantial.bandcamp.com/</a><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/substantialmusic">https://www.instagram.com/substantialmusic</a><br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/SubstantialMusic">https://www.facebook.com/SubstantialMusic</a><br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/IamSubstantial">https://twitter.com/IamSubstantial</a><br />SPOTIFY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/substantialmusic">https://bit.ly/substantialmusic</a><br />TWITCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/substantialmusic">https://www.twitch.tv/substantialmusic</a><br /><br />#anacaonarociomilagro #substantial #lizzieblue #stillmatic{% endraw %}
