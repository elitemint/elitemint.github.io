{% raw %}This is the title of the video  “If this sign appears then understand that someone loves you very much | Islamic Teacher “ <br /><br />This video summarizes something like this.<br />In the video, it is said that sometimes a person gets a success which he does not expect. And about which man has no illusions ... That he will get this success or happiness ... And he gets that success ... And this man is lost in this happiness ...<br />But it does not try to know that ... Why did I get this success or happiness? What could be the reason behind this?<br />... Hazrat Ali (RA) says about this ... That whenever you start feeling very happy and the feelings of happiness start growing inside you ... Know that someone is praying for you somewhere ...<br />That is why it is said that the lucky person is ... Who gets the loyalty of a friend and the prayers of a mother ...<br />For one thing, we know that ... This is also a sign of love. That those who love you pray for you ... And the second lesson I got from today's video ... That is ... That those who want ... May their prayers be accepted soon ... So they should pray for others ... Inshallah their prayers will start to be accepted ... And they will also join these lucky people ... For which the angels pray ...<br />You can imagine this in your own life ... How many people love you ... And how many times has this happened in your life ... That you have come out of some difficulty as a result of someone's prayers.<br /><br />Like Us On  Youtube Channel ↪►► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/IslamicTeacher786">https://www.youtube.com/c/IslamicTeacher786</a><br />Like Us On Facebook... ↪►► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Islamicteacher00661">https://www.facebook.com/Islamicteacher00661</a><br />Follow Us On Google + ... ↪►► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+IslamicTeacher786">https://plus.google.com/+IslamicTeacher786</a><br />Follow Us On Twitter... ↪►► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/TCn0FX">https://goo.gl/TCn0FX</a><br />Follow Us On Instagram... ↪►► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/IslamicTeacher9900/">https://www.instagram.com/IslamicTeacher9900/</a> <br />Follow Us On Facebook Id.... ↪►► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/I143pakistan">https://www.facebook.com/I143pakistan</a><br /><br /><br />*Disclaimer<br />-------------------<br />The content on this video is designed for educational and informational purposes only.Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
