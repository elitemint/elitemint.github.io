{% raw %}I’ve reported that Facebook censored me. Now I’ve learned that Facebook also censors respected science writers John Tierney, Michael Shellenberger and Bjorn Lomborg.<br />-------- <br />Don't miss a single video from Stossel TV. Sign up here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.johnstossel.com/#subscribe">https://www.johnstossel.com/#subscribe</a><br />--------<br />Facebook, and its so-called &quot;fact-checker,&quot; Science Feedback, censored former NYT reporter John Tierney for daring to say that masking kids can do harm. <br /><br />They censored environmentalist Michael Shellenberger, who Time Magazine listed among “heroes of the environment,” after he dared to say that climate change is not an apocalypse, and that we're not in a &quot;mass extinction.&quot; <br /><br />They censored statistician and environmentalist Bjorn Lomborg for pointing out that data show that temperature-related deaths FELL as the world warms.<br /><br />Who did Facebook work with to censor these good points? A group of left-wingers called the Poynter Institute. <br /><br />Why would they censor important facts? I go into that in the video above.{% endraw %}
