{% raw %}Having trouble falling asleep — or staying asleep? Alcohol, sleeping pills or drugs like marijuana help you in the short-term, but they’re only a quick fix, says sleep scientist Matt Walker. There is, however, one proven way to treat your insomnia and help you get the zzz’s you need.<br /><br />Sleep -- we spend one-third of our lives doing it, but what exactly do we get out of it?
