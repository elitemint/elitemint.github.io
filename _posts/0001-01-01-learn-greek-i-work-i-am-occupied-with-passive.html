{% raw %}In this Recorded Live Facebook Session I help you come to grips with the passive voice verbs εργάζομαι (I am working) and ασχολούμαι (I am occupied/busy with). I explain how to use these in phrases while interacting with the FB live session participants. I am working on recording the screen when I do these sessions, but in this video I haven't done so. So, if you want to go and find the comments that participants made during the session, here is the link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fb.watch/5mt62bRwOo/">https://fb.watch/5mt62bRwOo/</a><br /><br />If you enjoyed my video give it a thumbs up, subscribe to my channel and share it! <br /><br />WHO AM I?<br />I am Konstantina Kavvadia.
