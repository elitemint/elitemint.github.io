{% raw %}Are you suffering from Imposter Syndrome? Do you feel too young to be taken seriously? In this video I share my career advice for young professionals. Young professionals in the first years of their career often face many career challenges. In this video I talk about how to overcome imposter syndrome. Many professionals feel like a fraud, but they are not. This might be because they still might be perceived as too young to be taken seriously in consulting. I talk about how to deal imposter syndrome, how to build confidence, how to speak up and participate in meetings and share career advice and tips for young professionals.<br /><br />Chapters<br />00:00 Weekend in Italy and visiting Bocconi<br />01:12 Too young to work in Consulting?<br />02:53 Asking questions - the struggle is real<br />03:54 Making a good impression from the start?<br />05:05 Imposter syndrome can be crazy<br />07:23 Setting boundaries is tough<br />09:39 Specialization vs. Generalization<br />12:05 My tips for better communication<br /><br />üéì MY ONLINE COURSES*<br />Learn to make PowerPoint presentations like Top Management Consultants:<br />&quot;CEO-level Presentation Skills - Slide Writing for Consulting&quot;<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://link.firmlearning.com/slides">https://link.firmlearning.com/slides</a><br /><br />Learn to negotiate your salary and earn your worth:<br />&quot;The Complete Salary Negotiation Master Class - ASK for more&quot;<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://link.firmlearning.com/salarynegotiation">https://link.firmlearning.com/salarynegotiation</a><br /><br />Everything you need to know about Blockchain and Cryptocurrency:<br />&quot;The Complete Course on Blockchain and Bitcoin&quot;<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://link.firmlearning.com/blockchain">https://link.firmlearning.com/blockchain</a><br /><br />üìÑ CV AND COVER LETTER TEMPLATE*<br />Get a CV and cover letter template based on my own documents.
