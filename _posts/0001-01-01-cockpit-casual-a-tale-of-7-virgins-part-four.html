{% raw %}On the final installment of the four-part series, Steve and Jon complete one of the final re-deliveries of a Boeing 737-800 to Virgin Australia from the California Desert. Picking up where part 3 left off; on departure out of Honolulu, the route passes over Johnston Atoll (PJON) and then lands in Majuro, in the US Marshall Islands (PKMJ/MAJ) for fuel. <br /><br /> The episode features a real-time visual approach and landing, as well as the departure from Majuro from multiple cockpit camera views in 4K. The tiny atoll is gorgeous from the air, and the scenes are arguably among the best aviation-oriented Majuro content that can be found on the internet!<br /><br />Part 4 caps off the tale that follows our adventures moving 7 empty airliners from Australia to the United States in 2 multi-ship ferry flight operations, and then back to Brisbane on individual flights over a year. This episode features original Jazz from the Steve Giordano Spacetet and the Symbiosis Syndicate, Giordano Sr.'s avant-garde atmospheric improvisation group.<br /><br />#avgeek #aviation  #hawaii #travel #airplanes #pilot #airbus #vlog #docuseries #jazz #adventure #majuro #pilotview{% endraw %}
