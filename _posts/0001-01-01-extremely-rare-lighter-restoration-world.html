{% raw %}Restoration of an EXTREMLY RARE LIGHTER from World War II Battle of Bulge 1944. This was found near Bastogne and got a very special badge attached to it. See me restore this 84 years old war relic into something awesome.<br /><br />ABOUT THE RARE LIGHTER<br />This is a very special war relic from the Battle of Bulge World War 2 in 1944-1945. I have bought it from a family who lives near Bastogne where the Battle of Bulge took place. I got this old lighter and many other cool relics with me home including a Medicine bag a helmet and the famous whiskey hip flask that I already have restored ‚Äì See the video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/_Qjp5V5rWkg.">https://youtu.be/_Qjp5V5rWkg.</a> <br /><br />You can still go certain places in Europe and do some very cool World War 1 and World War 2 founds with and without metal detecting gear. There were millions of tons of military garbage and rare items left behind to be found. <br /><br />This item was found in the late 60‚Äôs early 70‚Äôs and brought to a barn where it has been contained together with a lot of other WW2 metal garbage, uniforms, helmets and other rusted materials. I was lucky to be able to buy a whole lot of relics from this family.  <br /><br />THE RESTORATION PROCESS<br />I was very curious about the badge who was attached to the lighter so I started cleaning this. When brushed off there was wings with a big A and some snakes and a needle maybe as old as World War I but I am not 100% sure. I have been told now by some of my subscribers from the US that it‚Äôs a WWII US Army Officer Ambulance Corps Medical Department Collar Insignia badge.<br /><br />I heated the lighter to remove the Ambulance Corps Medical badge which were soldered to the lighter and there after I removed all screws. They were hard to remove I had to use force and some flames to get things apart. <br /><br />I sandblasted the lighter using a mix of glass beads and baking soda and after the sandblasting I grinded the lighter with 1000, 1500 and 2000 grit. I polished it blank and added all the small parts again. I equipped it with a new cap for the wick since the old one seems to be missing. I used my metal lathe and I used brass to match the material used on the rest of this war relic. I also added new wick, cotton and a new flint spring to ensure that it will lit.<br /><br />The beautiful Ambulance Corps Medical badge was cleaned in vinegar and 40% alcohol before it was attached to the lighter again.<br />I hope that you enjoy this restoration video as much as I did.
