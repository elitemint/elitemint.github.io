{% raw %}Watching these scary videos can give you much more than a chilling fright. The entries in this list of creepy videos may etch eerie images in your head that could prove to be the perfect illustrations of your nightmares. From the recordings of real-life ghost encounters to the ominous incidents that came to pass in a haunted house, the scary comp you are about to watch has it all! That said, anyone whose mind ventures a bit too deeply into scary stories or horror flicks shouldn't really be watching this list of creepy videos. Because honestly, it can chill you to the bone — which is exactly what I felt when I first came across the entries included in this collection of scary videos.<br /> <br />Still, if you want to go ahead and watch this scary comp, always be aware of the fact that what you are seeing is happening on a screen and not in your real life — it will keep you disconnected from the endless horror these creepy videos have to offer. Bear this advice in mind because the list you are about to jump into contains scary videos that'll scare you real good — and you sure would need all the help you can get to watch these scary videos to the end!<br /> <br />Know your boundaries. For real. This list of top 15 scary videos will test your limits, and as a responsible horror fan, I must say that while analyzing these scary videos is as nerve-wracking as the ones you will find in this list, your own comfort is the most important. If you get a sense that the frights are too much for you to handle, don't watch these creepy videos. Seriously, watch something else, or just pick up a relaxing book instead that lets you escape into another world.<br /> <br />Have you ever — out of the corner of your eye — caught the sight of what you thought looked like a person? And it disappears when you try to get a good look? Well, while I was researching the eerie corners of the internet to put together this list of creepy videos, I noticed a weirdly-shaped, ghost-like head peeking out from the stairwell; and to my surprise, when I tried to get a good look at it, it was still there. The &quot;head&quot; slowly moved back behind the wall, and creepy chills began running up and down my spine. When I got up to go check it out, I found nothing. What freaks me out to this day is that I don't know if I truly saw a ghost or was my tired and scared mind playing one of its little tricks on me. Regardless, I think the slew of ghost encounter tapes that I watched that day played a role.<br /> <br />In conclusion, these are some of the scariest videos around — and the dread that will take residence in your mind after watching these creepy videos will be more than enough to give you endless nightmares. So, proceed at your own peril.<br /> <br />Done watching? That's great!<br />Which of these scary videos freaked you out of your wits the most?
