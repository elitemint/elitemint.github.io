{% raw %}The song  &quot;An Extra Spoon&quot; was inspired by &quot;The Spoon Theory&quot; written by Christine Miserandino.  Christine used the analogy of starting each day with a set number of spoons and having to give up a spoon with each daily task completed to explain what it is like to have a limiting chronic illness.  If you haven't read it before, I highly recommend it.  The process of researching and writing this song was so enlightening for me.  I hope you enjoy it.  Words are included below:<br /><br />An Extra Spoon - words by Dennis Robleski: music by Songmaker Productions <br /><br />Like a tortoise in a shell<br />Like breathing in thin air<br />There's a burden you carry<br />An affliction that you bear<br /><br />You thirst for the freedom<br />To make fewer choices<br />To improvise your day<br />To hear unfamiliar voices<br /><br />Please tell me what to say<br />When I don't understand<br />Teach me when to offer <br />The extra spoon in my hand<br /><br />When you need an extra spoon<br />Of compassion and love<br />Or on a cloudy afternoon<br />Need someone to understand<br />I want to be there for you<br />When you need an extra spoon<br /><br />A new verse on my wrist<br />A knock on a promised door<br />A slice of daily bread and<br />A hungry prayer for more<br /><br />I do these things for you<br />While in my heart I grieve<br />I'm powerless and limited<br />But I'm someone who believes<br /><br />When you need an extra spoon<br />Of compassion and love<br />Or on a cloudy afternoon<br />Need someone to understand<br />I want to be there for you<br />When you need an extra spoon<br /><br />I'll always bring a spoon<br />Since life takes yours away<br />Maybe we can laugh and pray<br />And hope for a good day<br /><br />When you need an extra spoon<br />Of compassion and love<br />Or on a cloudy afternoon<br />Need someone to understand<br />I want to be there for you<br />When you need an extra spoon<br /><br />And on a cloudy afternoon<br />I will be right there for you<br />When you need an extra spoon{% endraw %}
