The joys of last minute wrapping and a huge trip to the butchers puts us in stead for the big day upcoming...<br /><br />Me and mumma G do wish you all had a lovely Christmas and are sending all our love and wishes to you all!<br /><br /><br />If you have been following me for a while, you will know that in September I done a 10k charity run for Cancer Research UK. This is an illness that has affected several members of my family (including my little kitty Elvis in heaven) and I know that it has most definitely affected many, many other families. Any donations are greatly appreciated, but if you are unable to, thank you for taking the time to read this section:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fundraise.cancerresearchuk.org/page/shannons-race-for-life-3814">https://fundraise.cancerresearchuk.org/page/shannons-race-for-life-3814</a><br /><br />Fancy watching another video...have a look at the below playlists:<br /><br />'Time For A Getaway' Playlist: This is where you can find all our UK staycations and holidays abroad! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7i6EHFa5DKlk-FqjJIKG_oCCuDhzlPck">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7i6EHFa5DKlk-FqjJIKG_oCCuDhzlPck</a><br />'Autumn/Winter 2021...'
