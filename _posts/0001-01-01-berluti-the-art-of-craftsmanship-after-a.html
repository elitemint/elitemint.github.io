{% raw %}After a first edition in 2019, The Art of Craftsmanship is back to display Berluti’s most exceptional crafts, objects and designs. Housed on the 150 m2 space of the Faubourg Saint-Honoré store, the display is conceived as an intimate, apartment-like space where the Maison’s lifestyle philosophy - ranging from furniture to technology, gadgets and decorative objects to games and bespoke apparel - shines through.<br /><br />Starting around the patina bar, where images of Berluti’s most singular objects are displayed, the exhibition takes over the floor as a live space with rooms featuring golf bags and punching bags, the Berluti and Bang &amp; Olufsen collaboration, games including backgammon and chess, the Home &amp; Office objects collection, furniture and, of course, bespoke clothing and shoes. A perpetually evolving setting where every piece is craftsmanship by special order, The Art of Craftsmanship offers clients the chance to truly dive into Berluti’s artisanship, know-how and lifestyle.<br /><br />The Art of Craftsmanship pop-in is now open at the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré store in Paris.<br /><br />9 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré 75008 Paris, France.{% endraw %}
