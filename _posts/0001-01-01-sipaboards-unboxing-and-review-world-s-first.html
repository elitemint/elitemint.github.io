{% raw %}Today we are unboxing and testing SIPABOARDS - World's First Self-inflating Electric Powered SUP board. SIPABOARDS propulsion unit allows you to ride up to 3 hours with a top speed of 5 km/h - a fun ride for your whole family!<br /><br />The Tourer Drive Super Pack is an all-in-one limited edition SUP set that will take you further.<br /><br />The SipaBoards Tourer Drive is a board built for more. Faster, lighter and longer than other Drive Collection models, this spear-headed SUP will glide through streams wherever you take it. The extended waterline allows the SipaDrive to develop up to 7 km/h and add some power so that your rides can become full size explorations.<br /><br />Sleekly cut for easy maneuverability and low drag, the Tourer Drive is still a well balanced and considerably stiff board. A perfect choice for experienced paddlers and those who cannot stop exploring the coastline.<br /><br />The SipaBoards Tourer Drive Set includes:<br /><br />12‚Ä≤ MSL drop-stitch inflatable standup paddleboard<br />3 pc ultralight carbon fibre paddle (749 g)<br />Fully integrated jet engine and built-in compressor ‚Äì the SipaDrive¬Æ<br />144 Wh Battery pack<br />Wireless paddle-mount remote<br />Battery pack for the SipaDrive and charging cable<br />Deluxe carrying backpack<br />Board carrying strap<br />Front and rear carry handles<br />10‚Äô Coiled Safety leash<br />Free Mobile App<br /><br />more info on <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sipaboards.com/">https://sipaboards.com/</a><br /><br />===========================<br />Enjoying my videos?
