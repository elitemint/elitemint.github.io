{% raw %}Akka, actor systems and reactive programming are new trends in software development with Java and Scala. This talk dives into details of Akka usage with Scala.<br /><br />We will discuss different models of concurrency handling and the actor model in particular. The particular implementation of the model we will be talking about is Akka, a system that supports writing code with the actor model in Java, Scala and .net. We will cover how actors send messages to each other via mailboxes and dispatchers, will take a look at the supervision hierarchy and error handling with the error kernel pattern.<br /><br />In addition to the theoretical section we will also discuss a few projects where Planet OS has used Akka and the actor model to achieve high reliability systems:<br /><br />- an operational dashboard for the world's second largest offshore wind park<br />- DPipe, the highly configurable data processing pipeline that is doing the heavy lifting behind <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://data.planetos.com,">http://data.planetos.com,</a> our universal data access api.<br /><br />Advanced Java Meetup March 31, 2016<br />Reactive Programming with Akka<br /><br />Slides available here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1TBBpPa">http://bit.ly/1TBBpPa</a>{% endraw %}
