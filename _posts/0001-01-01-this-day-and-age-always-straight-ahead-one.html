{% raw %}one of my favorite songs. ever.<br /><br />i've noted there aren't any videos besides live shows for the song, so i decided to put one up myself.<br />the band is no longer together, to my regret, but i still love their music.<br /><br />the copyright still goes to them, and their record [fueled by ramen i think?]{% endraw %}
