{% raw %}How do you talk to someone who is intolerant of people who are different or who hold different beliefs and opinions than your own? How do you have a conversation with someone who is so rigid in their beliefs that they can’t see beyond their anger? How do you persuade them to listen to reason? What a shock it is to realize that the very act of sitting in judgement of bigots, makes you a bigot. You are what you hate.<br /><br />Doug Stevenson, CSP, is the CEO of Story Theater International, based in Tucson, Arizona. He is the creator of The Story Theater Method and a master storyteller and storytelling keynote speaker, trainer and coach. <br /><br />Doug has taught storytelling for business success to a diverse group of clients that include Google, Coca-Cola, Deloitte, Caterpillar, Pfizer, among many others. <br />After several decades of working as a professional actor, he began teaching The Story Theater Method in 1996, and since that time has helped tens of thousands of business professionals and hundreds of companies and associations in 16 countries to find, craft and tell their compelling stories. <br /><br />Doug is an avid runner, a Gluten free pizza lover and a happy grandpa.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
