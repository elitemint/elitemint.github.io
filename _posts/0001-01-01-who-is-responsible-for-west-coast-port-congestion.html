{% raw %}November 17, 2021 <br /><br />On this episode of What's Going on With Shipping, host Sal Mercogliano - Chair of the Department of History, Criminal Justice, and Political Science, former merchant mariner, and instructor of Maritime History, Security and Industry Policy - discusses how the introduction of Ultra Large Container Vessels (ULCVs) to the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, starting with CMA CGM Benjamin Franklin, has impacted the ports and contributed to the issues of congestion we are facing today.  We also see how Long Beach and the Chinese Overseas Shipping Company (COSCO) has been able able to alleviate much of this with the upgrade of the Long Beach Container Terminal (LBCT). <br /><br />00:00 Intro <br />03:59 Ben Franklin ULCV arrival 2015<br />11:06 Marco Polo ULCV arrival 2021 <br />15:25 Long Beach vs Los Angeles <br /><br />Port of Los Angeles: Arrival of CMA CGM Benjamin Franklin<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/uRXbIYVVIEs">https://youtu.be/uRXbIYVVIEs</a><br /><br />First Mega Containership Coming to United States<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gcaptain.com/first-mega-containership-coming-to-united-states/#.Vn7b3ZODGko">https://gcaptain.com/first-mega-containership-coming-to-united-states/#.Vn7b3ZODGko</a><br /><br />U.S. West Coast Ports Not Ready for Mega Boxships, Drewry Says<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gcaptain.com/u-s-west-coast-not-ready-for-mega-boxships-drewry-says/#.Vn7eFJODGko">https://gcaptain.com/u-s-west-coast-not-ready-for-mega-boxships-drewry-says/#.Vn7eFJODGko</a><br /><br />Photos: First Ultra-Large Containership Arrives in the United States<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gcaptain.com/photos-first-ultra-large-containership-benjamin-franklin-arrives-in-the-united-states/">https://gcaptain.com/photos-first-ultra-large-containership-benjamin-franklin-arrives-in-the-united-states/</a><br /><br />Big Ben – Photo Tour Of The MegaShip Benjamin Franklin<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gcaptain.com/big-ben-photo-tour-of-the-megaship-benjamin-franklin/">https://gcaptain.com/big-ben-photo-tour-of-the-megaship-benjamin-franklin/</a><br /><br />SPOTD: Megaship CMA CGM Benjamin Franklin Returns to U.S.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gcaptain.com/spotd-megaship-cma-cgm-benjamin-franklin-returns-to-u-s/">https://gcaptain.com/spotd-megaship-cma-cgm-benjamin-franklin-returns-to-u-s/</a><br /><br />CMA CGM to Deploy Six Megaships to U.S. West Coast<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gcaptain.com/cma-cgm-to-deploy-six-megaships-to-u-s-west-coast/">https://gcaptain.com/cma-cgm-to-deploy-six-megaships-to-u-s-west-coast/</a><br /><br />CMA CGM Benjamin Franklin Pulled from Trans-Pacific Market, Ending U.S. West Ports’ Mega-Ship Plans<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gcaptain.com/cma-cgm-benjamin-franklin-pulled-from-trans-pacific-market-ending-u-s-west-ports-mega-ship-plans/">https://gcaptain.com/cma-cgm-benjamin-franklin-pulled-from-trans-pacific-market-ending-u-s-west-ports-mega-ship-plans/</a><br /><br />Port of Long Beach Chief Sees More Pain for Shipping Lines<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gcaptain.com/port-of-long-beach-chief-sees-more-pain-for-shipping-lines/">https://gcaptain.com/port-of-long-beach-chief-sees-more-pain-for-shipping-lines/</a><br /><br />Shipping Alliances from 1996 to 2020 <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://i1.wp.com/porteconomicsmanagement.org/wp-content/uploads/Alliances.png?resize=900%2C505&amp;ssl=1">https://i1.wp.com/porteconomicsmanagement.org/wp-content/uploads/Alliances.png?resize=900%2C505&amp;ssl=1</a><br /><br />What's Going on In Shipping?
