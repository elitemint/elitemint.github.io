{% raw %}Thanks to intelligent lightweight construction technology, the lightweight yet highly stable Malibu motorhome range has lost more than 20 kg in the 2022 model year - without any loss of quality or stability. All Malibu motorhomes are based on a gross vehicle weight of 3.5 tonnes. The new standard XL body door &quot;premium two 2.0&quot; has a double safety lock, attractive interior paneling, a large door window and a passage width of 63 cm.<br /><br />In 2022 there are eight integrated and seven partially integrated motorhomes between 6.66 and 7.50 m in length.<br /><br />The Malibu base vehicle, the Fiat Ducato, will see a major leap forward in the 2022 model year. It benefits from the new generation of Multijet 3 engines with a displacement of 2.2 l. It complies with the Euro 6d or Euro VI-E emissions standard. There is also electric power steering, a comprehensively renewed dashboard, additional assistance systems and optional LED headlights and keyless entry &amp; go access for vans. Manual air conditioning, front passenger airbags, cruise control and start-stop systems are now standard features of every Malibu. Malibu has combined attractive extras such as a digital instrument cluster, multifunction leather steering wheel and a multimedia system including navigation and motorhome route guidance as well as the Van Keyless Entry &amp; Go into an infotainment package.<br /><br /><br />I live in a motorhome full time and travel around Europe in it.  I spend most of my time in Poland, Germany and Italy.  Vanlife is my life. <br /><br />In my YouTube channel, I present reviews of recreational vehicles.

I try to give as much coverage as I can to official campsites and free places which I use for overnighting.  Therefore you can find here the aire or stellplatz that you are possibly looking for.<br /><br />Please consider supporting me on Patreon : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/alanheath">https://www.patreon.com/alanheath</a>{% endraw %}
