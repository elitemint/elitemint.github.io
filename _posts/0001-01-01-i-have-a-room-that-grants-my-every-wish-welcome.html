{% raw %}Welcome to the Here’s My Story channel. I’m Lucy. My dad was about to toss a coin he was holding in his hand. He turned to my sister and me. “Alright young ladies, tell me: Heads or tails?” My sister Violet said, with her usual brattiness, “Why do we need to toss a coin? I want that room. Don’t you love me?” My mom couldn’t stand seeing her favorite daughter sad. “Honey, how can you say that? Of course, we love you. We love you so much!” she said as she turned to look at me. “Lucy, why don’t you accommodate your little sister? Let her have the room she wants!”{% endraw %}
