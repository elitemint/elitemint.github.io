{% raw %}Yellowstone National Park rangers say that something huge has just been detected under Yellowstone. Today, we take a look at what this Yellowstone National Park ranger said is happening in Yellowstone right now.<br /><br />Over 50 earthquakes have hit Yellowstone National Park in the last week, with park officials noting that one of those was the biggest of the year. It was a 3.3 magnitude earthquake, and interestingly this is happening very close to where the uplift has been detected. These Earthquake clusters have been hitting Yellowstone hard in the last few years, with a team of researchers noting that recent activity has been hitting the park deep under Yellowstone Lake.<br /><br />The United States geological survey has said that they are still learning new things about Yellowstone National Park....<br /><br />Thank you for watching!<br /><br />Thank you to CO.AG for the background music!{% endraw %}
