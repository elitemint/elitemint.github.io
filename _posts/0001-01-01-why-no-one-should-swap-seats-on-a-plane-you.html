{% raw %}You probably aren’t the only one looking to pull the ol’ switcharoo. Even if just a few passengers do it, they could throw the plane off balance! And since most aircraft are incredibly sensitive to changes in their center of gravity, it can lead to dramatic consequences. <br /><br />During takeoff, pilots must know the distribution of weight on the plane to make exact calculations. If these calculations are off even the slightest, there are chances that the aircraft can crash while leaving the ground. So before nestling in a more comfortable or spacious spot, ask a cabin crew member if you're allowed to do so.  <br /><br />Other videos you might like:<br />What Will Happen If Planes Fly Almost to Space <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXtNco_oA_Y&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXtNco_oA_Y&amp;</a><br />Pilots Reveal 16 Nuances That Make Your Flight Safe <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVYXErxau-U&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVYXErxau-U&amp;</a><br />What Happens When a Bird Flies Into a Plane Engine <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozYL-_ttEc&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozYL-_ttEc&amp;</a><br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br />You can cause problems controlling the plane! 0:24<br />Other things to know for a safe flight:<br />- Your tray table 2:16<br />- Your seat 2:32<br />- Size matters 2:54<br />- Sitting near an emergency exit 3:07<br />- Window shades 3:29<br />- Fly non-stop 3:54<br />- Wear proper clothing 4:39<br />- Prepare a &quot;run kit&quot; 6:26<br />- Strange-looking packages 7:40<br />- What about the safest sea? 7:58<br /><br />#planes #safety #brightside<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />- If the calculations are off even the slightest, there are chances that the aircraft can crash while leaving the ground. <br />- By the way, if the airport staff load baggage incorrectly, for example, in the rear compartment instead of the front one, it can also mess with the plane's balance. <br />- Always secure your tray table as soon as the plane starts moving on the tarmac, and never lower it during takeoff and landing.<br />- Like a lowered tray table, a reclined seat can seriously slow down an evacuation since it’ll block the person sitting behind you.<br />- If you’re on a larger aircraft, you have higher chances of surviving a possible accident. <br />- Remember that sitting near an emergency exit means not only more leg room but also more responsibility. That's why only able-bodied adults can occupy such seats.<br />- Follow cabin crew instructions to open window shades during takeoff and landing. This way, flight attendants can see what's happening outside.<br />- Fly non-stop without connections if you can. An overwhelming majority of plane crashes happen during the first 3 and last 8 minutes of the flight. <br />- Wearing proper clothing will reduce your risks during air travel. Try to wear clothes made of natural fibers such as wool, cotton, leather, and denim.<br />- Prepare a &quot;run kit&quot; and make sure it's with you at all times. Such a kit should contain your passport, wallet, cell phone, credit cards and cash, any necessary medications, and a list of emergency contacts. <br />- Don't stuff heavy objects into overhead lockers. They can fall out during severe turbulence and injure you or other passengers.<br />- If you see some suspicious activity or strange-looking packages, immediately inform the cabin crew.<br />- It might be a waste of time to look for the safest seat on the plane because it probably doesn’t exist. <br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />Stock materials (photos, footages and other):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.depositphotos.com">https://www.depositphotos.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shutterstock.com">https://www.shutterstock.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eastnews.ru">https://www.eastnews.ru</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>{% endraw %}
