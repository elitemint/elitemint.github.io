And there's a good reason behind it. In this video, we will look at some of the reasons why no one has wolves as pets, but before we get into that, we will also look at some animals that just don't make good pets. <br />Number 10. Big Cats<br />In 2012, estimates for the number of privately owned big cats ranged from 10,000 to 20,000, and currently, the number of tigers living in captivity greatly outnumbers those that are still living in the wild. Yes, it's as crazy as it sounds! The total number of wild tigers is around 3,900, and, in the U.S., alone, there are approximately 5,000 tigers in captivity. Thus, owning a big cat as a pet is a conservation nightmare. The requirement of a big pet cat involves splitting up a cub from its mother, which is incredibly traumatic for them both. The mother may also be kept in captivity and forced to undergo this painful separation over and over. However, some big cats in the big cat pet trade are also taken from the wild, which is terrible for conserving big cat populations.<br />Furthermore, while the cub may start out small and cute, they grow to be quite large. This is a problem because many people cannot provide an appropriate amount of space for these animals and big cats are predators. As the big cat grows larger and more stressed out, likely suffering from zoochosis, they could attack and overpower someone who approaches them. Because these cats have been raised around humans, they can never be released back into the wild, which further debunks any &quot;conservation&quot; excuse that private big cat owners try to use.<br />Number 9. Chimpanzees and Other Primates<br />From Ross' pet monkey on Friends to Tarzan's sidekick, Cheeta, has Hollywood left you with the notion that a pet primate could be fun? In the real world, there are a number of reasons it's not a good idea. These independent and highly intelligent creatures become bigger, stronger, and harder to manage over time. They can carry everything from parasites and ringworm to life-threatening Ebola, Marburg, and rabies viruses. Chimpanzees are terribly dangerous and powerful animals, as proven in the multiple tragic attack says. Furthermore, if you are thinking of owning a chimp as a pet, you might as well just go ahead and have a baby. You're that close. Though a number of states prohibit the possession of apes and monkeys as pets, such as California and Georgia, many Americans continue to bring them into their homes. <br />Number 8. Most Birds<br />Most birds fly. It's the first association most people would make when they think of a bird. Sadly, people who decide to keep birds as pets leave them in cages for their whole lives. It's also a common practice in Asian countries to buy birds with clipped wings so that the bird can no longer fly. Even though this means that the bird might not be kept in a cage all day, every day, they still had to suffer an unnecessary and traumatizing loss. Plus, many birds that people choose to buy as pets are endangered and smuggled in extremely inhumane conditions. In captivity, birds suffer from stress, loneliness, and premature death. They are complex beings who need more stimulation than they can get from perching in a small cage or hopping around someone's room.<br /> Number 7. Kinkajous<br />These small, rainforest-dwelling animals may be cute — but making one your pet is a bad idea. Kinkajous are wild animals that have been known to scratch, bite, and injure their owners.<br />In fact, when 16-year-old Jada Thurmond recently showed up to a hospital in Chattanooga, Tenn., complaining of terrible stomach pain, severe headaches, and high fevers, her doctors had a hard time diagnosing her — until she fingered the culprit: Her aunt's pet kinkajou, which bit her the day before. Soon enough, her doctors discovered that kinkajous carry the bacteria Kingella potus, which triggered Thurmond's symptoms.<br />Beyond the health risk for humans, owning a kinkajou is bad for the animal, too. Replicating their rainforest environment can be pretty tricky, and their strange surroundings can increase their risk for disease and ruin their quality of life.<br />Number 6.
