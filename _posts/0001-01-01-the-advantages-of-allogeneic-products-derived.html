{% raw %}LaQuisa Hill, MD, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX, describes the role of allogeneic products in treating B-cell and T-cell lymphomas. Using healthy donor cells to manufacture allogeneic therapies can increase overall quality and expedite treatment in patients. Despite graft versus host disease (GvHD) being a concern, such cases have not been seen in patients. Dr Hill additionally highlights the development of anti-CD37 allogeneic products. This interview took place at the 63rd ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition congress in Atlanta, GA.{% endraw %}
