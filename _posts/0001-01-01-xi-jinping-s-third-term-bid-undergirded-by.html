{% raw %}Xi Jinping’s bid for a third term as China’s president is undergirded by a desire to create a “personality cult” to own the legacies of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, says Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s Michael Shoebridge. <br /><br />Some 400 Chinese Communist Party officials are currently in a four-day plenum which is expected to adopt a “historical resolution” in celebration of the party’s achievement over the course of it’s 100-year history.<br /> <br />Resolutions, which have previously only been ratified on two occasions, has historically cemented the power of the CCP’s leader. <br /><br />Mr Shoebridge believes Xi’s latest manoeuvre is an attempt at broadcasting an “image of strength”.<br /><br />“What Xi is trying to do is own the legacies of Mao and Deng,” he told Sky News Australia.<br /><br />“Mao had China stand up to the world, Deng made China rich and Xi wants to say, I own both those legacies and I’m making China strong. <br /><br />“He wants to create a broadcast of this image of strength for the party and for himself and that’s partly because there’s so much weakness and trouble going on inside China right now.<br /><br />&quot;Xi needs to distract them from that and unify the party behind him before he goes for his third term in the party congress meeting next year: that’s what this is about.”{% endraw %}
