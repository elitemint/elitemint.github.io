{% raw %}Late Afternoon stroll in the sand at Barceloneta Beach. It was quite packed in earlier hours, but at this time was quieter. Good walk nonetheless.<br /><br />Around 3:20 mark you can witness how a woman slip off a bench and falls.<br /><br />Barcelona city coastline is made up of six beaches in a single stretch of line: San Sebastián, La Barceloneta, Somorrostro, Nova Icaria, Bogatell, Mar Bella and Nova Mar Bella.<br /><br />There is a good assortment of restaurants and beach bars along the main beaches. During the summer hundreds of people gather in the sand to start a party.<br /><br />This is a newly created channel and I'm publishing at least two videos a week. Please consider subscribe if you want to see more content and hit the 'Like' button if you enjoy my videos.<br /><br />This channel features relaxing strolls on the beach with the sound of breaker waves washing the shore and exiting walks on the animated buzzing of beach bars and hectic characters.<br /><br />Beaches have a world on their own, from urban beaches to remote coves. The lively atmosphere of Ipanema, La Barceloneta or Maspalomas, to the inner peace of Famara or Cofete.<br /><br />If you are planning a trip to any of the places I depict in my videos, I hope you find them useful, as this is my main intention.<br /><br />Please feel free to leave a comment with your feedback and suggestions.{% endraw %}
