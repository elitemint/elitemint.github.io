{% raw %}Before you do anything intentional, get familiar with your target skill or field.<br /><br />Try things, explore, get stuck, and become comfortable.<br /><br />After that, the material you intend to learn have some kind of experiential root to hang onto.<br /><br />You can say there are two levels of learning.<br /><br />First, experience. Second, understanding.<br /><br />Without the experience, you cannot quickly understand.<br /><br />So, if you want to learn how to navigate a town, move through it.<br /><br />If you want to learn a language, listen to it all the time.<br /><br />Familiarity will give you a background for rapid learning.{% endraw %}
