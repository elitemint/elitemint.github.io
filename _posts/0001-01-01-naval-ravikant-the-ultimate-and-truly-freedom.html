{% raw %}Naval and Kapil immerse into a debate of what is the ultimate and truly freedom (and consequently, peace)  and what does someone needs to do in order to achieve.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />----- Source -----<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1wuDemH4zo&amp;ab_channel=ClubhousePodcast">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1wuDemH4zo&amp;ab_channel=ClubhousePodcast</a><br /><br /><br />----- Connect with me :) ----- <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/PickingNuggets">https://twitter.com/PickingNuggets</a><br /><br />#Naval #Ravikant #Clubhouse<br /><br />---- Notes -----<br /><br />- The ultimate Freedom is to be free from the mind. It is the mind that imprisons/confines you through its creation of anxieties, conflicts, rules... <br /><br /> - How can we get free from the mind? From an understanding of where the relevant things/feelings come from and the definition of those things. Of course, that implies to use the mind, but if it is done with sincerity and seriousness it becomes its own instrument of examination.<br /><br />It is better to be wealthy and healthy, but the reason why the ultimate freedom is not a physical freedom is that that doesn't change your character/inner self. It doesn't change who you are. So it may solve your money and health problems, but there is still tons of things that are enough to perturb your peace. So your &quot;baseline peace level&quot; is not changed by so much. <br /><br />On physical freedom --- Any freedom that leads to the desire for more freedom, is not freedom<br /><br />Most people chase physical freedom because they have the belief that the source of fear, anxiety, and other feelings come from the circumstances of oneself. But circumstances only reveal parts of oneself, which then causes the feeling. So, all conflicts are essentially self-conflicts.<br /><br />THE LOW-LEVEL ANXIETY / How to get rid of the low-level and persistent non-specific anxiety that we all have? The way to do it, is to understand what this anxiety is and from where is it coming from (this examination process is true for anything that you want to overcome!).<br /><br />Understanding / It is only through understanding, that you can take your destiny in your own hands. <br /><br />For the example in which you are motivating/inspiring someone,  or receiving compliments. Generally, this make us feel good. But is the understanding of why is making us feel good that gives us freedom. For this example, we feel good because you are building a self-image or feeding your ego as a result of these actions.{% endraw %}
