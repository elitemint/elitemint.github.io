{% raw %}About 18,000 years ago, dogs were on their way on becoming man’s best friend. Domestication is the process of adapting wild plants and animals for human use and domestic species are raised for food, work, clothing, medicine, and many other uses. Yes! Dogs weren’t the only species that became domesticated by our ancestors. There are many other plants and animals that were cared for by humans.<br /><br />The first attempts at domestication of animals and plants apparently were made in the Old World during the Mesolithic Period.Most of the domestic animals familiar to us today were domesticated not long after people began farming and living in permanent settlements, between 8000 and 2500 BC. As for plants, people first domesticated plants about 10,000 years ago, collecting and planting the seeds of wild plants, making sure they got as much water and sun as they needed to grow.<br />#domestication #pets #humancivilization<br /><br /><br />Halabella does not own the rights to these videos and pictures.
