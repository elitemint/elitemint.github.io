He also describes how to break in new speakers after they're installed.<br /><br />To view the wiring diagrams for this project, visit premierguitar.com/4x12-wiring. (This diagram is also embedded in the video.) <br /><br />Bonus! Want to hear a 1968 Marshall half-stack in action? Check out the short demo following Part 2 of this how-to video.{% endraw %}
