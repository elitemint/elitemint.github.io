{% raw %}If you are mountain biker looking for a light weight, slim and aggressively styled helmet I would seriously consider the Impala.  The adjustable visor can now accommodate goggles so this could be a great option for Enduro racers too.  It works well for short punchy mtb rides, as well as long days in the saddle.  Personally I love the profile and fit.   <br /><br />The Impala comes standard with MIPs to reduce rotational impacts.  And the EPS foam is partially coated on the underside to increase its durability.  The 22 vents provide tons of air flow for a comfortable ride.  Finally the helmet is available in several color options and comes with a carrying pouch and a GoPro mount.  <br /><br />If you have any questions leave them in the comments below.
