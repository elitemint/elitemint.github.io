{% raw %}These crews have it down to a science, the ballet of spinning cranes strategically moving multi-ton steel beams as if playing chess, putting each one where it needs to be for maximum speed! When the beam is lowered into its slot, the crews at 60-80 feet (18-24 meters) high walk around and move as if rooted firmly on the ground. No crew on the planet can match the dexterity, speed and quality of the crews of Giga Texas! Also, an update on the new Supercharger station at 969 and a mini Boring update!<br /><br />Please enjoy the video and as always, I appreciate all comments, questions, statements, proclamations and otherwise below!<br /><br />If you enjoy this content and want more such as behind the scenes and b-roll, please consider supporting me on Patreon at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/gigafactoryaustindronevideo">https://www.patreon.com/gigafactoryaustindronevideo</a><br />Or please consider a one-time contribution via PayPal at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/peterdog?locale.x=en_US">https://paypal.me/peterdog?locale.x=en_US</a> or drop some Bitcoin in my wallet here: 3QR1ApDVv6V1sEvApXnfNu42oKK9vRhBPp<br />Venmo: @AustinBounceHouseRentals<br /><br />Get your OFFICIAL Swampy tribute T-Shirt here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://giga-texas-merch.company.site/">https://giga-texas-merch.company.site/</a><br />THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!!<br /><br />#gigatexas #tesla #cybertruck<br /><br />QUAD SQUAD CHANNELS <br /><br />Jack - Texas Terafactory<br />For 4K flights over new areas and “first looks”, there’s no better source than:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDX-oB1LsCDJqeUNV1i58Sg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDX-oB1LsCDJqeUNV1i58Sg</a><br /><br />Randy - Terafactory Texas<br />For a unique perspective and consistent updates later in the day that show progress within a single day, your must-view source is:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUZVh4M6Gybjm68y_BBl2bQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUZVh4M6Gybjm68y_BBl2bQ</a><br /><br />Joe - Joe Tegtmeyer<br />For deep-dives into the mechanics of construction, indications of future plans and overall comprehensive coverage, your go-to source is:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4UwT7zCc-T_BN9_E45FVNA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4UwT7zCc-T_BN9_E45FVNA</a><br /><br />Jeff (me) - Jeff Roberts<br />And for your daily fix for 4K cinematic fly-overs with occasional “celebrity” appearances, the place to be is:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDmfM1DRiTC9E7fuBbul2SQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDmfM1DRiTC9E7fuBbul2SQ</a><br /><br />Together, we are the “Quad Squad” and there’s no better coverage of Giga Texas anywhere!<br />Equipment used:<br />iPhone 11 Pro Max<br />DJI Mavic Air 2<br />DJI Mavic 2 Zoom <br />DJI Smart Controller <br />DJI Mavic Mini 2<br />Autel EVO II 8K (used on this video)<br />Blackmagic Pocket Cinema 4K <br /><br />Music in this video:<br />Artist:  Jesse Gallagher (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/nightimegallagher)">https://youtube.com/nightimegallagher)</a><br />Song: &quot;The Golden Present&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It is my pleasure and an absolute honor to be &quot;gifted&quot; the access to sit in the front row of the world theater to witness the best performance of human progress yet!&quot; - Jeff Roberts 2020{% endraw %}
