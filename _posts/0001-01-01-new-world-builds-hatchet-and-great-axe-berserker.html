{% raw %}New World Build Guide for the Hatchet and Great Axe. This Hatchet Build Guide focuses on surviveability and damage, and is excellent for the solo player who may be having a hard time. This Build is also fantastic in Expeditions, group play, and in PvP, making it one of the best all around Builds in New World. If you’ve been looking for a great Hatchet Build, then this Guide is for you.<br /><br />Build: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fextralife.com/new-world-builds-hatchet-great-axe-guide-berserker/">https://fextralife.com/new-world-builds-hatchet-great-axe-guide-berserker/</a><br />More Builds: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://newworld.wiki.fextralife.com/Builds">https://newworld.wiki.fextralife.com/Builds</a><br /><br />The way this Build works is that you’ll use the Hatchet in one-on-one situations to deal incredible damage with Berserk. Hatchets have some of, if not the most, single target DPS in New World, and Berserk increases your damage even further while healing you over time. You’ll use your other Hatchet Skills: Raging Torrent and Feral Rush when they are off cooldown to further boost damage, and you’ll swap to your Great Axe when facing multiple enemies.<br /><br />If you pull too many enemies, or you are simply facing larger groups of them, like in an Expedition, then you’ll use your Great Axe to take care of them. The Great Axe has wide horizontal strokes that can hit multiple enemies, and Maelstrom and Gravity Well are key.<br /><br />Gravity Well can keep enemies grouped up, and deals more damage the more enemies caught in it once upgraded. Maelstrom can hit enemies two times once upgraded in a very large AoE, making it ideal for these types of situations. You can also use Reap for even more AoE, though in a much smaller area.<br /><br />Timestamp<br />0:00 ​- New World Hatchet and Great Axe<br />1:06 ​- Hatchet and Great Axe Build Attributes<br />1:48 - Hatchet and Great Axe Build Skills<br />4:15 ​- Hatchet and Great Axe Build Weapons<br />4:56 ​- Hatchet and Great Axe Build Armor<br />5:30 ​- Final Tips<br /><br />Remember that Berserk does not remain if you swap to your Great Axe, so only use it when you plan to stay on the Hatchet for its duration. This is important, because you might need the healing from it, and swapping weapons at the wrong time could get you killed. Additionally, Defy Death won’t trigger if your Hatchet is not out, so swap to it when you are at low health.<br /><br />Both the Hatchet and Great Axe deal Slash Damage, which isn’t ideal if enemies resist this type of damage. Thankfully, this is not common, but you may want to consider leveling up your War Hammer Skills as well just in case you run into an area that’s giving you trouble. You can usually DPS through the resistant enemies anyway, because this Build is strong, but having a back up Hammer won’t hurt.<br /><br />Lead with your Great Axe when facing groups, otherwise use your Hatchet when questing and facing solo enemies as it has better DPS. You can round up enemies and then AoE them down for a good time, and a lot of Weapon XP if you play it right, so don’t waste opportunities to do this when you can.<br /><br />Lastly, you can animation cancel out of Berserk by pressing Block or Dodging immediately after using it. You don’t need to do this all the time, but it can be a lifesaver in PvP, or in fights where you cannot get any separation. Get in the habit of doing this, as it can really help out.<br /><br />Don't forget to like the video and subscribe to our channel for more!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/fextralife">https://www.twitch.tv/fextralife</a><br /><br />Follow us on social media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Fextralife/">https://www.facebook.com/Fextralife/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Fextralife">https://twitter.com/Fextralife</a><br />Visit our wikis: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wiki.fextralife.com/">https://www.wiki.fextralife.com/</a><br />Check out our blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fextralife.com/">https://fextralife.com/</a><br />Visit our forums: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fextralife.com/forums/">https://fextralife.com/forums/</a><br /><br />#newworld ​#newworldbuilds ​#newworldguide<br /><br />new world,new world mmo,new world build,new world builds,new world pve,new world pve build,new world pve builds,new world great axe build,new world hatchet build,new world great axe hatchet build,pve build,new world melee build,op new world build,best new world build,new world pve great axe build,new world pve hatchet build,hatchet pve,new world tips,new world pve guide,new world expedition build,hatchet pvp,hatchet build,new world crit build{% endraw %}
