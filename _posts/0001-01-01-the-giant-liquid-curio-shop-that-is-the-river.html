{% raw %}The River Thames can be like a giant fleamarket or carboot sale sometimes - with all sorts of odd bits and pieces left out at low tide to find.  These are things that you wouldn't look twice at in a curio shop - but somehow the act of finding them makes them precious and special! <br /><br />Today I find a varied collection of objects - and then I meet up with Anna Borzello and Monika Buttling-Smith for lark in the sludgy mud.<br /><br />You can follow Anna on instagram @foreshoreseashore and you can follow Monika @mudika.thames.  You can follow me on twitter and instagram @tidelineart <br /><br />You need a permit to mudlark on the River Thames.  Details can be found on the Port of London Authority website.<br /><br />Thank you for watching. See you soon.<br /><br />Nicola<br /><br />Nicola White<br />www.tidelineart.com{% endraw %}
