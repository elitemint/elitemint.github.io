When does it become high BP? What is the difference between Stage 1 and Stage 2 high BP? Did you know that any BP value, above 180 mm Hg is an emergency situation? One of the most common reasons why blood pressure doesn't get controlled is because of the ignorance on the patient's side to identify a BP reading as high, normal, or urgent! In this video, Ansar Pulikkal Health Inspector explains the different types of BP categories based on the American Heart Association recommendations.<br /><br />#NormalBP #BPChart #BPRange #HighBP #BloodPressure #Hypertension #Telemedicine #Online DoctorConsultation #Malayalam{% endraw %}
