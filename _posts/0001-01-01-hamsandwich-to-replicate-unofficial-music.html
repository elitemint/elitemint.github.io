{% raw %}Hamsandwich:<br />One of the most enthralling live acts in recent times, HamsandwicH are well known for their incendiary live performances which has put them right at the top of the live acts to see today. With the combination of Niamh Farrell's powerful yet sweet vocal and Podge McNamee's juxtaposing baritone the band are given it's signature calling card. If ever there was a band to feed off their audience it is HamsandwicH. Each show is bona fide celebration with everything from balloons and confetti to their unique crowd interaction on display. <br />Number 1 album Stories from the Surface is out now.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.hamsandwichmusic.com/shop.html">http://www.hamsandwichmusic.com/shop.html</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.hamsandwichmusic.com/">http://www.hamsandwichmusic.com/</a><br />HAMSANDWICHMUSIC@GMAIL.COM<br /><br />Cast:<br />Br√≥na Howard<br /><br />Crew:<br />Killian Ginnity [Director/Editor]<br />Yee Wen Wong [Producer]<br />Dean Gordon [Ast.
