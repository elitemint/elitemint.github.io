{% raw %}Guy Wolff is America‚Äôs cherished potter, specializing in horticultural wares, but every now and then he takes a break from making flower pots to create pieces of pottery that serve more as an artistic statement rather than a functional piece. <br /><br />12 years ago, Rajiv Surendra called Guy on the phone asking him to apprentice with him, and Guy politely declined. Fast forward to today, Rajiv and Guy have made countless flower pots together, sharing a love and passion for pottery. Today, he‚Äôll be teaching Rajiv the art of stoneware pottery and the meticulous and lengthy process that goes into it. Watch the entrancing art form of making stoneware pieces that are made to last for centuries. <br /><br />You can find the step-by-step process of Guy Wolff‚Äôs tutorial here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hg.tv/3FEhxGd">https://hg.tv/3FEhxGd</a> <br /><br />Check out guywolff.com for more information about his shop, how to contact him and where to buy his pieces.<br />Find him on Instagram @wolfpottery<br /><br />Check out Lizzie‚Äôs handcrafted lamps on Instagram @piercedtinlamps <br /><br />Watch more videos with Rajiv:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Uo2nomf4I0&amp;list=PLPBX4CwI7bw_UYpWmsBj6x7NYkgn2sjb7">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Uo2nomf4I0&amp;list=PLPBX4CwI7bw_UYpWmsBj6x7NYkgn2sjb7</a><br /><br />Subscribe and follow HGTV Handmade for more crafty inspiration:<br />‚ñ∂Ô∏è SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=hgtvhandmade">http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=hgtvhandmade</a><br />üì∏ INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hgtvhandmade/">https://www.instagram.com/hgtvhandmade/</a><br />üëª SNAPCHAT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Handmade/4960596384">https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Handmade/4960596384</a><br />üó£Ô∏è FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/hgtvhandmade">https://www.facebook.com/hgtvhandmade</a><br />‚è∞ TIKTOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hgtvhandmade">https://www.tiktok.com/@hgtvhandmade</a><br />üè† ON HGTV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hgtv.com/hgtvhandmade">https://www.hgtv.com/hgtvhandmade</a> <br /><br />For more HGTV around the web, check out:<br />HGTV YouTube Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/hgtv">http://www.youtube.com/hgtv</a><br />HGTV on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/hgtv">http://www.twitter.com/hgtv</a><br />HGTV on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/HGTV">http://www.facebook.com/HGTV</a>{% endraw %}
