{% raw %}Ira and Louis are back for the final show of 2021 to discuss the outrage over Time Magazine naming Elon Musk their Person of the Year. Then, they turn their attention to looking back at the best film and television performances of 2021. <br /><br />CHAPTERS<br />0:00 Cold Open<br />0:49 Time Magazine Picks Elon Musk for Person of the Year<br />5:00 Jean Smart and Kate Winslet in Mare of Easttown<br />7:35 Elizabeth Olsen in Wandavision<br />11:55 Ruth Negga in Passing<br />14:02 Ariana DeBose and Mike Faist in West Side Story<br />15:24 Nicole Kidman in Being the Ricardos<br />18:28 Penelope Cruz in Parallel Mothers<br />22:08 Gay Norway Post Office Commercial<br /><br />Subscribe to our channel! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/crookedmedia?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/crookedmedia?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it.
