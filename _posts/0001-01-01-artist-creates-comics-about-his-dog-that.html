The intense affection I felt for this creature I could not communicate with inspired me to imagine the conversations we would have if I could.<br /><br />Recently, I realized that the huge collection of stuff I had written might actually entertain other people. The problem was they were kind of boring to look at in text form. They needed to be brought to life to have the same energy and verve as my actual dog.<br /><br />Enter Hey Buddy Comics' talented artist “K”. Together, we planned out a series of comics based on my stories, the start of which you can see below.<br /><br />I hope you like them. There are many more to come! Find us on Instagram if you want to see them.<br /><br /> More info <br />✅ Instagram :<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/heybuddycomics/">https://www.instagram.com/heybuddycomics/</a><br /><br />✅ I do not own the image or the music in my video.
