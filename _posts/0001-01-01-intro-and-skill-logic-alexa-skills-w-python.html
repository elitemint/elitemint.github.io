{% raw %}Welcome to an Alexa Skills tutorial for Python programmers. In this tutorial, we're going to go through the making of a quick skill for an Alexa device.<br /><br />To follow along, you will need an Alexa enabled device, ngrok or an https enabled server, and an Amazon Developer Account. Do note, this account (the account you're using in the developer console) needs to be the same account that you paired your Alexa device with when setting it up.<br /><br />Got all of that? Great, on to the Python! We're going to use Flask-Ask, which is a Flask-extension that will make skill creation a bit easier.{% endraw %}
