{% raw %}Thanks to NBC’s American Auto for sponsoring today’s video. Check out the first two episodes of the all-new comedy here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pck-nbcapp.co/american-auto">https://pck-nbcapp.co/american-auto</a> and watch the premiere on NBC January 4 at 8/7c.<br /><br />Mickey Thompson shaped American motorsports more than any other figure, and he didn’t deserve to die. But he was murdered in cold blood in his driveway. You probably know Mickey from his tires, but there was much more to him than a name on a sidewall. He was a drag racer, a land speed record holder, an inventor, and so much more. Who killed Mickey Thompson, and why? Join host James Pumphrey for a deep dive into this racing icon, and a look at the mysterious murder that brought his life to a tragic end. <br /><br />Thanks to Mike Schafernak for the dope edit.
