{% raw %}Salamis, principal city of ancient Cyprus, located on the east coast of the island, north of modern Famagusta. According to the Homeric epics, Salamis was founded after the Trojan War by the archer Teucer, who came from the island of Salamis, off Attica. This literary tradition probably reflects the Sea Peoples’ occupation of Cyprus (c. 1193 BC), Teucer perhaps representing Tjekker of the Egyptian records. Later, the city grew because of its excellent harbour; it became the chief Cypriot outlet for trade with Phoenicia, Egypt, and Cilicia.<br /><br />Salamis came under Persian control in 525 BC. In 306 BC Demetrius I Poliorcetes of Macedonia won a great naval victory there over Ptolemy I of Egypt. Salamis was sacked in the Jewish revolt of AD 115–117 and suffered repeatedly from earthquakes; it was completely rebuilt by the Christian emperor Constantius II (reigned AD 337–361) and given the name Constantia. Under Christian rule, Salamis was the metropolitan see of Cyprus. Destroyed again by the Arabs under Muʿāwiyah (c. 648), the city was thereafter abandoned.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Salamis-ancient-city-Cyprus">https://www.britannica.com/place/Salamis-ancient-city-Cyprus</a><br /><br />If you've enjoyed watching this video, please don't forget to LIKE, leave your COMMENT below, SHARE, &amp; SUBSCRIBE and click the notification bell &quot;All&quot; so you will be updated with my next video upload.<br /><br />#SalamisRuins #SalamisNorthCyprus{% endraw %}
