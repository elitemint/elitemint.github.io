{% raw %}The Laidlaw's H-D crew takes a day trip on Adventure Touring Motorcycles into Joshua Tree Nation Park. 3 Pan Americas and 1 KTM 890 are the bikes of choice. Matt goes into details on the roads they took and how the Pan Americas performed. It was Nick's first time off-road and he explains his ride as he has a few &quot;learning experiences&quot; along the way. <br /><br />Like my Videos?
