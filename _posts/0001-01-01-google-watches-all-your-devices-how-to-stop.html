{% raw %}You may think you're protecting a computer with a VPN, Location turned off and various privacy strategies, but without awareness of all your devices, Google and other Big tech could be spying on all  your devices at once, validating information among them like IP addresses and locations.<br /><br /><br />Google is also running perpetual little programs that do telemetry for Google even while devices are not in use. Information mismatches between devices (because of VPN use for example) can be auto-corrected based on matching devices with historical records that cannot be erased.<br /><br /><br />There are many many tricks and we are not aware of them, you will think you have privacy but in reality you won't. You need to understand what's involved and your knowledge needs to be brought up a notch.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Check Out Startpage Search Engine<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.startpage.com/?segment=startpage.referral&amp;utm_source=rob.braxman">https://www.startpage.com/?segment=startpage.referral&amp;utm_source=rob.braxman</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />-----------------------------------<br /><br /><br />I'm the Internet Privacy Guy. I'm a public interest technologist. I'm here to educate. You are losing your Internet privacy and Internet security every day if you don't fight for it. Your data is collected with endless permanent data mining. Learn about a TOR router, a VPN , antivirus, spyware, firewalls, IP address, wifi triangulation, data privacy regulation, backups and tech tools, and evading mass surveillance from NSA, CIA, FBI. Learn how to be anonymous on the Internet so you are not profiled. Learn to speak freely with pseudo anonymity. Learn more about the dangers of the inernet and the dangers of social media, dangers of email.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I like alternative communication technology like Amateur Radio and data communications using Analog. I'm a licensed HAM operator.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Support this channel on Patreon! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=17858353">https://www.patreon.com/user?u=17858353</a><br /><br /><br />Contact Rob on the Brax.Me App (@robbraxman) for encrypted conversations (open source platform)<br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://brax.me/home/rob">https://brax.me/home/rob</a> Store for BytzVPN, BraxRouter, De-googled Privacy AOSP Phones, Linux phones, and merchandise<br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bytzvpn.com">https://bytzvpn.com</a> Premium VPN with Pi-Hole, Cloud-Based TOR Routing<br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whatthezuck.net">https://whatthezuck.net</a> Cybersecurity Reference<br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://brax.me">https://brax.me</a> Privacy Focused Social Media - Open Source <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Please follow me on Odysee!
