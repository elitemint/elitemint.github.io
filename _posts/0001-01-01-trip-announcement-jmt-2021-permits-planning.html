{% raw %}In this episode I show how to get an alternate JMT permits, how I've planned my trip, and constant struggles to get the base weight down.  <br /><br />We are Corey and Lori; we have been Backpacking together since 2017.  Living in the Pacific Northwest gives us great opportunities to get on the trail.  Our goal is to show our adventures to inspire others and learn from a great community of nature lovers.  If you have an opinion of what we could do better, or something that would enhance our outdoor experience, please share it with us!<br /><br />-----------------------------APPS MENTIONED-----------------------------<br />alltrails.com<br />Guthooks Guides @ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://atlasguides.com/trail-guides/">https://atlasguides.com/trail-guides/</a> <br /><br /><br />-----------------------------SOCIAL-----------------------------<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/story_also_rhymes/">https://www.instagram.com/story_also_rhymes/</a><br /><br />#jmt2021 #backpacking #storyalsorhmes{% endraw %}
