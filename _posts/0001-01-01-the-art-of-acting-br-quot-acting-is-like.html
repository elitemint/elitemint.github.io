{% raw %}***<br />&quot;Acting is like sculpture, it's what you take away from yourself to reveal the truth of what you're doing that makes a performance&quot; - Orson Welles<br /><br />I wanted to continue our cinema projects, now concentrating on &quot;acting&quot;. <br /><br />If any of your favourite actors (or movies) have not made it into this under 3 minute video, then I am sorry - what I have included here is scenes that have resonated with me over the years. Movies are provided in the video as TONS of you ask in the comments. Here's hoping this will clear up all the confusion. <br /><br />Wonderful monologues from the great Orson Welles and Elia Kazan.<br />__________________________________________________<br /><br /> Cinema Tribute<br /><br /><br />*Music: <br />Counting Stars by Brand X Music{% endraw %}
