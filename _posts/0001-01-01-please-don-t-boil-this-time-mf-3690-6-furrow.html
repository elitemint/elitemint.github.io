{% raw %}In today's video the wet weather finally breaks which means we can go back to ploughing and getting ready to sow winter crops. The MF 3690 is back on the wagon plough that we used on our vintage day and with a Father Phil quick fix we managed to get the ploughing finished this time without her boiling. Uncle Ian is ploughing with the 4-furrow and we get the field finished together. <br /><br />Hope you enjoy, any questions hit me down in the comments below, thanks for watching.
