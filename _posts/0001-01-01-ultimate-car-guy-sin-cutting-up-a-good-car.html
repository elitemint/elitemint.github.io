{% raw %}I don't even know how to start this video description.<br /><br />Everyone seems to be losing their minds on this 1956 sedan delivery.  &quot;save it&quot; &quot;cut up the nomad&quot; &quot;cut up the 4 door wagon&quot;.  I've never seen so much passion about a ratty old parts car.<br /><br />Just because it's rare doesn't mean it's valuable.  This sedan delivery sat on EBAY for anyone to buy for over a month.  No one scooped it up so I went in with a reasonable offer an took it home.<br /><br />Unfortunately the better the car the better it is as a parts car.  I'm not a fan of sedan deliveries and judging by how long it was up for sale, I'm not alone.<br /><br />It will live on and help build other cars.  1 car on the road is better than 2 cars in a field.{% endraw %}
