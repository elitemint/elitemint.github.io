{% raw %}Snoring in children is not at all normal, in fact an infant in the first  few  months of their  life  can have  some noisy breathing. However if your  child has been taken care  in a  neonatal ICU, what we call as  NICU after birth then any kind of  noisy breathing would be assessed. Here at our hospital, we  have all the expertise  to assess the  delicate ones on the out  patients  as well, so that tour child  does  not go through the general anaesthesia and interventions till the  diagnosis is  reached, we offer out patient  based flexible nasolayngoscopy, which  is  very  safe  and it is  done in a safe  environment. We have the expertise of taking care of these children if they require any surgical intervention. Lets keep in mind when these little ones are in the ICU or ventilated or intubated, the  rest of the breathing pipe  and breathing structure  may get  some collateral damage. So you  should  make  sure that if the children are having any kind of  noisy  breathing  or difficulty  in swallowing, it  should be  investigated by a  paediatric  ENT surgeon. Lets talk about snoring  in children. The commonest cause for snoring in children in enlarged tonsils and adenoids. Usually it will be an ENT  surgeon  who will be taking care of this. Adenoids are sitting  at the  back of the nose we do an outpatient based endoscopy  so that  we can show you  the  size of the  adenoids and  how  much it is  blocking your  child’ s  breathing, we  also  offer all the  techniques and the  latest  ways  of  operating these  adenoids and tonsils, which is called as  coblation. So once the patient  is  on our paediatric  ENT’s  hands, he will get the  best  of the  world  class treatment in our  hospital.{% endraw %}
