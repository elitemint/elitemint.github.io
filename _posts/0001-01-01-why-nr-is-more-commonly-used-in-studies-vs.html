{% raw %}The bulk of the research on NAD+ precursors has focused on nicotinamide riboside largely because it is inexpensive to produce. Nicotinamide mononucleotide, however, is a large, complex molecule that is difficult and, therefore, costly to produce. And, although these products are widely available on the common market in supplement form, Dr. Sinclair does not endorse them, preferring to focus his efforts on developing pharmaceutical-grade products. In this clip, Dr. David Sinclair discusses the economic issues associated with research using nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide.<br /><br />This clip was taken from the FoundMyFitness interview with Dr. David Sinclair found at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/5DtWqzalEnc">https://youtu.be/5DtWqzalEnc</a><br /><br />Original episode published on Nov 6, 2019{% endraw %}
