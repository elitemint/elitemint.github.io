{% raw %}Today's video is a sort out and look through all the coins I am adding to my collection from the past three months or so. A lot of the coins in the video will have appeared on the channel already, but not all of them. Anything we find that isn't needed for the books during hunts, goes into the keeper box, along with anything found in change or that friends have given me (these can't go into the book even if we need them!).<br /><br /><br /><br />Let's see what 50p coins and £2 coins worth keeping we have found recently, what's the rarest? Have we found many Olympic coins? Are Shakespeare £2s still worth keeping? <br /><br />Email me - LAFTACoins@hotmail.com<br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGYHBoTQnXy3CK2OhyDw5dQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGYHBoTQnXy3CK2OhyDw5dQ/join</a>{% endraw %}
