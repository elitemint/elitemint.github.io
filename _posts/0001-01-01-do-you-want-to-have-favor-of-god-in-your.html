{% raw %}Anything you do in the house of God turns out into blessings for you. God’s children ought to always have a strong desire to do the things of God. God’s people should always be ready to be involved in the works of service in the house of God. When you do things in the house of God you don’t need someone to say thank you because you have done it unto God. Serving God brings to you the opportunity for miracles. Serving God promotes you.
