I talk about how to start a business, how to start a startup, business plans by startups, do you need investment, what is a business plan, validating your ideas, spending time and effort on planning, self-funding your business, the journey to understanding the market and your customers, and how business plans are not about the economics of the market, but instead about YOU.  What every small business owner should know!<br /><br />There is a big difference between what you learn in business school, and what you need to know in the real world â€“ just ask any startup founder or business owner!  My goal is to focus on the real-world aspects of business, giving practical tips and tricks that are not usually covered in school.<br /><br />#startup<br />#howtostartabusiness<br />#startupideas<br /><br />(Please note:  I own the copyright to all music contained in this video, and can provide verification upon request.){% endraw %}
