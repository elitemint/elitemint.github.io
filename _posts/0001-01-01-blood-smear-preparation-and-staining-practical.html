RBCs are the most abundant blood cells. They impart a red colour to the blood.<br />In this experiment, we will be covering the procedure on how to prepare a thin blood smear and stain it with an appropriate stain for the morphological and quantitative study of the various cellular elements of blood.<br />For this experiment, we will need the following:<br />Blood sample <br />Glass slides<br />Leishman’s stain or Wright’s Blood stain or Giemsa’s stain<br />Distilled water<br />Droppers<br />Petridish or Coplin jar<br />Compound light microscope<br />Immersion oil<br />Cotton and rubbing alcohol<br />Blood lancet or a pricking device<br /><br />Take two glass slides and clean it with 90% alcohol <br />Disinfect a finger with alcohol and prick with a sterile lancet or a pricking device<br />Place a tiny droplet of the blood at the centre of one corner of one of the glass slides.<br />Using the second pre cleaned slide, touch the drop of blood while inclining the slide at a 45 degree angle.<br />Now gently and briskly move the inclined slide towards the other end of the slide containing the blood drop in order to obtain a smear.<br />A properly smeared blood appears roughly tongue shaped as seen here.<br />Allow the smear to air dry for a minute or so.<br />Place the slide in a petri dish with the blood smear facing up. <br />Add several drops of the Leishman’s stain to the blood smear and cover the petri dish.<br />Alternatively, you may fill a coplin jar with Leishman stain and immerse the slide in the stain.<br />Stain for 1 minute and then add twice the volume of distilled water to the stain.<br />Allow the water and the stain to properly mix and keep it aside for about 10minutes.<br />Drain the slide and wash with distilled water.<br />Proper staining results in a blood smear that is rose pink in colour.<br />Air dry the slide while keeping it in an inclined position.<br />The slide is now ready for observation under the microscope.<br />Observe and study the various blood cells under 40x and 100x objective.<br />For 100x , place a drop of immersion oil on the slide, gently lower the 100 x objective until it touches the oil surface. Hereon, use the fine adjustment knob for focussing.{% endraw %}
