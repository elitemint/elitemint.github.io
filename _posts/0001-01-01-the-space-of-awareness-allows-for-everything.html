{% raw %}&quot;The Space of Awareness Allows for Everything&quot; satsang recorded on a meditation retreat with Craig Holliday. <br /><br />In this satsang, Craig speaks about the spiritual freedom that is available to us as we step into awareness and step away from our egoic nature. As we open in this direction, we open to that which is holy, Divine and eternally free.  <br /><br />Craig is a gifted Meditation and Spiritual Teacher trained in both the Yogic and Buddhist traditions and Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC).  His teachers have included Adyashanti, A. H. Almaas, Gangaji, Caroline Myss, Matt Kahn, Lama Tsultrim, and Eckhart Tolle with Christ, Sri Aurobindo and the Buddha as his major influences.  Craig began teaching after a series of profound awakenings with his teacher Adyashanti.<br /><br />Craig offers Skype sessions, retreats and workshops and meets with individuals from around the world who have a sincere desire to awaken out of our painful egoic existence and into this Beauty that we always already are. He offers  mindfulness-based therapy,  nondual therapy, meditation, yoga, kundalini support therapy, chakra instruction, and help for opening and healing the heart through surrendering oneself to the movement of Divine Intelligence.
