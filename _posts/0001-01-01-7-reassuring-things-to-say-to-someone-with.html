{% raw %}Is someone you care about suffering from anxiety or an anxiety disorder? Are you concerned about their mental health recently? Do you find yourself at a loss over how to react when the topic does come up? There are many ways to be supportive without overstepping boundaries or taking on more than you can handle. It's important to help you understand from a psychology-oriented perspective, the thoughts and emotions behind anxiety so you can be well equipped to be supportive. <br /><br />Disclaimer: This is meant as a self-improvement guide and should not be used as self-treatment. If you or someone you know is struggling with anxiety or any mental health issues, be sure to seek help. Even though having a supportive environment does help but professional help and advice can go a long way.<br /><br />We also made a video on the things to say to someone with depression: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/sn8UME5kik4">https://youtu.be/sn8UME5kik4</a> <br /><br />Writer: Gabrielle LaFrank <br />Script Editor: Rida Batool <br />Script Manager: Kelly Soong <br />VO: Amanda Silvera <br />Animator: Phoebe Lewis (New Animator)<br />YouTube Manager: Cindy Cheong <br /><br />References: <br />Princing, M.
