Jeremy Lynch balanced a football on his head and on the back of his neck, before circling it round his neck. He then performed some kick-ups, before balancing the ball on his forehead. He then finished his performance with some kick-ups whilst laid down.<br /><br />In the semi-finals, Jeremy Lynch performed to 'A Little Less Conversation' by Elvis Presley. He began by dacing around the ball, however it began to roll of the stage. He recovered the ball, and began to perform some skilled kick-ups. He lost the ball again, causing Simon Cowell and Piers Morgan to press their buzzers, however the act continued. Jeremy spun round the stage with the ball trapped at his feet, and then finished the performance with some more kick-ups laid down.<br /><br />#JeremyLynch #tiktok #FUNNY<br />=====================================<br /><br />TIKTOK compilations every day!
