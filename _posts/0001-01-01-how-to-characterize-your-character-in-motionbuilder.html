{% raw %}In this video you'll learn the 4 steps you’ll need to characterize your character in MotionBuilder successfully:<br /> 1. T-Posing – The most import part of the process, requiring accurate alignment of the character’s joints.<br /> 2. Character Mapping – Completing the “Mapping List” describes the character hierarchy so MotionBuilder can understand it.<br /> 3. Characterize – The easy bit! Once the Characterize box is ticked, MotionBuilder will recognises your character as a MotionBuilder character.<br /> 4. Creating a Skeleton Definition File - Lets you skip step 2 when your characters have the same joint names.<br /><br />The success of any mocap project in MotionBuilder depends on how well you Characerize your character.<br /><br />Every time you use a character in MotionBuilder it relies on the characterization in some way: remapping mocap with Actor and Character assets, animating with the Control Rig and Poses, simulations with Rag-doll.<br /><br />Get it wrong and you'll not only impact the quality of your mocap data, but you'll also find yourself spending more time fixing problems than you do animating.{% endraw %}
