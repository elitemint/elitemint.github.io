{% raw %}Ruth Wacuka spent part of her childhood in an orphanage. During her time there, she says she got her hopes up and became attached to volunteers, but then was sorely disappointed when they left. She explains why she is asking people who want to volunteer in an orphanage to reconsider and to put their energies into programs that strengthen families instead.{% endraw %}
