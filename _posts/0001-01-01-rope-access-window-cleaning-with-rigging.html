{% raw %}Another big building, about 35 stories. I find making a load share this way is much faster than building Y hangs and it equalizes nicely. I'm also finally using a Sorbo channel now and I don't know how I ever cleaned windows before without one! Never going back! The clips are pretty annoying though. The main reason I liked the Ninja is easy rubber changes. I don't think I would risk changing the rubber in a Sorbo while on a drop. <br /><br />By the way for you people as OCD as me, the only reason I threw out so much rope is that it was landing on a sub-roof and I was using long ropes so we just picked mine to make sure we got down all the way. As anyone that works rope access knows you don't want to find out its not long enough once you're at the bottom. I also know the owner of the bike I put my bucket in, it wasn't just some random bike that got stuck in the exclusion zone :P Also my God I would NEVER drop the ropes the way I did after tie the butterfly! Talk about shock loading! That was soo soo stupid! I don't know why nobody has commented on it yet lol. <br /><br />*History fact- This hotel is built where the famous Alberta Boot Company store was located from 1978 - 2008. I can't even imagine how many cowboy boots must have been made in those 30 years! The company still exists so if you're in the market for a pair of cowboy boots they're highly recommended <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.albertaboot.com">http://www.albertaboot.com</a><br /><br />Royalty free music thanks to DJ Ferruh Berk AdalıoğluPro  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/dj-fba">https://soundcloud.com/dj-fba</a><br /><br />#ropeaccess#rigging#windowcleaning{% endraw %}
