Featuring two tracks ‘Conjure Dreams’ and ‘Conjure Floyd’, both are peak time monsters that introduce two very different elements. ‘Conjure Dreams’ utilises a groovy, melodic bass that is reinforced using tight thumping drums to shatter any dance floor into the universe. ‘Conjure Floyd’ builds into a more ‘heads down’ techno vibe with a very interesting breakdown. Two sure fire tracks to ignite the floor.<br />Maceo Plex - Conjure Dreams - Drumcode - DC136, 2014-12-15<br /><br />More Drumcode releases: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/DrumcodePlaylist">http://bit.ly/DrumcodePlaylist</a><br /><br />#MaceoPlex #Techno<br /><br />Follow Drumcode:<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drumcode.se">https://drumcode.se</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/drumcoderecords">https://www.facebook.com/drumcoderecords</a><br />Soundcloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/drumcoderadio">https://soundcloud.com/drumcoderadio</a>{% endraw %}
