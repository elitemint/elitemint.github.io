{% raw %}<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ficepgroup.com/steel-construction-machinery/angles/">https://www.ficepgroup.com/steel-construction-machinery/angles/</a><br /><br />The structural steel fabrication process of miscellaneous shapes has reached a new level of capability with the FICEP Tipo D 50.  This extremely versatile system for miscellaneous shapes addresses holes and cut off not just in angles, flats and channels but also structural tubes and small I-beams.  Programmable miter cuts are possible in both directions in these diverse structural steel shapes.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Tipo D 50 incorporates two high performance “Direct Drive” drill spindles that can accept up to six different tools automatically with an integrated tool changer.  Each spindle features a secondary sub axis for spindle positioning in the length axis.  This sub-axis capability permits holes to be drilled in each surface  simultaneously even if they are not in the same alignment.  Typical hole patterns can be drilled without the need to unclamp and re-clamp the material for each spindle operation to reduce the cycle times drastically.  This unique sub-axis capability affords the ability to perform milling operations such as the generation on large holes and slots. <br /><br />Miscellaneous structural steel shapes up to 300 mm or 12” can be processed on the Tipo D 50.<br /><br />Several unique innovative features have been incorporated into this unique product give it the ability to go from a stock length angle to a finished part automatically and without the need to handle material from one operation to the next. <br /><br />A positive rack and pinion material positioning system generates industry leading accuracy and speed.  The carriage positioning system enables full automation including automatic stock length loading, measuring, discharge of finished parts and the removal of the scrap or drops while maximizing material utilization.  This unique level of automation permits one attendant to monitor the production of several lines.<br /><br />Additional capabilities such as part marking can be integrated into the line.  Marking can be achieved with either a system of index able cartridges each containing multiple characters or a fully programmable marking press.<br /><br />Cutting to length can be accomplished with  a circular saw using carbide inserts for unbelievable productivity and finish.{% endraw %}
