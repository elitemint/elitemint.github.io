If you have any old 1970s videotapes recorded off of TV please email: tapes@fuzzy.tv  Even though (mostly) short clips are displayed here, we preserve the entire broadcasts in our archives - the complete programs with breaks (or however much is present on the tape), for historical preservation. For information on how to help in our mission, to donate or lend tapes to be converted to DVD, please e-mail tapes@fuzzy.tv  Thank you for your help!{% endraw %}
