On the other hand, advertisers can deliver targeted ads to maximize engagement and cut down losses due to ad fraud and abuse.<br /><br />The Basic Attention Token itself is the unit of reward in this advertising ecosystem, and is exchanged between advertisers, publishers and users. Advertisers pay for their advertising campaigns in BAT tokens. Out of this budget, a small portion is distributed to advertisers, while 70% is distributed to users â€” whereas the intermediaries that typically drive up advertising costs are cut out of the equation to improve cost-efficiency.<br /><br />#Crypto #Altcoin #BAT{% endraw %}
