Click here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/CarPartscom3">https://bit.ly/CarPartscom3</a> to check out their massive inventory of car parts.<br /><br />Paul Walker didn’t just play a laid back SoCal car guy in The Fast And The Furious movies, he was a laid back SoCal car guy IRL. The role of Brian O’Conner fit him like a glove, so it’s no wonder it became the defining role of his career. But there was more to Paul Walker than fast cars, explosive action, and cheesy lines—a lot more. Join host James Pumphrey as he gets you Up To Speed on the late, great Paul Walker! <br /><br />For more info on Paul Walker's disaster relief non-profit, Reach Out Worldwide, click here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://roww.org/">https://roww.org/</a> <br /> <br />Shoutout to the Rybox 360-420 himself, Ryan Hailey for the edit.
