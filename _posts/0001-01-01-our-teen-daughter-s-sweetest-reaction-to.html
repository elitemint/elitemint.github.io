{% raw %}Our teenager is driving! Can't even believe we have another teen driver in the house! Keira has been working so hard for months on studying to get her driver's permit while she is learning to drive so she can get her license when she turns 16, and today she passed her test so she is now road legal! She seriously had the cutest reaction to the instructor giving her her test results and we are definitely keeping this video footage to play on her wedding day. ðŸ˜‚ And the day was definitely a roller coaster because as soon as we dropped her off at school, we had to take Lincoln to his neurologist to run an EEG and MRI on his brain to really get to the bottom of his seizures and make sure we are on the right plan of action moving forward. It was a quite an emotional day to say the least. <br /><br />OUR OTHER CHANNELS<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/AmandaMillerOfficial">http://www.youtube.com/AmandaMillerOfficial</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/StephenMillerMusic">http://www.youtube.com/StephenMillerMusic</a><br /><br />Go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.compassion.com/themillerfam">http://www.compassion.com/themillerfam</a> to sponsor a child today! 9,500 children in Ethiopia are waiting to be sponsored!
