{% raw %}MANIFEST with Purpose - Manifest While You Sleep Meditation<br /><br />Intro: 0:00 - 4:27<br />Guided Meditation: 4:28 - 20:33<br />Positive Affirmations: 20:33 - 3:00:00<br /><br />In the last meditation, I spoke about how we all have this incredible ability to find exactly what we are seeking. Seek and you shall find.  But then I started thinking. What if we don’t know what we are supposed to be seeking? How are we supposed to FIND anything if we don’t know WHAT it is we are supposed to be looking for, if we don’t know what we truly WANT and DESIRE in life? For some of us, our biggest issue is figuring out what it is we are even looking for. Well, that brings me to another incredible gift we all have inside us.<br />We are all guided day to day by this subtle voice inside us. What is it telling us? Where is it guiding us to? It is guiding us to our highest purpose in life. It is guided us to a life filled with meaning. But how do we listen to this voice? How do we know what we are supposed to be listening to? I know you may be thinking, I don’t care about purpose or meaning, I just want money, or I just want a relationship in my life and I will be happy and all my problems will be solved. Well all you have to do ask the majority of lottery winners who end up more miserable, and less fulfilled merely a year after winning. Money wont provide you happiness and neither will a relationship, but don’t worry. I know this sounds bad, but trust me, Just keep listening, it gets better. <br />The truth is, your potential in life manifests itself in your present life, moment to moment, by making you INTERESTED in specific things. The things you are interested in will lead you on a path to maximal development. We are all set up in a way so that we are automatically interested in those things that will fully expand us as human beings. The things we are interested in will guide us to our full potential. <br />Now, Sometimes the beauty of life is so subtle, that it is easy for us to miss it. This truth about all of us is so significant that it is not only difficult to explain, but difficult to comprehend how incredible it really is. <br />So for you to figure out what you want, you must look at what you are interested in day to day. It will not only determine what you want, it will guide you on a path of meaning and purpose, allowing you to manifest your full potential. Again, I know, you want money, health, great relationships, you might not give two cares about finding meaning and purpose. <br />But here’s the kicker.. when you begin to manifest things you want in your life, you won’t just be manifesting what you ask for, it will take you on an incredible journey that will fill your life with meaning and purpose. Your interests in life not only guide you to what you want, it guides you to fulfilling your purpose in life. You will not only have what you want, but your life will be fulfilled. If it’s money you want, you will manifest in a way that brings your life meaning. If it’s love you are seeking, you will manifest it in a way that brings your life purpose and fulfillment. <br />So, in this meditation, you will create an intention to become aware of what you are interested in, in your waking life. As you sink deep into the subconscious mind, your interests will come to light, guiding you in not only figuring out what you want, but also in manifesting that which you desire. As you come back to this meditation nightly, your interests will become more apparent, and your desires will become more obvious. You will begin to manifest not only what you want, but you will manifest it in a manner that brings your life meaning and purpose. Happiness and fulfillment.{% endraw %}
