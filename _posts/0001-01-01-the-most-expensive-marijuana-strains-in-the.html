{% raw %}Port City Alternative - Stockton's Premiere Marijuana Dispensary - www.PortCityAlternative.com<br /><br />Cannabis strains are either pure or hybrid varieties of the plant genus Cannabis, which encompasses the species C. sativa, C. indica and C. ruderalis.<br /><br />Varieties are developed to intensify specific characteristics of the plant, or to differentiate the strain for the purposes of marketing or to make it more effective as a drug. Variety names are typically chosen by their growers, and often reflect properties of the plant such as taste, color, smell, or the origin of the variety.[citation needed] Cannabis strains commonly refer to those varieties with recreational and medicinal use. These varieties have been cultivated to contain a high percentage of cannabinoids. Several varieties of Cannabis, known as hemp, have a very low cannabinoid content, and are instead grown for their fiber and seed.<br /><br />Check out some of these Cannabis Strains - enjoy!<br /><br />Port City Alternative<br />Stockton's Premiere Marijuana Dispensary<br />www.PortCityAlternative.com{% endraw %}
