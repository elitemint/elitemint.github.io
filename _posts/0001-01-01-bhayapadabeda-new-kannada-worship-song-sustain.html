{% raw %}#bhayapadabeda #sustainmusic #praveenpaul #kannadaworshipsong #kannadaworshipsong2021 #kannadaworship<br /><br />This song BHAYAPADABEDA birthed out of my quiet time when i was going through the lowest point and was living in the fear of the unknown.<br />&quot;Fear not&quot; is the most repeated command in the bible. <br />Fear is the enemies most popular weapons used against God's children.<br />I was a victim of fear but God spoke to me through Isaiah 41.10 ..we might feel afraid but we have a God who is with us.<br />We might not be in control of our circumstances but can trust and put our faith in the one who can.<br />As the culture around us seems saturated and plunged into state of fear by the pandemic<br />Im hoping this song will encourage and remind you everyday to choose faith over fear and trust that there is a higher power at work than depression, poverty, setbacks sickness, death and God will help us in every step to conquer fear.<br />May you be ministered as you hear this song.<br /><br />LYRICS :<br /><br />Verse:<br />Bhayapadabeda nan aathmave<br />Yesu iruva ninondhige <br />Ninna kaneeranu oresuvanu <br />Kaiyannu ididhu nadesuvanu <br /><br />Chorus:<br />Nanna devaru jeeva swaroopanu<br />Maranadha kondiya muridhathanu<br />Aakasha bhumiyu nashisodharu <br />Athan preethi endhigu shaashvathavu <br /><br />Bridge:<br />Manase chinthisabeda <br />Hrydayave kalavalabeda <br />Athmane Bhayapadabeda <br />Nan yesu jothe iruva<br /><br />©️ Sustain Music<br /><br />Lyrics, Composition &amp; Vocals | Praveen Paul<br />Direction | Flemin Louies<br />Cast | Shubael |Shane<br />Guitars | Joel Sakkari<br />Production Crew<br />Abhishek Paul, Siddharth Shamala<br /><br />Video Production &amp; Post | Ugama Media<br />Cinematography &amp; Coloring | Nireekshith<br />Editing | Priya Shankar<br />Camera Asst. | Prajwal Md, Gaffer Santosh<br />Recording, Mixing &amp; Mastering | Zubin Paul<br />Ugama Media, Mysuru<br />Www.Ugama.Co.In<br /><br />Special Thanks : Ps.
