{% raw %}There are alot of things that we dont take away on missions like this as we like to keep things basic and lightweight BUT a BARRAMUNDI on the menu out in the wilderness is worth its weight in gold. On day 2 of our mission down deep into Gulf Country, Cape York AUSTRALIA, we return back to our tree camp from fishing to find 2 Catamarans in the river mouth. We stop and say Gday and then whilst cooking BEER BATTERED BARRA for lunch we set ourselves the challenge of catching them both a Barramundi for dinner. The owners Chris and Terry turn out to be really nice people on an amazing adventure and we share some stories while the suns setting on the bow. These experiences are what make what we do so special and create memories that will be with us forever.<br />Shout out to Chris and Terry, Thanks for the trade!<br />Shout out to all of you, thanks for all your ongoing support and for all the messages over Christmas.<br /><br />Link to the Crocodile attack story.: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=R1lHhI0OMks">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=R1lHhI0OMks</a><br /><br /><br />If you want to join our exclusive community with monthly giveaways and live video calls check out www.patreon.com/wildreaches<br /><br />AND if you are after merch www.wildreaches.com/shop{% endraw %}
