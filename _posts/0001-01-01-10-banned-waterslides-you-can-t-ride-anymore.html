I mean, people in Argentina and Australia are probably getting ready for some heat. But here in the north, the weather is starting to get a bit colder...kinda. Anyway, what’s a good thing to do in the summer? Visit a waterpark! Of course. It’s a great way to get your dose of sun and fun in the water before the weather gets too cold. Today, it seems like there are waterparks all around the world. Some places are lucky enough to have them open all year-round, and some others have to wait until the summer months to enjoy them. But even though waterparks can be a lot of fun, they can also be scenarios of deadly moments, especially when they have some sketchy waterslides that no one should be riding. In today’s video, we’ll be looking at “10 Banned Waterslides You Can’t Ride Anymore!” - It might be exciting to watch some of these thrilling rides, but you’ll definitely be happy that you were not the last person to ride them! Let’s check them out.<br /><br />The Steamer Slide<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mt8jaM0gJw4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mt8jaM0gJw4</a><br /><br />I don’t know about you, but when I think of Canada, I think of some of the nicest people in the world, and one of the safest and most comfortable countries that anyone could live in. That’s why it was a bit of a surprise to know that they’re home to the Calypso Waterpark, a place that had to shut down one of its most popular waterslides: the one called The Steamer. The Steamer was like your regular waterpark attraction. It allowed one or two people to ride down a slide while being on an inner tube. But once inside, things could get quite chaotic. The ride could reach high speeds, crazy enough to flip people off their tubes. And even though flipping out of a tube is usually not a big deal, it kinda became a big deal when multiple riders began to report injured backs, fractured skulls, and plenty of other injuries that resulted in 20 safety violations. In the end, the park decided to shut down the ride, but before they could do that, they had to pay a fine of 280,000 dollars. <br /><br />Aquasphere <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNcWFEL2LL4&amp;t=6s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNcWFEL2LL4&amp;t=6s</a><br /><br />Don’t let the looks of it fool you! The Aquasphere probably looked like an easy ride, but I’m not sure you would have enjoyed riding it. In fact, many adults out there decided it was not a good idea to let the children go on it. The Aquasphere started with a nice ride on a floating raft. It all seemed nice and peaceful until you made it to the actual spheres! While this was a thrilling and exciting moment for many people, it also became a nightmare for others. Due to its many twists and turns, the Aquasphere ended up injuring many unlucky riders, which caused the authorities at the Peninsula Aquatic Recreation Center to shut it down on multiple occasions. In the end, they decided to demolish it completely and build a new one to address all the safety concerns. And I guess that was the best decision. After all, a waterslide that left some people unconscious is probably not the type of experience that waterpark guests are looking for.<br /><br /><br />The Black Hole Water Slide<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j74fDKUhik4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j74fDKUhik4</a><br /><br />Have you ever wondered what is like to be sucked into a black hole in outer space? Well, maybe this waterslide can give us an idea. When people went in it, they couldn’t see anything, except for some neon lights, which made the whole experience awesome...except for those who got hurt. Multiple people got injured while on this ride, but one of the worst cases was that of a man who claims to have been struck by something in the dark. After the incident, he wasn’t able to move his legs and it was hard for him to get out of the ride. On top of that, he had to get a titanium plate inserted into his neck, but on the bright side, the whole incident got him 1.73 million dollars from a lawsuit that he won against the waterpark. Today, The Black Hole Water Slide doesn’t exist anymore. But I’m not sure is entirely due to these awful incidents. Instead, Universal opened a new waterpark across from the Wet N’ Wild Waterpark (which is where the Black Hole was at). For that reason, people don’t get to enjoy this crazy ride anymore. I just hope the new park doesn’t have anything as crazy and deadly as this ride. <br /><br />Sahara Sandwinders <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wiscnews.com/baraboonewsrepublic/news/local/family-sues-resort-for-water-slide-injury/article_a340154d-1944-5d10-8f62-537449f02a8d.html">https://www.wiscnews.com/baraboonewsrepublic/news/local/family-sues-resort-for-water-slide-injury/article_a340154d-1944-5d10-8f62-537449f02a8d.html</a>{% endraw %}
