{% raw %}A totally new design, Smith and Wesson brings us the surprising CSX. Maybe you can think of it as a combination of Sig P938 and a Shield Plus. Continuing an industry trend, this pistol has a few more ounces than the striker fired concealed carry kings like the Sig P365 and S.A. Hellcat but it's still light at 20 oz. That and a single action only (SAO) trigger will make the CSX easier to hit with.  It's an interesting and new concealed carry pistol formula. It does have some quirks and these are addressed in this feature length Nutnfancy gun review.  Snow testing was accomplished. Accuracy, reliability, firepower, sights, finishing, ergos, and shootability are shown/discussed. A rare appearance of Mrs Nutnfancy helping with the shooting is part of this timely, feature length TNP GRV!<br /><br />TNP is now focused in Patreon, this is where the full blown TNP content is found:<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Nutnfancy">https://www.patreon.com/Nutnfancy</a><br />You can now donate to TNP via PayPal if you'd prefer that method, humble gratitude from us for that support: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/y5zzf9tq">https://tinyurl.com/y5zzf9tq</a><br /><br />Kusiak Leather's awesome holsters, highly rec'd: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/y36haop3">https://tinyurl.com/y36haop3</a><br />Kusiak Leather Signature (super thin, super awesome, used by Nutnfancy):  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/y6phoxe2">https://tinyurl.com/y6phoxe2</a><br />Kusiak American IWB:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/y5klyg2n">https://tinyurl.com/y5klyg2n</a><br />Momentum Atlas 44, so excellent!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shrsl.com/292zr">https://shrsl.com/292zr</a><br />WE Banter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shrsl.com/343z8">https://shrsl.com/343z8</a><br />WE Banter TNP blue: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shrsl.com/343zb">https://shrsl.com/343zb</a><br />Spyderco Bow River, xlnt:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://shrsl.com/1yxkf">http://shrsl.com/1yxkf</a><br />Kizer Azo Vanguard Begleiter  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shrsl.com/2tsy2">https://shrsl.com/2tsy2</a><br />Civivi Elementum selection: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shrsl.com/2cpim">https://shrsl.com/2cpim</a>  <br />AKC F16 OTF  uto knife: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://shrsl.com/1y7yp">http://shrsl.com/1y7yp</a>   <br />AKC ACE Xtreme:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://shrsl.com/1y7ys">http://shrsl.com/1y7ys</a> <br />Olight compact weapon lights: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shrsl.com/3bpwr">https://shrsl.com/3bpwr</a><br /><br />TNP stuff at:  www.nutnfancy.bigcartel.com<br />Subscribe to TNP for more videos like this<br />Nutnfancy   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/jaf8tz4">http://tinyurl.com/jaf8tz4</a><br />TheNutnfancyProject  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/jg5cz6r">http://tinyurl.com/jg5cz6r</a><br />Sub to Nutnfancy Twitter feed:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/nutnfancy">https://twitter.com/nutnfancy</a><br /><br />Thanks to Gunnies Sporting Goods in Orem, UT ph (801) 226-7080 for the items sometimes provided to TNP for review.
