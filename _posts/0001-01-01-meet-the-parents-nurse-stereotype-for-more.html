When he states that he is in the Nursing field, the doctors in the room appear to be disappointed.<br /><br />This clip can be used to teach about gender stereotypes. Nursing jobs have traditionally been held by females, and the nursing profession has been viewed as lower caliber than that of a doctor. Given this view and Greg's gender, the doctors in Pam's family laugh when he tells them that he is a nurse. When Greg seriously indicates that he is a nurse, they are disappointed, as indicated by their silence and their facial expressions.<br /><br />This clip further illustrates gender stereotypes through the questioning of Greg by Pam's family. Their asking why he didn't pursue an M.D. and become a doctor suggests that they have certain expectations of him and could not initially believe that he preferred to pursue nursing.<br /><br />Have you used this clip in one of your classes?
