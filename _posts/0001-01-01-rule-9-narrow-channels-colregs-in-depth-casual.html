Contact details in the “About” page.<br /><br /><br />----------ABOUT THE VIDEO----------<br /><br />This video was originally uploaded to our other channel, Casual Navigation, back in 2018.<br /><br />An &quot;in depth&quot; look at Rule 9 of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, the COLREGS. The COLREGS are the rules of the road that vessels must obey at sea to avoid collisions.<br /><br />Rule 9 covers &quot;Narrow Channels&quot;. In this video I go into detail about the rule and give examples of how to apply the rule at sea.<br /><br />----------RULE 9----------<br /><br />Rule 9: Narrow channels<br /><br />(a) A vessel proceeding along the course of a narrow channel or fairway shall keep as near to the outer limit of the channel or fairway which lies on her starboard side as is safe and practicable.<br /><br />(b) A vessel of less than 20 metres in length or a sailing vessel shall not impede the passage of a vessel which can safely navigate only within a narrow channel or fairway.<br /><br />(c) A vessel engaged in fishing shall not impede the passage of any other vessel navigating within a narrow channel or fairway.<br /><br />(d) A vessel shall not cross a narrow channel or fairway if such crossing impedes the passage of a vessel which can safely navigate only within such channel or fairway. The latter vessel may use the sound signal prescribed in Rule 34(d) if in doubt as to the intention of the crossing vessel.<br /><br />(e) <br />i. In a narrow channel or fairway when overtaking can take place only if the vessel to be overtaken has to take action to permit safe passing, the vessel intending to overtake shall indicate her intention by sounding the appropriate signal prescribed in Rule 34(c)(i). The vessel to be overtaken shall, if in agreement, sound the appropriate signal prescribed in Rule 34(c)(ii) and take steps to permit safe passing. If in doubt she may sound the signals prescribed in Rule 34(d).<br /><br />ii. This Rule does not relieve the overtaking vessel of her obligation under Rule 13.<br /><br />(f) A vessel nearing a bend or an area of a narrow channel or fairway where other vessels may be obscured by an intervening obstruction shall navigate with particular alertness and caution and shall sound the appropriate signal prescribed in Rule 34(e).<br /><br />(g) Any vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid anchoring in a narrow channel.<br /><br /><br />----------DISCLAIMER----------<br /><br />Although we take all reasonable care to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information provided in the content on this channel, the content is provided “as is”.
