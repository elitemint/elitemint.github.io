{% raw %}Exploring the world of Forza Horizon 5 through all seasons and weather conditions. <br />Huge thanks to Forza for giving me access to the game early! Been slowly gathering footage for this over the last weeks but struggled with deciding when to stop, there is so much to explore, so much weather and time of day combinations, the same location can look so much different a few minutes later and change looks completely another few minutes later.  There was so much more I wanted to capture, but I'm already 2 weeks late, so this is where we stop.<br />And it was a bit too late when I noticed that some footage came out with some stutters, even tho I had no issues running the game maxed out, no clue what was causing it. There can be a laggy recording, a smooth one, and another laggy recording in a row while doing it all in the same location with the same weather conditions in a matter of 3 minutes.<br /><br />STICKERS / SCREENSHOTS <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.crownedstore.com/">https://www.crownedstore.com/</a> <br />SUPPORT WITH PATREON <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/CROWNED">https://www.patreon.com/CROWNED</a><br />ALL LINKS <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.crownedstore.com/contacts">https://www.crownedstore.com/contacts</a><br /><br />Outro song <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/6frhh-lUEUk">https://youtu.be/6frhh-lUEUk</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/azaleh/arcanum?si=0809233e5a2b4429b804994165516212">https://soundcloud.com/azaleh/arcanum?si=0809233e5a2b4429b804994165516212</a>{% endraw %}
