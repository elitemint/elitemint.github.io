{% raw %}Dave Rubin of The Rubin Report talks to Lauren Chen, Allison Williams, and Stu Burguiere from BlazeTV’s Stu Saves America about courts trying to stop the employer vaccine mandate, the insane push of kid's vaccine mandates, and the mainstream media trying to get a mistrial in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial. First, the Biden administration has been ordered by the courts to halt it’s employer COVID vaccine mandate. Despite this, Biden is telling large employers to proceed to demand proof of vaccination from it’s employees anyway. The targeting of the unvaccinated is only becoming worse. Allison Williams shares her story of how she was forced to leave ESPN due to their vaccine mandate. If the courts cannot stop medical tyranny, what will? Meanwhile, the push for school vaccine mandates is only beginning. Chicago’s Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady caught parents and reporters off guard by saying that indoor mask mandates in school might not end until the vaccination rate reaches 100%. As the prosecution’s case against Kyle Rittenhouse continues to fall apart, the media is getting desperate and pushing for a mistrial. They are currently targeting Judge Bruce Schroeder for the absurd reason of his phone having “God Bless the USA” for his ringtone.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />Watch The Rubin Report on BlazeTV:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.blazetv.com/series/8oHZJGqX8aaN-the-rubin-report">https://www.blazetv.com/series/8oHZJGqX8aaN-the-rubin-report</a><br /><br />----------<br /><br />The Rubin Report Roundtable is a place where you can hear sane discussions on controversial topics.
