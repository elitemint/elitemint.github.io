{% raw %}COURSE OF ACTION are one of the latest sensations on the Belgian Scene. Just like their good friends in Broken Promises they hail from the french-speaking part of Belgium and have shocked crowds all over the European Continent with their insanely emotional live shows, where bandmembers switch instruments and go into full-on emo style attack by attacking the floors and halls they play in.COA often get compared to bands like CONVERGE or MORNING AGAIN on an emotion and intensity level, but I would say they come closest to an AFTERSHOCK live show !!!!COURSE OF ACTION appear as special guests on the new BROKEN PROMISES album and have now recorded their second full length CD at DE STUDIO and MIDAS studios. COA went on a hiatus at the end of 2001/beginning 2002.<br /><br />Pistas<br />1 As We Witness Your Indifference <br />2 Ocean Of Despair <br />3 The Prophet Of Doom <br />4 Existence <br />5 Oasis Of Disillusion <br />6 Innocence <br />7 Suffocate <br />8 Forever There{% endraw %}
