{% raw %}Here is Swallowtail Jig!  This was one of the first tunes I ever learned, and it means a lot to me!  I've tried to make this video three times now, and each time I didn't like how it turned out.  I think this version worked out the best out of all of my attempts, so I hope you like it!  <br /><br />Whenever I end up at a new Celtic jam session, and people want me to start playing something, I usually pick this tune!  It seems like it's one that everyone knows, at least around where I live!<br /><br />I've been so rushed with work and everything has been so crazy this past week.  I hope things settle down a bit so I can relax~!  <br /><br />Thank you for watching!  If you liked this video, please subscribe for more violin videos every Tuesday!<br /><br />~Katy<br />-------------------<br />Software and equipment used:<br /><br />Software used (for Macintosh):<br />Garageband for attempted sound mixing<br />Final Cut Pro X for video editing<br /><br />Plugins for sound effects (I have A LOT to learn in this department!):<br />East West plugins â€“ Goliath Virtual Instrument (literally the best one, in my opinion), Stormdrum II<br /><br />Camera:<br />Canon 70D{% endraw %}
