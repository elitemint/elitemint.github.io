This is my truth. And as painful as that was to say, it was also liberating, because I took the whisper that was haunting me and taunting me throughout my life and finally gave it a voice.” [5:57]<br /> <br />“I had my own poison that my insecurities were constantly pumping into my veins that fear was constantly pumping into my veins. And I realized that as long as I was poisoned, I could only attract poison.” [8:16]<br /> <br />“fall more in love with you than you do with the potential outcome that you're achieving or looking to achieve.” [10:47]<br /> <br />“I realized that just because a thought comes my way doesn't mean I have to accept it. To accept the thought is to say, I'm going to allow this to now become a part of my truth.” [15:06]<br /> <br />“We're not qualified to be in a relationship until we realize what I need a person in my life for” [18:08]<br /> <br />“at the end of the day, it's love that leads us out of places of fear.” [25:03]<br /> <br />When we know that I am betraying myself to be in relationship with someone, then I have to ask myself, what am I receiving to them that is so valuable, that I am willing to betray myself?” [25:22]<br /> <br />“I spend so much mental real estate thinking about what I want to go wrong with someone that I don't have time to consider what I want to go well with my own spirit and soul.” [31:09]<br /> <br />“Not every person in your family can feed you. Not every person in your family can help you promote growth, and to create an environment for you to incubate hope. Some people are blowing your candle out while you're trying to get the flame going.” [38:23]<br /> <br />“The truth is, I'm afraid, but I'm going to dare to believe anyway. The truth is, I'm not qualified, but I'm gonna dare to go after it anyway.” [41:41]<br /> <br />More About Sarah: In 2017, Sarah launched Woman Evolve a ministry that focuses on incubating every woman to her fullness.
