Many petroglyphs and pictographs line the cliff walls, some dating back over 2000 years. Millenia old dinosaur tracks have been found fossilized in the ancient bedrock, and then you have the secret MK Tunnels.<br /><br />In 1948 the Department of Defence constructed a series of subterranean tunnels in the Navajo sandstone. This is one of six projects conducted, although the motives are unclear.<br /><br />Outlaws and bandits, such as Butch Cassidy, hid in the concealed caves, camouflaged until it was safe for them to move on. <br /><br />Who knows what other secrets this canyon holds and are yet to be discovered?<br /><br />PRODUCTS WE USE AND RECOMMEND:<br /><br />PROTECTING YOUR DATA<br />Donâ€™t get hacked.
