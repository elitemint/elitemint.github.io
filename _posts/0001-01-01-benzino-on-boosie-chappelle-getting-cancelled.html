Benzino stated that he's not surprised, adding that it's the status quo in America for white men to be acquitted for things they've done. He went on to slam Tucker Carlson and Black Lives Matter.<br /><br /><br /><br />He also spoke to Shawn Prez about his thoughts on Young Thug saying Atlanta will dominate hip-hop for the next 10 years, and Benzino thinks cities like Memphis and Jacksonville might have something to say about that. Benzino added that while Atlanta is still churning out a lot of hits, he thinks that other cities are also contributing.<br /><br /><br /><br />Later in the clip, Benzino offered his thoughts on Boosie's social media feud with Lil Nas X. The &quot;Love &amp; Hip Hop&quot; alum pointed out that he also caught backlash for criticizing Lil Nas X but was let off the hook once Boosie became the &quot;Montero&quot; rapper's most vocal critic. When Shawn Prez suggested he couldn't openly voice his opinion of the LGBTQ community due to cancel culture, Benzino rejected that notion and said Blacks were cancelled by society a long time ago. Benzino added that people who are &quot;aligned with the hood&quot; can never be cancelled and said he will continue to express his opinions.<br /><br />Interview by Shawn Prez<br /><br />Check out his youtube channel at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PowerMoveMakers">https://www.youtube.com/c/PowerMoveMakers</a>{% endraw %}
