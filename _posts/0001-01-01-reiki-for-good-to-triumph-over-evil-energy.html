All rights reserved.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Remote Reiki session for good to prevail over evil.<br /><br />Reiki is a Japanese energy-based healing modality that helps to restore the body's natural balance with the purpose of relaxation and stress reduction.<br /><br />Being in a sleep, awake, occupied or engaged in other activities while simultaneously <br />receiving Reiki, will never impair from its effectiveness. <br />Reiki always works for your highest good and most benevolent outcomes.<br /><br />The infinite wisdom of Reiki flows only where it is desired, affecting matter at subtle levels. Your personal acceptance and openness to receiving this healing  energy will dictate the level of energy to receive.<br /><br />You are encouraged to play this distance healing recording repeatedly as often  as you wish. This Reiki sessions can have cumulative effects, meaning, the healing  energy infused in these videos is amplified each time you play it.<br /><br />Each of us has our unique response to the healing energy and our experience can indeed vary from session to session. It depends on how sensitive someone is to energy. Just relax and enjoy this healing energy flowing to you.<br /><br />This is a &quot;real time&quot; Reiki session recorded from the beginning to end.  While channeling energy my focused and devoted attention will prevail throughout the session. Therefore, I do not speak and remain silent at all times. Soothing background music is used to further promote deeper relaxation during the session. <br /><br />In order for Reiki to work effectively, please be open to receiving the healing energy.<br />It is extremely beneficial to drink water after receiving Reiki as part of the healing process. <br /><br />Important Note: This content is not intended to be a substitute for proper medical diagnosis, treatment or specialist care from your Medical Practitioner / GP / Consultant or other qualified health professional.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />For more information, please visit:<br />🌎 In-Reiki.com ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.in-reiki.com">https://www.in-reiki.com</a> ◄<br /><br /><br />Social Media Links:<br />🐦 Twitter: ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/In_Reiki">https://twitter.com/In_Reiki</a> ◄<br />📌 Pinterest: ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://de.pinterest.com/InReiki/">https://de.pinterest.com/InReiki/</a> ◄<br />📷 Instagram ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/inreiki/">https://www.instagram.com/inreiki/</a> ◄<br /><br />🔔 Subscribe this channel ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DivineWhite...">https://www.youtube.com/c/DivineWhite...</a><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I did everything possible to ensure that you really enjoy this Free Reiki Video Session and I will do everything in my power, in case you need any help.
