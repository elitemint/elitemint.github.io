{% raw %}Within the last year, there have been sightings of a rare Steller’s Sea Eagle in Alaska, Nova Scotia, and now Massachusetts.  Never has it ever been recorded in the lower 48 states and here it was spotted in the Northeast just a few hours from me. Steller’s Sea Eagles are native to Russia, nearly 5,000 miles from the northeast of the US. There seems to be no real answer to why or how it got here, but it is an amazing story and I had to see if I could find it.{% endraw %}
