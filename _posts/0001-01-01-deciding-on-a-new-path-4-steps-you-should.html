{% raw %}Grains of Grace... Insight on DECISION MAKING:<br /><br />Jumping in head first works for some; feet first for others. Still, others wade apprehensively in the shallow end, while there are those who won't even go near the pool!<br /><br />Whatever your decision-making style, give as much thought as you can or as much as is required in the matter at the moment. And please SUBSCRIBE!<br /><br />Music: Kevin McLeod, by permission<br /><br />#DrViviMonroeCongress #YouCanDoIt #ANewPath #GrainsOfGrace #VoiceOfInspiration{% endraw %}
