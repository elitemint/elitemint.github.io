I guess time just flew<br /><br />I've got voices in my head<br />And there's a deafening silence<br />I've got voices in my head<br />And I can't lie<br /><br />I've been holding onto pieces<br />Swimming in the deep end<br />Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needing<br />A little bit of love<br />A little bit of love, I need a little love<br />Just like the air I'm breathing<br />These awful wounds ain't healing<br />Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needing<br />A little bit of love<br />A little bit of love, a little bit of love, a little bit of love<br /><br />I tried to fly but  too soon<br />Now everything I've been thinking of you<br />I tried a million times to cut you loose<br /><br />I've been holding onto pieces<br />Swimming in the deep end<br />Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needing<br />A little bit of love<br />A little bit of love, I need a little love<br />Just like the air I'm breathing<br />These awful wounds ain't healing<br />Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needing<br />A little bit of love<br />A little bit of love, a little bit of love, a little bit of love<br /><br />â€¢ Extra Tags:<br />Tom Grennan - Little Bit of Love<br />Tom Grennan - Little Bit of Love (Lyrics)<br />Tom Grennan - Little Bit of Love (Lyric Video)<br /><br />ðŸš¨ If you are the owner of any material/content used and uploaded on this channel and you want it removed don't hesitate to contact me, I will take it down immediately: business@lxxiv.ioðŸš¨<br /><br />#SurrealVibes #LYRICS #Tom Grennan{% endraw %}
