{% raw %}please do like and subscribe guys please<br /><br />#rulesandregulations<br />so the controversy is about Hikaru nakamura a great chess player.<br />so the thing what happened is while he was playing in CSL he used his phone (even declining phone call is considered as using) but according to rules no electronic gadgets is allowed to use and involved while the player is playing his game but as Hikaru used his phone he did get points although he won his match successfully <br />so as the rules are rules we should respect them ðŸ’¯ <br />because this league is not a joke ðŸ™„ conditions are strictly followed to keep it reputation as such big price pool is their<br />here Hikaru nakamura broken the rule which is also their in all the online chess competitive games <br />we can try to change if it was like 40 move rule <br />as it is not a special rule of league so I support it because rules are rules rules for all{% endraw %}
