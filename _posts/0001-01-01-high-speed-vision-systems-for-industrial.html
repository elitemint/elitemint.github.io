{% raw %}CSEM has developed ultra-high-speed sensors with on board intelligence. These systems analyze what is being captured reacting instantly. They can be used in real-time quality control, in high-speed inspection or in any other industry that requires smart imaging. Their intelligence is implemented close to the source of information, allowing them to extract and transmit only the relevant data. Our cameras and image sensors have already been proved in multiple industrial projects. New features are continuously being added, while the systems can be customized to meet your needs. Thanks to CSEM Intelligent High-Speed Vision solutions, the invisible becomes visible.{% endraw %}
