{% raw %}See why going to this show can increase your expertise in the hobby. Award winning builder, Greg Nichols, always encouraged fellow car modelers to attend an International Plastic Modelers' Society (IPMS) show, to expand their skills and recharge their creativity by seeing the scale model airplanes, ships, military, figures, Space and Science Fiction, alongside the automotive categories. Model Car Muse takes you to the October, 2021 IPMS - Hudson Valley Historical Miniatures Guild show in Poughkeepsie, NY.<br /><br />Hudson Valley Historical Miniatures Guild<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.hvhmg.org/expo.html">http://www.hvhmg.org/expo.html</a><br /><br />International Plastic Modelers' Society<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ipmsusa.org/">https://ipmsusa.org/</a><br /><br />IPMS-Northeastern NY Scale Modeling Group<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ipmsneny.org/">http://www.ipmsneny.org/</a><br /><br />Long Island Auto Replica Society<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.liarsmodelcarbuilders.com/">https://www.liarsmodelcarbuilders.com/</a><br /><br />Town of Newburgh Model Car Club<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TNMCC/">https://www.facebook.com/TNMCC/</a><br /><br />Granite State Modelers Club (GraniteCon)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.granitestatemodelersclub.org/">http://www.granitestatemodelersclub.org/</a><br /><br /><br />Music: 'Delta' by TrackTribe, YouTube Audio Library<br /><br />Â© 2021 by Model Car Muse.
