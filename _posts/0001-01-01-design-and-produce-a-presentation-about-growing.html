{% raw %}This is a unit with five inquiry teaching sequences about growing our food, fibre and shelter.<br />This unit encourages students to investigate a primary industry and the production practices it uses to produce a food or fibre.<br />After identifying a primary industry to research, students gather facts and information about where their chosen primary industry grows food, fibre or shelter and students design and produce a product of their chosen item from the beginning through to the end product.<br />Students explore citations like ‘From seed to salad’ ‘From grass to glass’ ‘From paddock to plate’; ‘From dirt to shirt’; ‘From farm to fork’; ‘From field to fabric’; ‘From boat to belly’ and ‘From pond to plate’ and pick their own production process to summarise using visual representations.{% endraw %}
