Being resilient is how single mothers go on to raise increible children. Being resilient is how generations that lived through war survive to tell the story and continue their traditions. The problem is that you may not feel resilient, and you may not have taken inventory lately to uncover how much adversity you’ve overcome. Adversity is the catalyst for change and the training agent we all need to bounce back from struggles with a stronger mind.<br /> <br />In part 4 of this series, Evy and Lisa are breaking down all the ways adversity and resilience make you the powerful badass woman that you are.

You are affected, you are not affecting the world. The world is only affecting you.” Evy Poumpouras [22:07]<br /> <br />“If it was my fault then it means that I have the power to do something about it. If it’s someone else’s fault, then I’m waiting for someone else to fix me.” Lisa Bilyeu [29:19]<br /> <br />“It’s not okay to be vicious and mean to people, and it takes a lot of work to control that.

Stop responding to everything.” Evy Poumpouras [56:04]<br /> <br />Follow Evy Poumpouras:<br /> <br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.evypoumpouras.com/">https://www.evypoumpouras.com/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/evypoumpouras">https://twitter.com/evypoumpouras</a><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/evypoumpouras/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/evypoumpouras/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/evypoumpouras/">https://www.facebook.com/evypoumpouras/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/evypoumpouras/">https://www.instagram.com/evypoumpouras/</a>{% endraw %}
