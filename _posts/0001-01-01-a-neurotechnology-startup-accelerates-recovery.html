Last year his company successfully launched devices, which use virtual reality, brain imaging and gaming technologies to retrain the brain in stroke victims. MindMaze is now developing solutions for spinal cord injury and amputee patients.<br /><br />Our brain decodes the world for us but what would happen if it malfunctioned? This happens daily to millions of patients around the world, seriously impairing their ability to carry out simple tasks we take for granted. Dr Tej Tadi explains his revolutionary multidisciplinary, multisensory approach which uses novel diagnostic and therapeutic metrics to accelerate brain recovery. He also gives tips on how to translate a concept into business reality.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations){% endraw %}
