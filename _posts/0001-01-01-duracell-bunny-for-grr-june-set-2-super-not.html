{% raw %}GRR radio returned once again, for another Friday night of madness, but, with social distancing rules relaxing slightly, we were able to put together a bit more of a party event.<br /><br />For my second set I asked myself the question, can I be more stupid than Karkasaurus?? And clearly I think the answer is yes. We had a couple of raids in, including the Does It Bang? pickle party, hence all the pickle puns. <br /><br />I was last on the lineup this time round so was able to extend my half hour slot into an hour using some of my extra time. This set is a fully cross genre hard dance mix of the best bootlegs the internet has to offer :D This set, however, started at 1am when I'd been excited and drinking for a while, so it definitely isn't me at my most sober. However, I like the choons and it was so much fun, I couldn't not upload!<br /><br />As usual, all audio recordings, and more, can be found at www.mixcloud.com/duracell_bunny and you can find me on Soundcloud <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/tes-matthews,">https://soundcloud.com/tes-matthews,</a> Facebook @DJDuracellBunny and Instagram @dj_duracell_bunny{% endraw %}
