{% raw %}Hi and welcome,<br /><br />Join me in this class of free movements to open up your body and free yourself of small pains and tension that is stored in the body. Explore, breathe, use your intuition and try not to force yourself but just simply move slowly and with awareness. <br /><br />Mixed with some self massage techniques for the head and shoulders this gives you some simple tools to use at any point if you feel you are getting stuck or are low on energy. <br /><br />Focus of this class:<br />- a mix of movements to energise yourself <br />- breath<br />- twists<br />- hip openers<br />- shaking<br />- self massage techniques<br /><br />Benefits of this class:<br />- creating a gentle sense of well being by slowly moving the body into different poses. <br /><br />I hope you enjoy this class.<br /><br />Feel free to leave a comment or send an email to info@tensiontamers.nl if you have any questions.<br /><br />Namaste!{% endraw %}
