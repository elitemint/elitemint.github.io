{% raw %}SCP 009 is a Euclid Class anomaly also known as Red Ice.<br /><br />SCP-009 is a substance that superficially resembles distilled water (H2O), except with a distinct bright red hue.<br />In contrast to mundane water, SCP009 assumes a liquid phase at temperatures between -100°C and 0°C, and a solid state above those temperatures. At temperatures below -100°C, SCP-009 vaporizes into a gaseous phase similar to steam.<br />It's suggested that SCP-009 may originate in a universe with alternate physical laws.<br />The most hazardous property of SCP-009, however, is its ability to contaminate normal H2O. When in contact with any aqueous solution, SCP-009 will, through unknown mechanisms, transfer its anomalous properties to other objects and creatures.<br /><br />LIKE &amp; SUBSCRIBE to SCP Explained - Story &amp; Animation<br /><br />Watch these other SCP videos we love:<br /><br />SCP–2935 – O, Death (SCP Animation)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7jLTXVxJdE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7jLTXVxJdE</a><br /><br />SCP-035 - The Possessive Mask (SCP Animation)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RipJc20LWrM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RipJc20LWrM</a><br /><br />SCP-354 - The Red Pool (SCP Animation)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scmL3fUL2-4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scmL3fUL2-4</a><br /><br />SCP-610 The Flesh that Hates (SCP Animation) ft. @SCP Animated - Tales From The Foundation by TheRubber<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJbcV-Iu2bU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJbcV-Iu2bU</a><br /><br />SCP-049 Plague Doctor (SCP Animated) by TheRubber<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-zgbiG-SO4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-zgbiG-SO4</a><br /><br />SCP-3199 Humans, Refuted (SCP Animation) by TheRubber<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiEMQb3ripE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiEMQb3ripE</a><br /><br />Join our Discord, share your SCP art, submit video feedback, chat with other fans...: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/scp">https://discord.gg/scp</a><br /><br />Please let us know in the comments which SCP's we should cover next <br /><br />Narrated by <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/hitherehunter">https://www.youtube.com/c/hitherehunter</a><br /><br />Content relating to the SCP Foundation, including the SCP Foundation logo, is licensed under Creative Commons Sharealike 3.0 and all concepts originate from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.scp-wiki.net">http://www.scp-wiki.net</a> and its authors. <br /><br />SCP-009 - Red Ice (SCP Animation) is based on &quot;SCP-009&quot; by Chameleon X: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-009">https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-009</a><br /><br />#scpexplained #scp #animation{% endraw %}
