{% raw %}Decided to make some improvements to the animation I uploaded about a month ago, partially for use with my final assignment in my Sound Design class. In addition to reworking the audio with Logic Pro X, I also added a bit more to the movement of the characters, largely in the ears and hair in addition to some of the pacing.<br /><br />(Side note: I don't own a Mac and Logic Pro X, I was just using the ones available at my college campus)<br /><br />Original Description: Little minute-long animation I've been working on. My first &quot;full&quot; animation of sorts, and also my first rigged animation.<br /><br />Pretty happy with it overall, although I do wish to improve.{% endraw %}
