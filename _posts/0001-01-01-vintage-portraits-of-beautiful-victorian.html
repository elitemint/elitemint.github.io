{% raw %}► Vintage Portraits of Beautiful Victorian Actresses<br />► Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode with Mystery Scoop. In the late 1600s, King Charles II issued a decree allowing women to play female roles in plays, that until then were solely played by men. Following the issuance of this decree, a number of actresses sprang up in theatre companies all over London. They eventually began to show that it was possible for women to make a living as actresses. Indeed, the lifestyles and acting techniques of Victorian women in Victorian theatres, paved the way for today's actresses. This was one of the first steps for women's equality in all professions.
