{% raw %}A review of the 1989 role playing game EarthBound Beginnings. Or Mother. Or EarthBound Zero. I use those terms interchangeably a lot of the time. It's a game that can be a bit divisive, but I tried to give it a fair shot.<br /><br />Chapters:<br />Intro: 0:00<br />Background Knowledge: 3:08<br />Music: 12:46<br />Story and Characters: 15:33<br />Gameplay: 20:00<br />Conclusion: 32:35<br /><br />The drawing of Ninten in the video thumbnail was done by GuyWithThePie!
