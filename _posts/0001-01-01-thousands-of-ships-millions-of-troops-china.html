{% raw %}Thousands Of Ships, Millions Of Troops China Is Assembling a Huge Fleet For War With Taiwan.<br />To have any chance of conquering Taiwan, China might need to transport as many as two million troops across the rough 100 miles of the Taiwan Strait and land them under fire at the island’s 14 potential invasion beaches or 10 major ports.<br /><br />That’s a lot of people—far, far more than the People’s Liberation Army Navy can haul in its 11 new amphibious ships. To transport the bulk of the invasion force, Beijing almost certainly would take up into naval service thousands of civilian ships.<br /><br />To that end, the Chinese Communist Party has created a legal and bureaucratic framework for taking over control of commercial shipping. Meanwhile, naval engineers have begun modifying key vessels to make them better assault ships.<br />All that is to say, the vast flotilla that would be both the vehicle for China’s assault on Taiwan—and the biggest target of Taiwanese forces and their allies—is taking shape.<br /><br />“If the PLA invasion force was a million or more men, then we might expect an armada of thousands or even tens of thousands of ships to deliver them, augmented by thousands of planes and helicopters,” Ian Easton, an analyst with the Project 2049 Institute in Virginia, wrote in a recent report.<br /><br />The PLAN’s eight modern Type 071 landing docks and three Type 075 big-deck assault ships together can haul around 25,000 troops. A drop in the bucket. To transport the balance of the invasion force, the Chinese navy can take up around 2,000 large <br />The legal framework is a new one. On Jan. 1, 2017, China’s National Defense Transportation Law went into effect. “Among other things, the law mandated that all of China’s basic infrastructure and related transportation platforms would henceforth be treated as military-civil fusion assets,” Easton explained.<br /><br />“At the CCP’s discretion, they were now legally required to be designed, built and managed to support future military operations. In the event of conflict, they would be pressed into wartime service. Now they had to prepare accordingly in peacetime.”<br /><br />According to Easton, the roughly 1,000 large vessels belonging to China COSCO Shipping Corporation could comprise the backbone of this improvised fleet.<br /><br />Engineers already had begun modifying certain vessels for their wartime roles. At least one heavylift ship got a removable helicopter deck, transforming it into an ad hoc assault ship.<br /><br />Perhaps the most important modification is a heavy ramp by which military vehicles speedily can drive from the hold of a ferry or roll-on/roll-off ship onto lighterage or a pier.<br /><br />“The ramp is driven directly by two large hydraulic cylinders and two support arms,” Conor Kennedy explained in a briefing for The Jamestown Foundation in Washington, D.C.<br />These modified civilian vessels aren’t idle. Their crews actively are training for a possible assault on Taiwan.{% endraw %}
