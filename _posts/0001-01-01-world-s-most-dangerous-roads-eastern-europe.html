{% raw %}World’s Most Dangerous Roads | Eastern Europe: The Adriatic Highway (2010)<br /><br />World’s Most Dangerous Roads - Mali: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/NI3yEN2U0sU">https://youtu.be/NI3yEN2U0sU</a><br /><br />The “Adriatic Highway” is one of the most beautiful coastal roads in the world. The “technical masterwork” was built in the 1950s and 60s, at the time of Yugoslavian President Tito. Abounding in curves, the asphalt road stretches from Ankaran in Slovenia to Ulcinj in Montenegro. More than half of the road is in Croatia (659 km) and a quarter in Montenegro (125 km). Shorter segments lead through Slovenia; only nine kilometers are in Bosnia and Herzegovina. For all four countries of the former Yugoslavian Federation, the 1,200-kilometer-long highway remains the main thoroughfare of Adriatic tourism. <br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />Subscribe Free Documentary Channel for free: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2YJ4XzQ">https://bit.ly/2YJ4XzQ</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG">https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI">https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI</a><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />#FreeDocumentary #Documentary #MostDangerousRoads<br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />Free Documentary is dedicated to bringing high-class documentaries to you on YouTube for free.
