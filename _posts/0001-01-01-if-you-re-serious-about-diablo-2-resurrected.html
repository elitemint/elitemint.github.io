{% raw %}Looking for a diablo 2 resurrected class tier list? Today we reveal the best class to play in d2.

I know my brother used to play barb back in the day and he would clear through swathes of monsters. But this was pre-patch 1.1 so let‚Äôs see how good the modern barb is really.<br /><br />In order to figure out how good the assassin is we‚Äôll look at the TOP 2 builds: The Lightning Trapsin and the Kicksin.<br /><br />You do need to be careful about the gear you get on your trapsin. For example items like Griffons eye which add to lightning skill damage and minus to enemy lightning resistance only apply if you yourself are dealing the damage, but traps are not you and these bonuses are not being applied to your traps!<br /><br />Overall trapsin is a TOP TIER build, one of the best in the game for clearing lots of monsters very easily. It‚Äôs a little weaker at fighting bosses with starter gear, and of course infinity is required if you want to get around immunes, but with the right gear, this build is a BEAST!<br /><br />Now lets talk about the kicksin. The kicksin is much different from the trapsin in that it‚Äôs a BOSS SLAYER. Kicksin is most famous for being an UBERS dominator. Literally this build is created for downing those pandemonium bosses. The build stacks lots of crushing blow, which does a fraction of the remaining life total of the target. Basically a % of their health per attack making SHORT WORK of bosses with massive health pools.<br /><br />The main skills being used are venom to add some dps in the form of posion damage and dragon talon as the primary damage dealing kick ability. <br /><br />To figure out how good the Amazon is, we‚Äôll look at 3 popular amazon builds: Lightning Javazon, Multishot Bowazon, and Poison Javazon.<br /><br />To determine how good sorceresses are we will look at 3 popular builds: Blizzard Sorc, Lightning Sorc, and Meteorb Sorc. We‚Äôll look at how Sorceresses compare in terms of leveling speed, magic finding builds, squishiness, and more. And at the end we‚Äôll decide HOW GOOD WAS THE SORCERESS REALLY?<br /><br />To determine how good druids are we will look at 3 popular builds: Wind Druid, Fury  Druid and Rabies Druid. We‚Äôll look at leveling speed, end game competitiveness, gear dependence and much more.<br /><br />Necromancers have some of the coolest abilities in the game, the ability to summon the dead, use magical bones as weapons and armor, and cast immensely powerful debilitating curses. These abilities make the Necromancer one of the strongest classes in diablo 2, but the class does not come without it‚Äôs own set of weaknesses. In this video we‚Äôll discuss the top 4 builds for necromancers: Poison Nova, Summoner/Fishymancer, Bone Spear, and Corpse Explosion.<br /><br />But besides being a great team player paladins are known for some of their very powerful builds such as the Blessed hammer / hammerdin, Dream /tesladin, Smiter, Zealot and Fist of the Heavens paladin.<br />Each of these builds have pros and cons, and are suited for different situations. And we‚Äôll discuss each one so you can decide for yourself how good the paladin is.<br /><br />diablo 2 resurrected new classes<br />best class diablo 2 resurrected<br />diablo 2 resurrected tier list reddit<br />diablo 2 class tier list reddit<br />diablo 2 pvp tier list<br />most op class in diablo 2<br />diablo 2 resurrected best class reddit<br />diablo 2 resurrected classes gender<br />diablo 2: resurrected new classes<br />diablo 2: resurrected classes gender<br />diablo 2 resurrected class tier list<br />diablo 2 resurrected best solo class<br />diablo 2 resurrected classes<br />diablo 2 resurrected builds<br />diablo 2 resurrected character creation<br />diablo 2 resurrected beta best class<br />diablo 2 resurrected best dps class<br />diablo 2 best builds reddit<br />diablo 2 necromancer builds<br />diablo 2 resurrected builds reddit<br />diablo 2 resurrected best class<br />diablo 2 best builds 2021<br />diablo 2 resurrected necromancer build<br />diablo 2 best builds<br />diablo 2 resurrected best starter builds<br />diablo 2 resurrected characters<br />diablo 2 resurrected classes ranked<br />diablo 2 resurrected class tier list<br />diablo 2 resurrected best class reddit<br />diablo 2 resurrected character models<br />diablo 2 best builds 2020<br />diablo 2 resurrected best builds<br />diablo 2 resurrected class builds<br />diablo 2: resurrected classes ranked<br />diablo 2 resurrected best first character<br />diablo 2 resurrected best characters<br /><br />#diablo #d2 #resurrected<br /><br />Thanks to Thunder Bob‚Äôs Gaming Emporium for the gameplay clips! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG5dmtzHsUeAmqGVSXghoGw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG5dmtzHsUeAmqGVSXghoGw</a>{% endraw %}
