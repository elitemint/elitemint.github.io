{% raw %}Over twenty years ago, rival nations put aside political and cultural differences and came together in a demonstration of international co-operation to create something unique-the International Space Station. For the first time in history, driven by his innate impulse to explore, man had a permanently inhabited foothold in the heavens. The Wonderful draws together personal stories from men and women from around the world who have been a part of this extraordinary endeavor, providing a fascinating insight into human nature and our relationship with planet Earth. These testimonials bring an intimacy and uniqueness to the story-bringing life in space alive, yet showing the strong emotional ties that bind these astronauts to the earth-and we are left not only with a sense of the vast 'velvet bottomless bucket' of the universe, but also the remarkable resilience and potential of mankind.{% endraw %}
