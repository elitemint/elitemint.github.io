{% raw %}One more year has passed and it's X-mas time again! So let's accompany Mega Man on a little journey like we already did twice in the past!<br />2020 was quite the year ...  let's hope for a better 2021. Kinda fittingly, even the game seems to have a much more serious touch than its two predecessors at the end.<br />Stay healthy and try to spent some nice days together with your families, folks!<br /><br />Download:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://sprites-inc.co.uk/thread-2795.html">http://sprites-inc.co.uk/thread-2795.html</a>{% endraw %}
