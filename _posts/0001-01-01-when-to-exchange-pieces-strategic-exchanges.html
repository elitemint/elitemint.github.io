However, many players often ask themselves if the trades or exchanges they did are the right decision. Also, when is the ideal time to exchange pieces or pawns? In this series, we want to help you to answer this question yourself by teaching you exchange guidelines that help you to take the right decision. You will learn that every exchange, doesn‚Äôt matter if it is a pawn or piece exchange, can be seen as a strategic decision, which shall bring you in an advantageous position.<br /><br />In this video, GM Markus Ragger will show you how to evaluate a piece exchange and when you should go for it.<br /><br />There are two ways how to approach a piece exchange:<br /><br />1. Compare the pieces that are about to be exchanged with each other: We compare the pieces that are about to be exchanged with each other. Ask yourself: What is the best piece of your opponent? Try to exchange the strongest piece of your opponent.<br /><br />2. Evaluating the resulting position: We don‚Äôt look at the pieces that are about to be exchanged but we are just focussing on the resulting position. Try to evaluate the resulting position. This makes a lot of sense when we exchange pieces with different strength, for example if we exchange a knight with a bishop or when we exchanging an attacking piece with a defending piece. <br /><br />üìò The pgn to this video can be downloaded on our website!<br />‚úèÔ∏è Don't miss to solve the provided exercises for this video on our website!<br /><br />‚Äî <br />‚≠êÔ∏è Social Media Links: <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/chessfactor">https://twitter.com/chessfactor</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Chessfactorofficial/">https://www.facebook.com/Chessfactorofficial/</a> <br />Lichess: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lichess.org/@/chessfactor">https://lichess.org/@/chessfactor</a> <br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/chessfactor">https://www.twitch.tv/chessfactor</a><br /><br /> ‚Äî <br />‚ôõ Chess Set Links:<br />‚û°Ô∏è Green chess set: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bestchesssetever.com/collections/chess-sets/products/triple-weighted-pieces-green-board">https://www.bestchesssetever.com/collections/chess-sets/products/triple-weighted-pieces-green-board</a> <br />‚û°Ô∏è Wooden chess set: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.chessware.de/Schachfiguren-Turnier-International-Holz-KH-95-mm">https://www.chessware.de/Schachfiguren-Turnier-International-Holz-KH-95-mm</a> <br /><br />‚Äî <br />#Chess #Chessfactor #ChessfactorIntermediate #ChessStrategy #PieceExchange{% endraw %}
