This time, I am flying on Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) B777-200/LR from Dubai to Islamabad. Find out the latest PIA in-flight service and passenger experience onboard the flight. PIA was the launch customer of the B777-200/LR. I flew on the prototype on my flight to Pakistan.<br /><br />After landing at Islamabad, I met up with PIA CEO Air Marshal Arshad Malik, he spoke openly about all the PIA issues and how he is going to fix the airline. We discussed issues about the EU blacklist, the credibility of the pilots and return PIA to profitability. Chief commercial officer Ali Qasim also discussed the latest fleet strategy and consolidation of European operations.<br /><br />PIA operated many rescue flights out of Kabul, Afghanistan, and flew about 5000-7000 people out. PIA spokesperson Abdullah Khan shared with me some of the first-hand details of the challenging operation in Kabul.<br /><br />Stay tuned for Part 2 next week, I flew an exciting PIA flight to Skardu in the Northern area of Pakistan.{% endraw %}
