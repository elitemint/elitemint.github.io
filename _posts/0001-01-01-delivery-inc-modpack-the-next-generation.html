These contracts are exactly matched with the progression of the mods. Initially, you receive orders by mail, but after a certain level, a computer is available to receive orders by E-Mail. Contract items can be sent either by letter or by parcel in the mailbox, or later with drones that can send cardboard boxes or barrels to the contractors. After an order is completed, you receive either a gift or money. Additionally, you receive experience points, which you can use to unlock items that you can order with the money you earned by completing contracts.<br /><br />Download Delivery Inc. - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/delivery-inc">https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/delivery-inc</a><br /><br />Music: Where We Wanna Go - Patrick Patrikios<br />#Minecraft​​ #DeliveryInc​​ #Modded{% endraw %}
