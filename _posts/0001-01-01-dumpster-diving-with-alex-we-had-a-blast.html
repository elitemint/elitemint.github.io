{% raw %}Hi friends and welcome back! If you couldn't tell, we had SO much fun dumpster diving at apartments and shops :D It's always a blast when Alex is able to come with me, especially when we ended up finding so many great items! I was surprised by all of the beverage mixes at the liquor store, we took what we could and hopefully others will find some as well. We normally would jump into a dumpster when it's so full like that, but there was too much broken glass at this one! <br /><br />As always, thank you so much for watching and I hope you enjoyed this video! Much love and happy diving xoxo<br /><br />Shop my Dumpster Finds + Stickers – www.breafkast.com/​<br /><br />Follow Me for More!<br />• Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/breafkast">https://instagram.com/breafkast</a><br />• TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@imbreafkast?">https://www.tiktok.com/@imbreafkast?</a><br />• Join The Breafkast Club on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/groups/breafkastclub">https://facebook.com/groups/breafkastclub</a><br />• Support: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/kellysparksphoto​">https://www.paypal.me/kellysparksphoto​</a><br />• Travel photography: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://society6.com/kellysparks/prints​">https://society6.com/kellysparks/prints​</a>{% endraw %}
