{% raw %}What is manual handling? Simply, manual handling is the movement of items by human energy. Manual handling includes lifting, holding, pushing, pulling, shifting and lowering.  In fact, any form of human exertion could be included -- with or without the use of mechanical aids.<br /><br />The Manual Handling training video available from Safetycare (updated May 18, 2017) covers all the basic training areas required in your manual handling programs.<br /><br />This manual handling training video covers:<br /><br /> * Detailed description of manual handling<br /> * The problems and how injuries are caused<br /> * The types of injuries<br /> * Steps to deal with manual handling<br /><br />The steps to deal with manual handling can often be addressed by following through a series of questions.  This process, the hierarchy of control measures asks the following:<br /><br /> * Must the load be moved?<br /> * Must it be lifted?<br /> * Can it be moved mechanically?<br /> * Can the load be reduced?<br /> * Can assistance be gained?<br /> * Is the load too heavy to safely lift?<br /><br />Manual handling (more specifically, lack of quality manual handling training) contributes directly to a significant percentage of work related accidents and injuries.  Manual handling is an issue that must be addressed as an ongoing subject in the workplace.<br /><br />For the very best in Manual Handling Safety Training Videos please go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.safetycare.com/">http://www.safetycare.com/</a>{% endraw %}
