{% raw %}Head Prefects of 2020, Taylem Barnard and Robert Bacon, have 'virtually' got together some words of advice and encouragement for our Year 12 students as they approach their Trial HSC Assessment Task block.<br /><br />Taylem's and Robert's cohort too faced the challenges of lockdown at various times in 2020, and with those memories in mind, they share some very practical advice that is helpful to all of us.{% endraw %}
