{% raw %}My sister asked me to come to my parents house and help her clean their attic. I agree because past year was hard for my and only recently I started going out more and spending some time with family looked fine. But when I got there I can't believe she did this. It was all just a trap.<br /><br />#redditsister #aitanarcissist #aitabirthday<br /><br /><br />If you want your story removed from a video, please email me at ask.elana.yt@gmail.com<br /><br />Submit your stories and chat with me at ask.elana.yt@gmail.com{% endraw %}
