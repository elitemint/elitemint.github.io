{% raw %}Hair mistakes that age you faster CURLY HAIR EDITION is FINALLY here! These are five common mistakes that I see curly hair folks make that are robbing youth from your appearance. Good thing is, they're EASY to fix once you know what they are. In this video I discuss how hair length effects the shape and curl, if you should layer your hair or not, what kind of products I recommend, as well as a big mistake people make during the drying process AND even the biggest color mistake I see ALL the time! SIDE NOTE, when I say &quot;youthful&quot;, I'm NOT talking about looking young, I'm talking about looking more vibrant, full of life and well...youthful at whatever age you are. <br /><br />Check out this video next to learn how to pick the best color for your skin tone: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/YC4wVH_qSMo">https://youtu.be/YC4wVH_qSMo</a> <br /><br />Below is a list ofMY FAVORITE TOOLS AND PRODUCTS with simple links you can use to find them. <br />My favorite blowdryers…<br />    My favorite one:     <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/34uK4Nb">https://amzn.to/34uK4Nb</a><br />    A more budget friendly one that I like as well:    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2VozfrJ">https://amzn.to/2VozfrJ</a><br /><br />My favorite Flat Iron:  <br />    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2XxwqHw">https://amzn.to/2XxwqHw</a><br /><br />The best all in one tool: <br />    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Xxwk2C">https://amzn.to/2Xxwk2C</a><br />   <br />The Best round brushes:<br />    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/39X82BO">https://amzn.to/39X82BO</a><br /><br />I LOVE this hairspray:<br />    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Xz9s2L">https://amzn.to/2Xz9s2L</a>   <br /><br />A great finishing wax (Ignore the “for men” part):<br />     <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2xfamHa">https://amzn.to/2xfamHa</a><br /><br />The Thinning shears I use<br />     <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/39YC0oY">https://amzn.to/39YC0oY</a><br /><br />The Straight shears I recommend for home use:<br />     <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2V1G7MI">https://amzn.to/2V1G7MI</a><br /><br />CONNECT WITH ME:<br />Instagram: @justin_hickox<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/justin.hickox.3">https://www.facebook.com/justin.hickox.3</a><br />www.Hickoxstudio.com<br /><br />Collaboration: HickoxHair@gmail.com{% endraw %}
