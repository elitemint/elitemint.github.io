{% raw %}Are You Wasting Precious Time? Time Management Tips for Wealth Seekers<br /><br />In pursuing your goal to attain wealth or Financial Freedom, are really using your time productively? If your picture of Financial Freedom does not speak to your Time, it is not true Financial Freedom. It is definitely not freedom, and I don’t know if I am ready to believe such a status without taking into consideration ‘time’ is any to write home about even from a financial perspective. Can you be financially free without being time rich?<br /><br />More than this, what does the use of your time look like while you are still on your journey towards financial freedom? How do you spend your time today while in pursuit of this goal? Are you using your time in a way that is keeping you from achieving this goal? Yes, you are very busy, I get it, but are you being productive, not just productive in your vocation, but in your overall goal to one day be financially free? Are you using your time efficiently?<br /><br />My name is Nyiko Mongwe and I have been a Financial Advisor for 8 years now. Real Estate, although often trivialized and romanticized, is not an easy way to become rich or wealthy and retire early, but thankfully, it is a game that is relatively easy to learn how to play. Just make sure that you learn to use your credit as leverage and not as debt. Once you know the difference you are well on your way to building Financial Freedom. <br /><br />If you want to learn how to build wealth, check this video out.<br /><br />To help support this channel and keep content about Personal Finance and How To Achieve Financial Freedom coming, please SUBSCRIBE and TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS – Let me know if my video is useful so that I can keep uploading and improving my Financial Education and sharing my knowledge and experiences to help to improve your Financial Literacy.
