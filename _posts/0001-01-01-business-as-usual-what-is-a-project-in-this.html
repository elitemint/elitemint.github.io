{% raw %}In this video, director of Knowledge Train, Simon Buehring, answers the question, 'What is a Project?'<br /><br />To help define a project, we will compare the characteristics of a project to those of the day-to-day work we might call 'Business As Usual' (BAU).<br /><br />This question is important because business owners and project managers must quickly identify when a 'business as usual' task becomes a project. If we don't, there's a chance that time and resources might be wasted on a job that would have benefited from oversight and planning.<br /><br />It's also important to identify when something isn't a project. Sometimes the best way of achieving a goal is to let staff 'get on with it' - without interference or micro-management from senior staff.<br /><br />Some key features of a project are:<br />• Projects create a single product. BAU reproduces the same item. A project may introduce a new IT. BAU would be using the system after release.<br />• Projects are temporary. BAU continues indefinitely.<br />• Projects have bespoke plans created to meet the deliverables of the project. BAU follows general internal procedures that maintain the business.<br />• Projects are funded from the capital budget after the business case is accepted by stakeholders. BAU is funded from the operational budget.<br />• A project is fundamentally a change initiative, bring in something new that will benefit the organisation. BAU simply maintains the consistency of an organisation.<br /><br />If you're interested in earning a recognized project management qualification, click the link below to see a selection of project management online courses:<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.knowledgetrain.co.uk/project-management/project-management-courses-online-uk">https://www.knowledgetrain.co.uk/project-management/project-management-courses-online-uk</a>  <br /><br />Knowledge Train helps organizations improve their capacity to manage projects through high-quality training solutions.
