{% raw %}How Don Vito Corleone Made an offer They Can't Refuse | Lessons from The Godfather<br />By the end of this Video, You too will be able to be like the godfather, Make an Offer They Can't Refuse.....<br />How was the Godfather, Don Vito Corleone always able to get what he wants, what was his secret to making an offer they can’t refuse, and is it possible for you to learn these secrets and techniques in real life, well the answer is surprisingly yes.<br />Here’s Why,<br />Although the character of Vito Corleone was a notorious mafia don, his entrepreneurial and business techniques are commonly used by CEO’s, world leaders and so many other successful individuals. So we will be breaking down how the don manages to win every negotiation he is in, and how we can replicate his techniques in real life.  <br /><br />By the end of this Video, You too will be able to be like the godfather, and win every negotiation.<br /><br />To successfully get what you want from a negotiation, you need to be prepared.<br />Vito was truly a master of this. Before Vito would even meet with anyone, he would have his people investigate these individuals in depth, to then analyse what their potential intentions and goals may be. <br />It’s the benefit of Vito surrounding himself with highly skilled and capable people, such Tom Hagen. Vito would task Tom Hagen to research everything possible about the individual, and report it prior to even meeting them. We see this prior to the dons meeting with Virgil Sollozzo, where Tom breaks down everything the godfather wanted to know. But why would this be so essential you might ask,  well for Vito, he wanted to know how to approach the meeting.<br />There are various factors that force Vito to have to do this, primarily to uncover Sollozzo ambitions. Don Corleone being at the top of the mafia, means that he is also the biggest target, and people are laws scheming to dethrone him. And surely enough that’s indeed what happened. What’s interesting, is that with the information he has, it was enough for him to make his decision, however Vito still meets with him for 2 reasons, firstly out of respect to those who vouched for Sollozzo and not to create unnecessary enemies. But secondly, and more importantly, as Tom Hagen explains, this proposition could benefit their enemies giving them an advantage in the years to come if they don’t go into it first. So Vito was thinking long term implications of this deal, therefore went into the meeting with that mindset. We can go further into the importance of gathering knowledge and doing research, but what’s important to take away is, the more you know about the other side, the more prepared and effective your tactics will be.<br /><br />𝑬𝒏𝒋𝒐𝒚 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒗𝒊𝒅𝒆𝒐 &amp; 𝑳𝒆𝒕 𝒖𝒔 𝒌𝒏𝒐𝒘 𝒘𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒀𝒐𝒖 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒌?🔥<br /><br />Part 1: Before the Negotiation<br />Build reputation<br />Gathers info<br />Knows what he wants <br />Knows what they want<br /><br />Part 2: During the Negotiation<br />Go In Prepared<br />Conceal Intentions<br />Make it mutually beneficial<br /><br />🌹 The Godfather: 50th Anniversary Edition Novel<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3sDA1jl">https://amzn.to/3sDA1jl</a><br />📚🎧 Audible Free Trial<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3E7BzJ1">https://amzn.to/3E7BzJ1</a><br />𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝟒𝟖 𝐋𝐚𝐰𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3ydIVs6">https://amzn.to/3ydIVs6</a><br /><br />📸 𝐉𝐨𝐢𝐧 𝐔𝐬 𝐎𝐧 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐚 @𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐂𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐌𝐚𝐟𝐢𝐚<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/theculturemafia/">https://www.instagram.com/theculturemafia/</a><br /><br />Time Stamp:<br />0:00 What was his Secret?<br />0:50 Lesson1: Building Reputation<br />1:07 Law 5 of Power<br />1:35 Vito Before Becoming The Godfather<br />2:10 How Vito Built His Reputation<br />3:05 Here’s What You do…<br />3:33 Lesson 2: Be Prepared<br />4:10 Research Everything You Might Need<br />4:30 Why Did Vito Always Do This?<br />5:55 How You Can Use it<br />6:36 Why is it So Important?<br />7:00 Know What You Want<br />7:28 Know What They Want<br />9:05 During the Negotiation<br />9:30 Always Be in Control<br />10:00 Lesson 3: Conceal Your Intentions<br />12:20 Leverage Your Position<br />12:40 Use Their Ego Against Them<br />13:03 You are Now Ready<br />13:32 The Next Step Up<br />13:40 What Advice Do You Have?<br />13:50 Do You Want More?<br /><br />𝐓𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐤 𝐘𝐨𝐮 𝐅𝐨𝐫 𝐖𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠<br />_________________________________________________________________<br /><br />All materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
