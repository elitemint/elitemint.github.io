And if you ask them, a lot of them will tell you that they’re afraid of...sharks! Yup. That’s the main reason they don’t like to swim in open water. Now, when you look at the numbers, the chances of getting attacked by a shark really depend on the place where you live. And there are plenty of other bad things that could happen to you before you get bitten by a shark. I guess what I’m trying to say is...don’t be so scared of these predators! Don’t let them keep you from enjoying the ocean. And in today’s video, I’ll be showing you 10 animals that could defeat a shark. Some of them are extinct, some of them are still alive. But I just hope that this video can make you feel a bit less scared of sharks… in case you feel that way! <br /><br />Let’s begin.<br /><br />Hippos<br /><br />The chances of a hippo coming face to face with a shark are very low. Hippos prefer freshwater habitats while sharks are usually in saltwater. However, there are some places in the world where these two could easily meet - especially in some regions of Africa. And in case you haven’t guessed it yet...the hippo is more likely to win this face-off. With their big bodies and their sharp teeth, they are considered some of the deadliest beasts on Earth. Every year, they kill around 500 people in Africa, and sometimes, the way they do it is simply by sitting on their victims. Their skin is so thick, that it could easily stand the poor attempts of a shark trying to bite them. And if they wanted to, they could kill the shark by simply sitting on it, or with just a few bites.<br /><br />Lions<br />There’s no way that a lion will ever have to worry about a shark. But let’s say that sharks evolve and are able to walk on land, or lions evolve and are able to swim in the ocean. Then, we would have to ask ourselves, which one of these two would have a better chance of survival if they get into a fight? Who would be the ultimate predator alive on Earth? As we all know, lions are considered the kings of the jungle, but could they also be the kings of the ocean if they were able to swim? Based on their records, it’s safe to assume that they would have a chance. They’re responsible for at least 100 human deaths per year. Whenever they get a chance, they will hunt and eat humans. Their powerful bite is hardly matched by any other predator in the world, and with their agility, they could easily dodge the attacks of a shark and respond with a more powerful attack that could end the life of any threatening underwater predator.<br /><br /><br />Alligators<br />Speaking of huge bites, large jaws, and sharp teeth, we also have to consider the alligators! Along with the bears, alligators are among the animals that humans fear the most. Why? Because we’re very likely to find them without any difficulty if we ever visit their habitats. And if you live in Florida or in any other part of the South of the US, then you’re more likely to see them without having to leave your house. Every now and then you’ll read terrifying headlines and fun Instagram posts about people who find these animals in their homes. And an encounter with an alligator should not be taken lightly...they are wild predators ready to attack. The good news is that they are only responsible for a handful of deaths per year. They don’t kill as many humans as other animals do. But if you put them in front of a shark they could easily kill the aquatic beast or at least put on a very strong fight. <br />Elephants<br />Elephants are huge, but they’re also so gentle. And sometimes, these mammals kill other creatures by accident. They’re so big that they can destroy a person or an animal by simply stepping or sitting on them. No wonder they’re responsible for more than 100 human deaths every year! For that reason, it is safe to assume that they could easily destroy a shark if they ever came in close contact with one of these predators. And you’re probably thinking, “But the shark can bite the elephant!” - and you’re right, the shark does have a jaw big enough to bite the elephant, but the elephant would probably run away and accidentally step on the shark before the predator even gets a chance to open its jaw wide open.<br />Whales{% endraw %}
