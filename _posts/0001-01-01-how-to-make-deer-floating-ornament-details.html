{% raw %}DETAILS INCLUDED HERE.<br />Here is a quick tutorial to show you how I make my  design - &quot;deer in snow&quot; floating Christmas ornaments. I created it with images i found in Cricut Design Space.<br /><br />I have had an amazing response to this video and wanted to update in here to include the answers to the questions I have been getting most often.<br /><br />ORNAMENTS - from Michaels, Canada - 25pk - plastic - 3 inch.<br /><br />SNOW - Crafters Square (brand) 01.48oz (42g bag) - from Dollerama, I think.<br /><br />RIBBON - Micheals, Canada<br /><br />TREE IMAGE - # M8FD812B - search in images - Cricut Design Space<br /><br />TREE - Cricut Premium Permanent Vinyl<br /><br />DEER - # MF37BO22 - woodland winter scene - CDS<br /><br />DEER - Cricut Adhesive Foil - Stainless. Colour not on it but its kinda teal. I make this ornament with many different colours or deer and ribbon.<br /><br />ACETATE CENTRE - I created this myself from a circle and welding a small square to the top to create the tab. The tab sits in the neck so that it doesn't move once inside.<br />Dimensions - .66x372.88x3.2  Thickness of acetate is unknown, sorry, not on the packaging and too thin to measure.<br />Acetate sheets are from Amazon or Michaels. 12x12 pack of 12 sheets.<br />No brand name on them. <br />Recollections and Cricut also sell acetate.<br /><br />If you have any more questions , please add them in the comments below and I will be happy to answer them.<br />Thank you for watching and Happy Crafting!{% endraw %}
