{% raw %}0:00 - Introduction<br />8:55 - Meditation<br /><br />All beliefs and perceptions are created from past experiences. A belief is just a thought you keep thinking over and over again until it’s hardwired in your brain. Since feelings and emotions are the end products of past experiences, the boundaries of our beliefs are your familiar feelings.<br /><br />In order to change a belief or a perception about yourself, you must be instructed to make a decision with such firm intention that the amplitude of energy of that choice causes your body to respond to a new mind. When the choice that you make becomes an experience that you never forget, you are biologically changing your brain and body out of the past familiar reality into a new future reality. <br /><br />This meditation will teach you how to rewire your brain and recondition your body to a new mind by changing one subconscious belief or perception of your choice that keep you repeating the same patterns in your life.<br /><br />For further information regarding the purpose and benefits of these meditations, please refer to Chapter 12 in You Are the Placebo.
