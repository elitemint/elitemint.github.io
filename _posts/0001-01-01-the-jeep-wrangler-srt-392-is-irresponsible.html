{% raw %}Thanks to Valvoline for sponsoring todays video! Ask for it by name at your local auto parts store! <br /><br />The Jeep Wrangler Rubicon SRT 392 is as ridiculous to operate as you think it is. It sounds, moves, and drives like a car from the 1960's... on pavement. It has way more engine than chassis, way more engine than steering, way more engine than brakes. It gets 10 miles per gallon. It will wake everyone up in a five block radius on cold starts. But, because a V8 engine is just generally so much more pleasant to operate than a humdrum six-cylinder, it's also the most special. And when you take it into the dirt, it really starts to make sense. <br /><br />Jeep provided the vehicle, insurance, and a tank of gas for this review. <br /><br />IUse Off The Record! and ALWAYS fight your tickets!
