{% raw %}Inflation will not dissipate any time soon says Will Rhind, founder and CEO of Graniteshares, despite the Biden administration's efforts to calm down the economic pressures attributed to the current inflation crisis. Rhind discusses the $7.5 trillion added in debt to the U.S.'s balance sheet since the beginning stages of Covid-19 crisis with our Daniela Cambone, and why gold is one of the only places to hide. &quot;It's very difficult to raise rates in this environment where we have inflation with a backdrop of record high debt levels, he argues. &quot;Record high stock markets and record high inflation can't go on forever,&quot; Rhind concludes, &quot;and when the market acknowledges there is a problem with inflation, there aren't many places to hide.&quot;{% endraw %}
