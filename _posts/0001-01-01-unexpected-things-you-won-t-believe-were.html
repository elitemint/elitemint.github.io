It's not very common but it sometimes occurs. For instance -<br />Ghosts : Ouija board is a &quot;paranormal&quot;game that supposedly calls on spirits and most people are scared of playing it, for a good reason. A couple of friends play with the ouija board and it doesn't go as they expected it to , and what happens next will chill you to the bone.<br />Anomaly : Teleportation is still being studied by experts and at some level it has been achieved, but only if we're talking about very small objects. In this video a driver spots what's supposed to be teleportation caught on camera and in this case it's an entire person ,  is it real or is it a glitch?<br />Creepy Randonautica : Randonautica is a new game that many consider to be sort of weird. It takes you to random places and usually nothing happens, but in some cases , it's different. A YouTuber goes on a crazy adventure that doesn't go as expected.<br />Petrifying well : Have you ever heard of this mysterious place ? In it you can place any object just below the well and after a while the object will become stone - is it as mysterious as it looks ? Watch and find out !
