{% raw %}Jeff Clark, precious metals analyst at goldsilver.com told me that if he had to only pick 3 gold &amp; silver stocks, he'd pick a stock in each tier. Meaning, he would pick a producer, a developer, and an explorer. <br /><br />Interestingly enough Jeff Clark didn't mention any royalties off the bat, so I had to take that out of him and asked him why he didn't mention a royalty gold &amp; silver stokc in his top 3 gold &amp; silver stocks list. He told me he'd prefer to take on more risk. <br /><br />Royalties are a great risk-reward option, that will likely outperform physical gold &amp; silver, but Jeff is looking for greater returns than that. He also thinks that royalties are often trading at a premium, and for a good reason, too. Because they offer superior business models but not the sale leverage to the gold &amp; silver price that Jeff is looking for.<br /><br />Eventually, Jeff did tell me that he likes Sandstorm Gold as his royalty play but it wouldn't be in his top 3 gold &amp; silver stocks.<br /><br />The top 3 gold &amp; silver stocks that Jeff Clark talked about were:<br />1. First Majestic Silver Corp. (NYSE: AG) (TSX: FR)<br />2. Cassiar Gold Corp. (TSXV: GLDC)<br />3. Ascot Resources Ltd. (TSE: AOT)<br /><br />As an option, as mentioned above, Jeff Clark also gave me his top royalty play:<br /><br />- Sandstorm Gold Ltd. (NYSE: SAND) (TSE: SSL)<br /><br />This is not the full interview. <br /><br />During the full interview, we talked about Jeff Clark himself, where he grew up, how he found the gold &amp; silver space, why he decided to risk it all and become a gold &amp; silver analyst, his internship with Doug Casey &amp; Lobo Tigrre and much more.<br /><br />We talked about the FED, tapering, inflation, and what's a good way to protect at least some of my wealth during these uncertain times. <br /><br />You can watch the full interview, for free, at:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.baby-investments.com/interviews">https://www.baby-investments.com/interviews</a><br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br />00:00 Important note &amp; introduction<br />00:49 First Majestic Silver<br />04:55 Cassiar Gold Corp.<br />06:35 Ascot Resource <br />09:30 Gold &amp; Silver royalties<br />11:30 The interview continues<br /><br />Although I greatly appreciate your presence here, you shouldn't appreciate mine and you shouldn't put any importance on what I have to say, what I do nor what I think. I'm an inexperienced 26-year-old who has a high risk appetite and will likely lose a lot of money before he learns how not to.
