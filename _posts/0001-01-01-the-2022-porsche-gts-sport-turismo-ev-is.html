{% raw %}I’ve pushed the Porsche Taycan GTS sedan at Willow Spring International Raceway and learned that fade-free electric performance can be a truly beautiful thing. But how does this track monster behave in the real world? The GTS Sport Turismo gets the same street/track personality and adds a wagon-like rear to make performance driving practical. It’s the best of all worlds, if you have the disposable income for an EV that begins at around $135K. Tom Voelk zooms up it California’s famed Angeles Crest Highway and has a great time getting lost on the way to the track. <br /><br />Special thanks to Pete Stout who's the mastermind behind the beautiful 000 Magazine.
