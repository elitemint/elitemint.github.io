{% raw %}Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.<br />Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the YAHWEH's servant?<br />Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not.<br />YAHWEH is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable. Isaiah 42:18-21<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.houseofyisraelatl.org/">https://www.houseofyisraelatl.org/</a><br />Please Subscribe To Our YouTube Channel!!!<br />12/11/2021{% endraw %}
