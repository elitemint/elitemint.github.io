{% raw %}With each passing year, electric mountain bikes get more and more legit. What’s up Vital MTBers, we’re going to walk you through our Shreddy-award-winning favorite e-mountain bikes as we head into 2022. While e-bike land is still a bit of the wild west in terms of technology and bike styles, we’ve chosen a heavy, full-sized ebike and a lightweight offering. Prices on these ever-evolving, tech-heavy two-wheelers are generally not for the faint of heart, so if you’re hoping to get a trail-ready e-mountain bike for less than the price of a used Yaris, you may want to brace yourself. Enjoy links to the full reviews below, so you can do more research to decide which e-bike might be best for you. Also, keep in mind that pricing and availability on these bikes could change in the blink of an eye.<br /><br />Marin Alpine Trail E2 Long-Term Review - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9A27XKr1vs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9A27XKr1vs</a><br />Orbea Rise Long-Term Review - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE4QpI28oQI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE4QpI28oQI</a><br /><br />Thanks for tuning in. We know that e-bikes or regular mountain bikes aren’t cheap and it’s easy to want the latest and greatest, but from everyone at Vital, we hope that the ride, not the bike, is why you’re out having fun on two wheels. We’ll see you on the trails!<br /><br />#eMTB #electricmountainbike #ebike<br />Video Contents<br />0:00 - Introduction<br />0:49 - Marin Alpine Trail E2<br />2:36 - Orbea Rise<br /><br />See Vital's favorite mountain bikes going in 2022 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nMlZDrybe8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nMlZDrybe8</a>{% endraw %}
