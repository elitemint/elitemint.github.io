You might recall the episode from Detroit, MI when we went inside Atlas Tube to see how RV axles are made. @Newell Coach makes some of the finest (and most expensive) RVs on the market. They don't make very many each year compared to other RV brands, and they build them on their own chassis in a single plant‚Äîwhich happens to be directly off Route 66 in Oklahoma. The start-to-finish process of building a $2,500,000 RV is impressive to say the least, but the paint schemes on these rigs will blow you away! In this episode, we popped into Newell Coach hoping we'd hit a good time for a plant tour, and we got lucky. Brian shared every step of the process with us, from building the superstructure to the finished product. Join us inside Newell Coach to see some of the latest RV innovations out there.<br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏è KYD Insiders <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/KeepYourDaydream">https://www.patreon.com/KeepYourDaydream</a> <br />Join the most supportive and genuine RV community ever.
