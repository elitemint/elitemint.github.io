{% raw %}All the directors together are the board. They meet in the boardroom.<br />Non-executive directors are not managers of the company; they are outsiders, often directors of other companies who have particular knowledge of the industry or of particular areas.<br /><br />The marketing director is the head of marketing, the IT director is the head of IT, etc. These people head or head up their departments. Informally, the head of an activity, a department or an organization is its boss.<br />An executive or, informally, an exec, is usually a manager at quite a high level (for example, a senior executive). But 'executive' can be used in other contexts to suggest luxury, as in 'executive coach' and 'executive home', even for things that are not actually used by executives.<br /><br />In the US, the top position may be that of Chairman, Chairwoman or President. This job is often combined with the position of Chief Executive Officer or CEO. Some companies have a Chief Operating Officer to take care of the day-to-day running of the company. The finance director may be called the Chief Financial Officer.<br /><br />In the US, senior managers in charge of particular areas are often called Vice Presidents (VP's).{% endraw %}
