(Alright)<br />Baby, it's your world, ain't it? (Uh)<br /><br />[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]<br />She got a n*gga at home, and one on the side<br />Best friend is a dyke, they fucked around a few times<br />Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight<br />I tell her make me some money, she tell me, &quot;Make me a wife&quot;<br />I tell her, &quot;Bitch, you crazy, fuck wrong with you?&quot;<br />And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser<br />And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'<br />And I say, &quot;What about them n*ggas?&quot; She say, &quot;What about them n*ggas?&quot;<br />You right, what you doing tonight?<br />Put on something tight, don't judge me, I get life<br />She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband<br />Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in<br />All I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle<br />Pussy so wet, I'ma need goggles<br />She tell me that's it's mine, I tell her stop lyin'<br />Mine and who else? She say worry 'bout yourself<br />Lil Tune<br /><br />[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]<br />They holler at me, but it's you<br />You, this ain't high school<br />Me and my crew, we can slide through<br />Give it to you whenever you want<br />Put it wherever you want<br />Baby, it's yours<br />Anywhere, everywhere<br />Baby, it's your world, ain't it?<br />Baby, it's your world, ain't it?<br /><br />[Outro: Nicki Minaj]<br />I know you want it, boy<br />I see you tryin'<br />Just keep on pushin'<br />I'ma let you slide in<br />Just close your eyes and<br />This horizon<br />It's ready, come get you some<br />Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah{% endraw %}
