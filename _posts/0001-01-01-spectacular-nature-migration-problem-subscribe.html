{% raw %}ðŸ”” Subscribe - I made this video to raise awareness of the crab migration big problem,  to protect animal habitats. My video contributed to construction of the barrier and under road passages to protect the crabs during annual migration. <br />Many viewers of the video pressed Cuban authorities to do something about that. <br />I don't know this tourist in the car who drive over the crabs, but there is no anther road. <br />Cubans should close this road during the migration.<br />Crab Migration is an unusual occurrence, happens every year in May in Bay of Pigs Zapata peninsula  in Cuba. <br />More:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://netssa.com/bay_of_pigs_cuba.html">http://netssa.com/bay_of_pigs_cuba.html</a>{% endraw %}
