A high five from me to you: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drchatterjee.com/fridayfive">https://drchatterjee.com/fridayfive</a><br /><br />Human beings were born to run. No sooner have we learned to walk than we’re breaking into a run – it’s just another gear. So why do so many of us struggle with running as adults? <br /><br />Today’s guest, Helen Hall, is the running coach I’ve been working with for the past 18 months and who trained me for my recent marathon. As founder of Perpetual Forward Motion Efficient Running Coaching her clients range from elite athletes to ordinary amateurs who want to run or walk pain-free, with greater efficiency and, most importantly, with greater enjoyment. It’s no exaggeration to say Helen has had a profound effect on my life. So I’m delighted to be able to share her wisdom with you in this conversation, which is relevant whether you’re an experienced runner, a novice, or even if running doesn’t appeal at all. <br /><br />#feelbetterlivemore <br />----<br /><br />Helen Hall’s video series <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.helen-hall.co.uk/product/the-pfm-wujwum-series/">https://www.helen-hall.co.uk/product/the-pfm-wujwum-series/</a><br />Helen’s book - Even With Your Shoes On <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.helen-hall.co.uk/product/even-with-your-shoes-on/">https://www.helen-hall.co.uk/product/even-with-your-shoes-on/</a><br /><br />Connect with Helen:<br />Website <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.helen-hall.co.uk">https://www.helen-hall.co.uk</a><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/helen_10pt">https://twitter.com/helen_10pt</a><br />Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/helenhallpfm/">https://www.instagram.com/helenhallpfm/</a><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PerpetualForwardMotion/">https://www.facebook.com/PerpetualForwardMotion/</a><br /><br />#feelbetterlivemore #feelbetterlivemorepodcast <br />------- <br />Sign up to my new newsletter - Friday Five <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drchatterjee.com/fridayfive">https://drchatterjee.com/fridayfive</a> <br />Feel Great Lose Weight is now available to order in the UK <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2W6bsOE">https://amzn.to/2W6bsOE</a> and in the US &amp; Canada <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2GWPgls">https://amzn.to/2GWPgls</a> <br />Dr Chatterjee’s book Feel Better in 5 is out now in the UK <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2G0XK7l">https://amzn.to/2G0XK7l</a> and in the US and Canada <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2EB2oM0">https://amzn.to/2EB2oM0</a> <br />Order Dr Chatterjee’s book The Stress Solution <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2MZ8u8h">https://amzn.to/2MZ8u8h</a> <br />Find Dr Chatterjee’s 4 Pillars of Health in The 4 Pillar Plan available via <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2yGfpuB">http://amzn.to/2yGfpuB</a> <br />The US version, How to Make Disease Disappear is available via <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Gj1YEL">https://amzn.to/2Gj1YEL</a> <br />----- <br />Listen to all previous podcast episodes on <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drchatterjee.com/podcast">https://drchatterjee.com/podcast</a> or via these podcast platforms by searching for 'Feel Better, Live More'. <br />Apple Podcasts - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/feel-better-live-more/id1333552422?mt=2">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/feel-better-live-more/id1333552422?mt=2</a> <br />Acast - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.acast.com/feelbetterlivemore">https://www.acast.com/feelbetterlivemore</a> <br />Stitcher - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/feel-better-live-more">https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/feel-better-live-more</a> <br />Spotify - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6NyPQfcSR9nj0DPDr2ixrK">https://open.spotify.com/show/6NyPQfcSR9nj0DPDr2ixrK</a> <br />----- <br />Follow Dr Chatterjee at: <br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drchatterjee.com/">https://drchatterjee.com/</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/drchatterjee">https://www.facebook.com/drchatterjee</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/drchatterjeeuk">https://twitter.com/drchatterjeeuk</a> <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/drchatterjee/">https://www.instagram.com/drchatterjee/</a> <br />Newsletter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drchatterjee.com/subscription">https://drchatterjee.com/subscription</a> <br /><br />DISCLAIMER: The content in the podcast and on this webpage is not intended to constitute or be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
