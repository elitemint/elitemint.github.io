{% raw %}As we promised here is some more footage of flood damage happening today Nov 28.  We also check in on our neighbours Mike and Ute who have been confined to this portion of the Coquihalla Hwy too.  Today's storm means that our bridge to town may be postponed again.  At dawn tomorrow we'll find out the extent of the damage.{% endraw %}
