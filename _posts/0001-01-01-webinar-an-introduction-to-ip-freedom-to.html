{% raw %}Are you ready to commercialise your invention? What do you know about other people’s patents? Do you have Freedom to Operate?<br /><br />Hosted by Dehns Partner and UK Patent Attorney Philip Webber on 20 August 2020, this webinar outlines the reasons for undertaking an FTO search and the 3 stages of the FTO search and analysis.<br /><br />Having your own patent does not mean that you can ignore other people’s patents. Before you start commercialising your invention, it is prudent to do a Freedom to Operate (FTO) search to try to find any patents that are relevant to your product or process.<br /><br />Philip is a qualified UK and European patent attorney, and a partner in Dehns’ Life Sciences Group with a degree in Natural Sciences (Genetics) from Cambridge University and a PhD in molecular biology from Warwick University. His work is largely with start-ups, small/medium size companies and universities with inventions in the pharmaceutical or biotechnological fields. He has over 25 years’ experience in dealing with the issues which are important to such entities, such as the financial constraints of start-ups, the need to develop IP strategies for a company’s products and the pressures upon academics to publish their work. <br /><br />Philip’s work involves writing and filing patent applications, and getting them granted for his clients all around the world. He has particular expertise in obtaining European patents (including dealing with EPO Opposition and Appeal procedures) and US patents. He also provides advice on IP landscapes and Freedom to Operate (FTO) advice on competitors’ patents.<br /><br />The information in this webinar is given as guidance only. Legal advice should be sought for particular matters. Dehns accepts no responsibility for any action taken / not taken on the basis of this webinar.<br /><br />www.dehns.com{% endraw %}
