{% raw %}What is the best diet for longevity? in this video, i tackle this question taking insight from the book i just finished reading, &quot;The Longevity Diet: Discover the New Science to Slow Aging, Fight Disease, and Manage Your Weight&quot; by Dr Valter Longo. In this book, Valter explains how he uses the 5 pillars of longevity to build a diet that has the most potential to be beneficial for longevity, anti-aging and healthspan. So, in this video we will first take a look at the 5 pillars; basic research, epidemiology studies, clinical trials, centenarian studies and models of complex systems, and then look at the diet itself.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: This is me talking about a book I enjoyed reading.
