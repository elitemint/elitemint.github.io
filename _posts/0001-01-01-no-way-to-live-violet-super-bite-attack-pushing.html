The reason that I decide to create these videos because macaques here are facing danger, threats, torture and hunting. The most vulnerable types are those with long-tailed. They are captured for food by the villagers and some are being smuggling to the neighboring counties for brain eating alive and also for experiments in laboratories in USA and Europe. This news has broken my heart so far. This is what I’m worried and pity them the most. Thus, they are in a real need of our help for their continued survival. They face many hardships such as habitat loss, diminishing resources, and drastic changes to regional weather seasons.<br />You’re my channel’s fans, you surely can make a positive differences by sharing what you learn about these monkeys or joining conservations effort to help protect them since at least once a month, we often spot the corpse of a monkey in the forest with the wound on their neck or other places over their body. Seems like they were runnig for life from some abuse or killing. Additionallt, some are also missing. We really do not like to see happen and we will be against those violent actions to these human-like creatures.<br />Anyway, all monkeys have their names and you can follow their daily lives since we will try to video them every day. We will tell you how to recognize each monkey because they all have each significant identification. <br />If you have any ideas about our videos or what you want us to more focus, please kindly comment below.<br />Please note that Channel Monkey Family Cambodia (MFC) has only one channel.<br /><br />Finally, I sincerely request you to subscribe our channel to reach the goal number, so we hope we will be qualified enough to be the animal helper or join with other organizations.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.{% endraw %}
