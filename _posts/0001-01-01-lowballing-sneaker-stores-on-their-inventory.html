We also filmed a skit on Qias's channel where we lowballed the store and did lowballing on customers selling their sneakers in store. We talked about buying a giant pack of Nike Dunk Lows like the Archeo Pink and Georgetown and holding them. We give some great sneaker reselling investment advice that can help you make money and profits. We were able to get some great deals on these shoes, for us to make a good profit on. This really is what goes on in a day in the life of a sneaker business. We also share some sneaker reselling advice. We show you many sneaker unboxings in this video, which also feel like sneaker mystery boxes to us sometimes. We are starting a twitch stream, so make sure to go follow us on that platform! We also share that we will be at Sneaker Con Boston this weekend. Based on how Sneakercon Denver, Sneakercon Dallas, Sneakercon Chicago, Sneaker con San Jose / Bay Area, Sneakercon Atlanta, Kobey's Swap Meet, Boston Got Sole, New York / New Jersey Got Sole and Sneaker con Phoenix went, Sneakercon Fort Lauderdale will be a BANGER. We hope you all enjoy the videos and thank you for the continued support!<br /><br />If you guys are in the Phoenix, Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, Tempe or Scottsdale area in Arizona, come check out our shop located in Tempe!<br /><br />Help me hit 20K followers on Instagram<br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thecommonhype/">https://www.instagram.com/thecommonhype/</a><br />Store IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/commonhypeaz/">https://www.instagram.com/commonhypeaz/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/thecommonhype">https://twitter.com/thecommonhype</a><br />Cook Group: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thegoodchefs/">https://www.instagram.com/thegoodchefs/</a><br /><br />â™ª Music By: LukeXI{% endraw %}
