Key features from the review protocol are recorded and maintained as a permanent record. PROSPERO aims to provide a comprehensive listing of systematic reviews registered at inception to help avoid duplication and reduce opportunity for reporting bias by enabling comparison of the completed review with what was planned in the protocol.<br /><br />PROSPERO is produced by the Centre for Review and Dissemination (CRD) and funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR).{% endraw %}
