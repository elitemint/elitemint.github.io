But what I can say is, that it's the biggest collection with the most amount of exotic armor on Hypixel Skyblock!<br /><br />Anyways thank u so much for watching!  <br /><br />Note: All this armor is exotic armor. Some look like original armor that's because people tried to dye their armor back to the old color.  <br /><br />Have a nice day!{% endraw %}
