{% raw %}Today I have a basic tutorial video: how to sew square gussets using a sewing machine! <br /><br />I often seek out tutorials about one specific technique, and when I couldn't find anything on how to french seam a gusset, I took that as a challenge to figure it out myself!  It took me a couple tries, but once I found the correct order of operations, I knew that someone  else out there would appreciate the info :D<br /><br />Basic Construction starts at 00:42<br /><br />French Seam tutorial starts at 04:53<br /><br />★Follow me! ★<br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/MorganDonner">https://www.patreon.com/MorganDonner</a><br />Etsy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/MorganDonnersParty">https://www.etsy.com/shop/MorganDonnersParty</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MorganDonnersSewing">https://www.facebook.com/MorganDonnersSewing</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/morgandonner/">https://www.instagram.com/morgandonner/</a><br />My (mostly) Costuming blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.MorganDonner.com">http://www.MorganDonner.com</a>{% endraw %}
