{% raw %}The biggest stock market crash ever could be just a few days ago.<br /><br />Over the last few days, the US lawmakers have announced the Unrealized Capital Gains Tax which could lead to this market crash.<br /><br />This new tax should only target billionaires and high earners and will finance the new Social Policy, Climate and Infrastructure bill.<br /><br />The only problem is that the US Government seems to not have thought through the 2021 market crash implications of what they are proposing.<br /><br />Because a tax on unrealized capital gains could have severe implications for the US economy and could lead to a huge market crash in 2021.<br /><br />This worst stock market crash ever would be the worst case scenario or, in a more likely outcome, a massive outflow of billionaires from the US economy.<br /><br />üíµ GREAT INVESTING APPS I USE<br /><br />GET A FREE SHARE WORTH UP TO $150 WITH STAKE (UK, Australia, NZ)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hellostake.pxf.io/qnA3xq">https://hellostake.pxf.io/qnA3xq</a><br />You will get a free share if you sign up using this link and deposit a minimum of ¬£50.<br /><br />GET A FREE SHARE WORTH UP TO ¬£200 WITH FREETRADE (UK ONLY)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://magic.freetrade.io/join/sasha-yanshin">https://magic.freetrade.io/join/sasha-yanshin</a><br />You need to sign up and make any deposit to get the free share.<br /><br />SIGN UP FOR ETORO (Global)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://med.etoro.com/B15358_A95689_TClick_SSasha.aspx">https://med.etoro.com/B15358_A95689_TClick_SSasha.aspx</a><br />67% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider.
