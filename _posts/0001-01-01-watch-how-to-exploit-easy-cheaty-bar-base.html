{% raw %}The Fun Pimps moved forward with starting to NERF shapes based on size, while not nerfing others of the same size due to feeling they were &quot;ok'. In this case, plates, poles and the like had less hp, but bars were specifically excluded despite being smaller, since TFP liked them being used.<br /><br />While TFP un-nerfed it temporarily, the code is in to re-introduce the nerf once they figure out how to handle displaying HP on blocks prior to placing them. We can thus expect this to be part of a point release during Alpha 20.<br /><br />I wanted to show how easy it is to simply use their design and exploit the heck out of it, instead of plates next to each other simply use bars, which have the added peculiarity of hardly ever being targeted by zombies!<br /><br />Moral of the story? Stop nerfing stuff, add features to attract people and if people want to use odd-shapes to exploit, so be it, who cares really? It's their game to play and to ruin. Those of us who doesn't want to exploit won't regardless.<br /><br />Alpha 20 NEWS and UPDATES Full Playlist:🔗  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Z54hiemOAvbB44cASLUyFX7_chOgqLw">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Z54hiemOAvbB44cASLUyFX7_chOgqLw</a><br /><br />7 Days to Die Guide Playlist 🔗 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Z54hiemOAvaGeK8_3lOCst40s5vFYak">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Z54hiemOAvaGeK8_3lOCst40s5vFYak</a><br /><br />Enjoyed it?
