{% raw %}We were told our environmental standards would rise after brexit. An obvious lie because the EU only provided a minimum floor of standards, not a maximum ceiling. Sure enough, the government have voted yet again to lower our standards. In this case, it means allowing the dumping of untreated sewages into our waters rather than admit that brexit has made treating it impossible. No river in Britain is now clean, and our coastline is being shut off to residents.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/adifferentbias">https://www.patreon.com/adifferentbias</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Philmoorhouse76">https://twitter.com/Philmoorhouse76</a>{% endraw %}
