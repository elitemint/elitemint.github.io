{% raw %}Product design workshops are the best way of starting the product development process. We love conducting them in-house with our clients, but sometimes it’s not possible to meet each other in our office. Fortunately, at Merixstudio we run online Product Design workshop sessions, which can bring a lot of benefits for your project.<br />What do the online workshops look like? <br /><br />The core of the remote workshop session is basically the same as in the case of workshops ran in-house. Every session is different and adjusted to the project’s or service’s needs. What they do have in common is that we take special care into selecting the right crew on board. The team is more than happy to take an active part in analyzing the problems as well as generating potential solutions based on our knowledge and experience.<br /><br />To run the online workshop effectively and ensure the best communication and cooperation possible we use different tools like Mural, Google Meets, Google Docs, and others if needed.<br />Before the workshops, we inform the client about the tools we are going to use, so he can prepare for using it during the session. <br /><br />Such workshops are divided into shorter sessions with each one lasting approximately 4 hours. That’s why they are moderated by experienced facilitators that can watch over the most effective course of the workshop. <br /><br />Remote sessions will help you save time, not only because you don’t need to travel to Poland and visit our office. The tools we use contribute to a better work organization, sharing the data and ideas, and effective gathering of project requirements. <br /><br />Here is the list of useful rules when participating in online workshops:<br />Make sure you have a good internet connection - this is a must!<br />Do not interrupt each other - follow “one person speaking at the time” rule<br />Make sure you are on the same page as others - <br />participants know. We want the session to be productive<br />Attention span is lower, so ask for breaks if your focus is limited<br /><br />If you have more questions about remote workshop sessions, contact us, and we’ll dispel all your doubts about them.{% endraw %}
