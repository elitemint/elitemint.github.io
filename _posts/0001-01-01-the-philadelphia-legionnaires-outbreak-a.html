{% raw %}On the 24th of July, 1976, a convention held by the American Legion at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia came to an end. Three days later, all over the state, veterans who had attended the convention started dying. All of them experienced the same symptoms. Many of them, ultimately, had the same fate. It would take months of patient and painstaking investigation before doctors would finally be able to identify the cause of this deadly epidemic.<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:42 - Background<br />01:37 - The Outbreak<br />02:44 - The Investigation<br />07:23 - The Aftermath<br /><br />I tell the true stories behind some of history's greatest disasters... but without sensationalism or disturbing imagery.
