{% raw %}In this episode Saifedean talks to Jack Mallers, CEO of Strike, about how the Lightning Network is disrupting the global payments industry. Jack explains how international remittances work, why they are so costly and why the industry cannot compete with Lightning-based solutions. He and Saifedean then discuss how bitcoin is helping El Salvadorians transition from using cash to using bitcoin, whilst bypassing commercial banks. They also cover Jack’s role in helping to introduce Lightning tips to Twitter and Strike’s new “Pay Me in Bitcoin” application. In the Q&amp;A, Jack takes questions on Strike’s expansion into Europe, who he would most like to “orange pill”, and which countries are likely to make bitcoin legal tender next.<br /><br />0:00 Welcoming Jack Mallers <br />1:45 How does Strike work? <br />6:11 Exchanging Fiat and Bitcoin<br />9:00 Scaling Bitcoin<br />13:00 You decide if you want Bitcoin or Dollars<br />15:30 Transferring value via a digital bearer instrument<br />19:30 Building upon an open network <br />30:00 open vs. centralized networks  <br />26:00 Lightning disrupting traditional companies<br />31:30 Concerns about the Lightning Network<br />40:30 El Salvador adopting Bitcoin <br />50:00 Banking the unbanked<br />50:40 Visa is losing.
