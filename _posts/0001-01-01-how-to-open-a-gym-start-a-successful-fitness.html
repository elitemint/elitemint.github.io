{% raw %}Hey, It's Brett Here (@mrbrettsummers on other ig/tik Tok) and I just wanted to encourage you for one minute.  I'm writing this on April 25th 2021 as I've watch this video pick up traction and had a lot of great responses from it.  Not that you need it, but I want to give you permission to start your gym/fitness business NOW!  Start with humility and don't bury yourself under unnecessary expenses.<br /><br />Keep you expenses low and build your brand by GIVING &amp; SERVING your clients.  Yes, you'll need some creativity, but that extra resourcefulness is exactly what will make things seem easy later on when you've stacked up a ton of dough-dough bird.  <br /><br />If you have more questions, hit me on IG @mrbrettsummers or through my business acct @toplinegym so I can shoot you some quick pointers. <br /><br />I've got nothing to sell you as far as a product. I'm doing this for free because I want to help you, like I wished someone did for me in the beginning.  Love ya'll and get after it.  -Brett <br /><br />Video Breakdown:<br /><br />For starters…I WOULD NOT BUY A GYM…<br /><br />BUT here is what I would do: <br /><br />1.
