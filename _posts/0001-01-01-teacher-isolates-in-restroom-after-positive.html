{% raw %}A Chicago woman isolated herself in a tiny plane bathroom after testing positive for COVID-19 mid-flight. Preschool teacher Marisa Fotieo was flying to Iceland when she started feeling a sore throat and gave herself a rapid test. When she saw the bad news, she voluntarily stayed in the bathroom for four hours. After landing, Fotieo spent a lonely Christmas quarantining in a Reykjavik hotel, and she's still there today. She says staying in the bathroom was “the best thing for [her] anxiety.”{% endraw %}
