{% raw %}In a flexible and autonomous factory, product inquiries by customers will be automatically answered with cost and delivery date. Based on the request, an optimal production plan is scheduled, and production execution is started automatically. The production systems are highly automated and will adapt automatically to the requested product design. This also makes it easy to implement requested customized product features. The material is transported autonomously to the production stations and processed by autonomous machines. These autonomous machines detect their environment through sensor technology and can group into flexible production cells. The duration of individual production and transportation steps is precisely coordinated with the machines and central production planning, thus enabling a constant product flow, even at high-capacity utilization. <br />The following video is intended to show what opportunities this vision offers for us and our customers. Here, self-organizing production is explained using a simple product example: the purchase of a customized bicycle.{% endraw %}
