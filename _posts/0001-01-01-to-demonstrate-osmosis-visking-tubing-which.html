{% raw %}• Visking tubing (which acts as a semi permeable membrane) is soaked in water to make it easier to open.<br />• Two lengths of visking tubing are then cut. One of the tubes is filled with distilled water the other with a sucrose solution. <br />• Both are then tied off and dried, the mass of each is then recorded.<br />• The tubes are then placed in distilled water for 15 mins. Both are removed, dried and the mass is measured and recorded again.<br />Result: Visking tubing with sucrose in it has an increased mass showing osmosis occurred.{% endraw %}
