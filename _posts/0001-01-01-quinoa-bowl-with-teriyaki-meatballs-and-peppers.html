{% raw %}This ultra-quick, ultra-versatile dish is begging to be added to your arsenal.  Customize the protein, starch, sauces and sides to your hearts desire.  Or make it just like this (hint: it's delightful).  And of course, only your pantry, 5 ingredients and 25 minutes are required.<br /><br />Quinoa Bowl with Teriyaki Meatballs and Peppers<br />Five in 25<br /><br />Five Ingredients<br />Frozen Pre-cooked Meatballs<br />Teriyaki Sauce<br />16 oz Brussels Sprouts<br />2 Bell Peppers<br />1 Cup Quinoa (uncooked)<br />From the Pantry<br />Olive Oil<br />Red Wine Vinegar<br /><br />Cook the quinoa per package directions.  Heat up as many meatballs as desired.<br /><br />Slice the bell peppers into strips.  Cut the woody stem end off the sprouts and shave them thinly from end to end.  Use a food processor or mandolin if desired. <br /><br />Heat 1 T of olive oil over medium high heat in a non-stick skillet and add the peppers.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cook, tossing occasionally for 5-7 minutes until tender and slightly charred.  Set aside.  Add more oil and add the shaved sprouts.  Season with salt and pepper and cook, tossing every minute or two for 5-7 minutes or until wilted and a few leaves have taken on a dark, charred color.  Finally add a splash (1 T) of red wine vinegar and toss to combine.  Set aside.<br /><br />Toss warm meatballs with teriyaki sauce.<br /><br />Line the bottom of a wide bowl with quinoa.  Add a row or two of meatballs down the center.  Line one side with the peppers and the other with the warm sprout salad.  Optionally garnish with sliced scallions and/or sesame seeds.<br /><br />This is a template but can be altered in so many ways – swap the peppers for onions, the quinoa for rice, the meatballs for vegan options, and the sauce for barbecue or buffalo sauce!  Your plate is limited only by your imaginations and – in our case – 25 minutes.{% endraw %}
