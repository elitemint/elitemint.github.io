{% raw %}Christian Medical College Vellore (CMC) and the United States-based Vellore CMC Foundation partnered, in 2012, to establish the Dr. Ida S. Scudder Humanitarian Oration to perpetuate the legacy of CMC's founder, Dr. Ida Sophia Scudder. By honouring exceptional individuals who exemplify her compassion, integrity and character, the Oration seeks to inspire others to emulate her dedication to the service of humanity.<br /><br />On this, the 10th anniversary of the Dr. Ida S. Scudder Humanitarian Oration, we are delighted to honour Mr. Azim Premji. Two characteristics define Mr. Premji - passionate altruism and limitless philanthropy. By embracing humanity, living selflessly and consciously being a committed steward of his wealth, Mr. Premji has shown that these are values that everyone can live by. These qualities, as well as his personal austerity, humility and simplicity make him an excellent role model for all Indians.<br /><br />In recognition of Mr. Azim Premjiâ€™s unsurpassable benevolence and his steadfast commitment to creating an India with equity, he is eminently worthy to be linked with the name of our beloved founder, through the award of the 2021 Dr. Ida S. Scudder Humanitarian Oration.{% endraw %}
