Instead of the usual build guide I dive deep into all of the details of the most popular equipment choices for the team builds, like the one that's currently really popular is Reverse Melt Rosaria and how it works in the latest 2.3 Abyss or how about Tazer Kokomi who also has a really cool usage for Freeze team in Genshin Impact.<br /><br />If you're ever in doubt what's the 2.3 team build in Genshin Impact, you literally just have to look at what teams others are building and hopefully get some inspiration to make your very own team!<br /><br />Genshin Impact is an open-world gacha game that's available on PC, PS4, PS5 and mobile devices (iOS &amp; Android). Genshin Impact features fast gameplay with best RPG elements in an action packed setting.<br /><br />Music:<br />Genshin Impact<br /><br />Footage:<br />All footage produced by Gacha Gamer.<br /><br />We are in no way affiliated to the developers or publishers of the mentioned games.
