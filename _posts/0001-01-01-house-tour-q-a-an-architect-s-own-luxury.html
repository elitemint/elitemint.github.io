{% raw %}Home Owner &amp; Architect shares her unique concept, materials and design process<br />READ MORE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.huntingforgeorge.com/blog/am-houses-let-us-in-home-tour/">https://www.huntingforgeorge.com/blog/am-houses-let-us-in-home-tour/</a><br /><br />Those that followed our 'On the Road' journey along the East Coast of Australia would have joined us on our visit to the A+M Houses in Sydney's exclusive Fairlight. Home to architect Vivian Marston of Marston Architects, the design concept for this home explores a small living ethos in order to maximise every inch of this three bedroom townhouse. Meeting and chatting with Viv was an absolute treat, her knowledge and experience from her 40 year career in architecture is evident however it was her passion for the design concept and process that left me truly inspired. I hope you enjoy this intimate House Tour and Q&amp;A with Vivian Marston as much as I did.
