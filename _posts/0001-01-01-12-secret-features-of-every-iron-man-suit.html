{% raw %}Super Hero suits are half the fun of comic book movies. There’s nothing like witnessing the heroes' journey play out as a costumed vigilante slowly upgrades their suit as they become the Marvel legend that we know them to be. No one hero in the entirety of the Marvel Cinematic Universe can escape the never-ending list of new costumes. Take Spider-Man: No Way Home for example. In just one movie we see Peter Parker go through the Far From Home suit, the Black and Gold suit, the Iron Spider suit, the Integrated costume, and the classic costume. Speaking of Spidey, stay tuned to the end of this video true believers! We discuss how Tony’s ingenious helped the wall-crawler in a fight against Doc Ock.<br /><br />This intense fashion sense trend started way back at the beginning of the MCU with good old Tony Stark. Through his never-ending quest of trying to wrap a suit of armor, all around the world- we see a plethora of unique tin suits which all feature an awe-inspiring amount of hidden features perfect for really any situation. From suits that can take on super soldiers like Captain America and The Winter Soldier to gamma-infused beasts like The Incredible Hulk.<br /><br />Before the days of the Mark 85 where Tony could conjure anything through Nanotech, came a whole period of research and development. Countless suits were created specifically to troubleshoot a certain ability. Take for instance the Starboost armor which allowed for safe travels throughout space, which no doubt came in handy when Stark was facing off against Thanos with the Guardians Of The Galaxy on Titan in Avengers Infinity War. Do you ever wonder how Tony Stark is able to make a Tony stank in his suit? We even answer that one!<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant">http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant</a><br /><br />Chapters:<br />0:00 - Intro <br />0:36 - Pacemaker - Mark I<br />0:56 - Gotta go fast! - Mark II<br />1:52 - Environmental resistance - Mark III<br />2:27 - Jarvis, change my diaper - Mark IV<br />3:20 - Unlimited power - Mark VI<br />4:08 - Thrust me - Mark VII<br />4:52 - The Iron Legion<br />5:40 - Built into his bones - Extremis / Mark XLII<br />6:27 - Multiple Arc reactors - Hulkbuster armor<br />7:17 - Peek a Boo Cap! - Mark XLVI<br />8:48 - Rocketman - Mark L<br />9:30 - Foreign Object Integration - Mark 85<br /><br />Check out Screen Rant’s official TikTok! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@screenrant">https://www.tiktok.com/@screenrant</a> <br /><br />Our Social Media:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/screenrant">https://twitter.com/screenrant</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant">https://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant</a>  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/screen-rant/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/screen-rant/</a> <br /><br />Our Website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://screenrant.com/">http://screenrant.com/</a><br /><br />Video By: Julian Dufresne<br /><br />For copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com{% endraw %}
