{% raw %}Have a Volkswagen? You'll almost definitely have at least ONE of these problems. These three problems are quite weird ones, but they happen on almost all Volkswagen makes and models that were made in the last 20 or more years. I've had 4 VWs, and each of these problems has happened with at least two of them, and my friends have had the same issues with their car. These are not isolated to one specific model, and affect the Golf, Jetta, GTI, Passat, Tiguan, and many, many more.<br /><br />This list of problems is as follows:<br />Volkswagen Mirror Flap<br />Coil Spring Failure, both front and rear<br />Electronic issues, specifically power windows and door locks<br /><br />Support CashedOutCars on Patreon, and get exclusive benefits!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/CashedOutCars">https://www.patreon.com/CashedOutCars</a><br /><br />For write ups, tech articles, and more, check out my website!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cashedoutcars.com">https://www.cashedoutcars.com</a><br /><br />End Screen Music: 3mbrace - Issues <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spoti.fi/3hpG1b0">https://spoti.fi/3hpG1b0</a><br /><br />*All links are affiliate links, purchasing through them means a small portion of the total cost goes towards supporting the channel, and there's NO additional cost to you!{% endraw %}
