Your All Purpose flour may be different than what's available in the US. If in doubt, choose a flour that has between 11-12% protein and you should be in good shape! <br /><br />ALSO if you have never made bread before, this dough is 78% hydration and will be slightly sicky. Use 75 less grams water in the final dough and it will be much easier to handle. <br /><br />PREFERMENT (POOLISH)  <br /><br />150g or ROUGHLY 1 C. AP FLOUR <br />150g or ROUGHLY 2/3C.
