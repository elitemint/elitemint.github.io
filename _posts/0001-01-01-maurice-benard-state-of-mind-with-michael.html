{% raw %}This week I'm joined by Michael Sutton. You may know Michael best from his role as Stone Cates on General Hospital.<br /><br />Michael was the first actor I ever worked with at General Hospital. We had a pretty immediate connection and he really became like my little brother. Michael got me through some very very tough times during those first few weeks and it was really interesting for me to get his perspective on it.<br /><br />We also talk about the AIDS storyline, one of the most important storylines in soap history, and the impact that it had.<br /><br />Since then Michael went on to be one of the best in nightclub promotion, a successful restaurateur and is now killing it as a luxury real estate agent. I am so proud of who he was and who he is now.<br /><br />National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 800-273-8255 (available 24 hours)<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mauricebenard/">https://www.instagram.com/mauricebenard/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mauricebenard">https://twitter.com/mauricebenard</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MauriceBenard/">https://www.facebook.com/MauriceBenard/</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mbstateofmind/">https://www.instagram.com/mbstateofmind/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mbstateofmind">https://twitter.com/mbstateofmind</a><br />Learn more about State Of Mind at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mbstateofmind.com.">https://www.mbstateofmind.com.</a><br /><br />If you'd like to learn more about my life, I've recently released &quot;Nothing General About It - How Love (and Lithium) Saved Me On and Off General Hospital&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062973371?tag=harpercollinsus-20">https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062973371?tag=harpercollinsus-20</a>{% endraw %}
