We had an AWESOME time.  The Monday following the festival we got to check out an awesome trail near PHX.  Thanks to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.arabellahotelsedona.com/">https://www.arabellahotelsedona.com/</a> for providing the BEST place to stay in town.<br />Sunset Ridge, aka &quot;Kirby's Khaos&quot; is a 1.5 mile long, hand cut labor of love. The trail was built to raise the level of difficulty and technicality of the Hawes Trail System. It has numerous steep sections, chutes, rock gardens, slabs, rock rollers, drops and booters, with some exposure. The trail is loose and fast, with a short, technical climb about half-way down. Keep an eye out for all the bonus lines Ride with caution.<br /><br />Sunset Ridge can be accessed from both the West (by climbing Cactus Garden) and the East (by climbing L'Alpe d'Huez to Goat) sides of the Hawes trail system. For an extended, rowdy DH experience, connect to the Mine Trial descent at the end of your Sunset Ridge ride.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.trailforks.com/trails/sunset-ridge-240755/">https://www.trailforks.com/trails/sunset-ridge-240755/</a>{% endraw %}
