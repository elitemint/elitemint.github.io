{% raw %}Here's a quick guide to making sourdough.<br /><br />Quick recipe:<br />260-300g water<br />100g starter yeast<br />1 tbsp salt<br />470-500g bread flour<br /><br />Mix water and starter into a kneading bowl well. Let it settle for 5 mins. <br />Add Salt to the mixture followed by bread flour.<br />Mix and knead into a ball.<br />You can transfer onto a table dusted with flour  which may be easier.<br />Using both hands, cup and form the dough into a ball, by pulling the dough downwards to fold into the bottom. This stretches the dough to form a tight ball. <br /><br />Once done, cover the dough for 45mins to an hour to let it proof.<br />At 45min mark, the dough should have risen a little. Pull it lengthwise and fold back towards the middle, one side at a time. Repeat with the other direction. You can repeat this again to finally form the dough back into a ball again. Cover for another 45 mins. Repeat this folding 1-2 more times.<br /><br />After the last folding, the dough should have now increased in size. Once it has doubled in volume, prepare a basket banneton. Sprinkle rice flour over the banneton, and using a scraper tool, lift up the dough, transfer into your hands, and invert it before placing the dough into the basket. <br /><br />Cover the dough lightly and let it rise until the dough has full risen to the top of basket.<br /><br />Dough is ready for baking. Transfer the dough into a cast iron pan. Make slits to make patterns as you wish. Cover the dough with another cast iron pan or dutch iron pan with sufficient room for dough to rise.<br /><br />Bake at 230-250C for 30mins, and then remove top cover and bake for another 20mins at 200C.<br /><br />Once baking is done, let it cool and enjoy!!{% endraw %}
