I'll never change. I'm an evergreen tree.<br />A brother and a son. Nothing I did to be called a loved one.<br /> <br />In my Sunday's best, I tried to sing with my soul.<br />Desperately trying to fill this hole in my chest.<br />A puddle of sweat where I can see myself.<br />I know there's no time to pretend to be something else.<br /> <br />My life is caught up in these feet and eyes.<br />My heart beats to find the tune to these distant skies.<br /><br />No seasons for me. I'm the middle C.<br />Evergreen. No dissonance, just clean. No seasons for me.<br /> <br />Carry On Kid.<br /> <br />A masterpiece which I just call a mess.<br />I look ahead to respect the process.<br />You live. You learn. You reap what you sow.<br />I'll plant my roots. I'll Stay and I'll Grow.{% endraw %}
