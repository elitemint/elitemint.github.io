It is indeed terrifying, but at the same time fascinating to see these prehistoric creatures at work, with their viciousness and hunting prowess in full display.<br />So disturbing as they are to watch, I figured you’d find some morbid enjoyment our collection of clips today. From someone almost getting his head bit of to a croc biting off more than it could chew, here are 10 of the scariest crocodile attacks caught on camera.<br /><br />Number 10. Jaws Meet Head<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/DPoWp4OxNo4">https://youtu.be/DPoWp4OxNo4</a><br />If you like danger but don’t like to take part in any dangerous activity yourself, one of the best things you can do is watch crocodile shows in zoos. Thailand is the perfect destination for them and these shows feature many of these vicious reptiles interacting with zoo keepers in various dangerous situations, most of which are brought about by the zoo keepers themselves. <br />These brave people get into crocodile enclosures where they get up close and persona with these giant reptiles, often feeding them, wrangling them, and sometimes, even kissing them on the snout, always in front of an astonished, often terrified crowd. Most of the time, shows like these end safely. Zoo keepers are always careful around these animals, fully knowing how unpredictable they can be. But sometimes they get too overconfident which leads to disastrous results.<br />This particular zoo keeper just had to stick his head inside the gaping jaws of crocs mouth. Usually, he would put a couple of sticks in there to wedge the crocs mouth open, but this time, he either forgot to or was confident that the croc wouldn’t shut his jaws closed. Big mistake. <br />The big croc did shut its mouth, and not only that, swung its head from side to side, trying to rip the poor man’s head off of his shoulders. Don’t worry, help arrived soon enough, making sure the man walked away with his head, but something tells me he won’t be putting his head inside any croc’s head anytime soon.<br /><br />Number 9. Caught in a Death Roll<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZhHHVsAnI4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZhHHVsAnI4</a><br />All pro wrestlers have a finishing move, you know, that move that they make that usually results in a three count. Now, if crocodiles were pro wrestlers, their finishers would definitely be the infamous death roll. The move entails the crocodile’s jaws clamping onto a body part, usually one of the extremities, and then rolling around until whatever is in its mouth get ripped off. They do this just in case they brought down a prey that is too big for them to swallow whole, allowing them to tear out huge, but more manageable chunks.<br />I’m pretty sure you can imagine how gory a scene that is, so if you’re in one of those crocodile shows, it’s not something you want to see up close and personal. But that what the audience of this particular crocodile show witnessed.<br />Fortunately, it wasn’t a head that was in the croc’s mouth this time, but rather an arm, but that doesn’t make the scene more palatable to the senses. To cut the long story short, the man’s arm was broken, but even so, admitted that he was lucky to be alive.<br /><br />Number 8. Painful Photo Op<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q36bCQ0NZtE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q36bCQ0NZtE</a><br />There is a very safe way to handle crocodiles. The safest way is to never actually touch them at all, but if you really have to, better make sure that you listen to experts. Like the experts that run the Ave Dapke crocodile farm, a place where people can actually interact with crocodiles living in their natural environment.<br />Most of these crocs are used to human presence and are regularly fed, which makes sure that guests who visit the place are in relative safety, despite the close proximity of the animals to humans. Employees there are so confident that no one is going to be attacked that they even allow tourists to take photos with the crocs. And normally, that’s the case. Not this day however.<br />The woman in orange made the mistake of touching the croc on its side; one place you should never touch an already irritated croc. In a split second, the croc chomped at the woman’s hand, sending the watching crowd into a panic. And although the video didn’t show what actually happened, we can infer from the squeals of terror that it definitely wasn’t good.{% endraw %}
