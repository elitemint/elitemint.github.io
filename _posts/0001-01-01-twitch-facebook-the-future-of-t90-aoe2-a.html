{% raw %}A few days back I made an announcement which was a big shock for many people around the AoE2 scene. I will no longer be streaming on Twitch and have moved to Facebook Gaming. I'm very excited and positive about the future, but this caused a lot of shock. So I wanted to sit down and talk to you guys on a more personal level now that things have settled down a bit and give some thoughts. I'm dedicated to the content on streams and videos going forward and want to continue to grow the game. Hope y'all benefit from listening in some capacity and are excited for the things to come. Whether it's on Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, or Myspace. I'll be working hard for y'all. Above all else, thanks!  <br /><br />Livestream ➤ fb.gg/T90Official<br />Merch ➤ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/t90officials-store">https://teespring.com/stores/t90officials-store</a><br />Patreon ➤ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/T90Official">https://www.patreon.com/T90Official</a><br />Twitter ➤ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/t90official">https://twitter.com/t90official</a><br />Facebook ➤ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/T90Official">https://www.facebook.com/T90Official</a><br />Donate ➤ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2z4T4rm">http://bit.ly/2z4T4rm</a><br /><br />This video was created under Microsoft's &quot;Game Content Usage Rules&quot; using assets from Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, © Microsoft Corporation.{% endraw %}
