{% raw %}Umi Uzi's best cartoon car friend Broom teaches your kids the various street vehicles in scary form that they learn about in preschool or see on the roads. These various modes of transport are illustrated and their uses shown so that children learn whilst having fun with their favorite cartoons!<br />We have a nursery rhyme, song , video or game for every occasion here at Umi Uzi. With home to many cartoon 2D and 3D characters we are a preschoolers best friend. A school away from school we make our videos not just to please the toddler but also to educate him/her with new concepts, skills and ideas. We take kindergarten a step further with in depth understanding of a preschoolers comprehension, cognitive development, motor skills, language acquisition,  executive functions, self concept, identity development and moral values.{% endraw %}
