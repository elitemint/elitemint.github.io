{% raw %}Step inside the pitch meeting that led to Marvel’s Eternals!<br /><br />Subscribe for more Pitch Meetings: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6">http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6</a><br /><br />After Avengers Endgame, Marvel has the massive task of not only continuing their surviving heroes' stories, but also making audiences care about all new characters and all-new universe-threatening events. Their latest movie Eternals takes on the gargantuan challenge of introducing ten new superheroes AND explaining why they’re only showing up now. This thing’s getting complicated.<br /><br />Eternals definitely raises some questions. Like should this have been a Disney Plus show? Why do the Eternals only have important conversations at Golden Hour? Why is introducing humans to weapons not considered interfering in their affairs? Wouldn’t the Celestials be interested in stopping Thanos if they need a massive population to birth celestials? Why didn’t Kumail have a shirtless scene after all that work!? What have these post-credit scenes become?!<br /><br />To answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to Eternals! It’ll be super easy, barely an inconvenience.<br /><br />Check Out These Other Amazing Videos:<br /><br />Shang-Chi Pitch Meeting<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIFIZ5V_o2I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIFIZ5V_o2I</a><br /><br />Every Marvel Pitch Meeting In Order Of The MCU Timeline<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTnqwa2tiV0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTnqwa2tiV0</a><br /><br />Our Social Media:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/screenrant">https://twitter.com/screenrant</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant">https://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant</a><br /><br />Our Website<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://screenrant.com/">http://screenrant.com/</a>{% endraw %}
