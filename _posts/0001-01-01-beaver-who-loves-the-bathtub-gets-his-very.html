{% raw %}This wildlife rehabber welcomed a baby beaver into her home. He loved building dams in her house and swimming in her bathtub. When some pond builders got wind of his story, they offered to build him his very own pond. Watch him dive in his new pond for the first time!<br /><br />To help save more animals like JB, you can support Second Chances Wildlife here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thedo.do/donatesecondchances,">http://thedo.do/donatesecondchances,</a> and check them out on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thedo.do/secondchanceswildlife.">http://thedo.do/secondchanceswildlife.</a><br />Additional thanks to Greg Wittstock and the Aquascape team for helping build JB's pond, you can check him out on YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thedo.do/thepondguy.">http://thedo.do/thepondguy.</a><br /><br />Introducing Dodo swag!  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.thedodo.com/">https://shop.thedodo.com/</a><br /><br />Love Animals?
