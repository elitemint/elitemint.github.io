{% raw %}Sometimes a client can 'challenge' our therapeutic objectivity. Take Kathleen, for example. <br />Kathleen was a client of mine who I felt had been indoctrinated through a series of 'Awaken' workshops over the previous year, and as a result she had left her loving husband and three young children. <br /><br />As you might imagine, I found myself struggling with the idea of trying to help Kathleen rise above what seemed to me to be justified anger over this from family members and friends.<br /><br />So in this video I share 3 tips (starting from 7:21) from my observations as to how we can work effectively with therapy clients, even though they might challenge your own assumptions and values.<br /><br />If you found this video helpful then please leave comment and hit the 'like' button - and don't forget to subscribe for future videos.<br /><br />All notes and references can be found on the original article over on the blog:<br />▶︎<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.unk.com/blog/should-you-ever-pass-judgement-on-your-clients?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=social&amp;utm_content=should-you-pass-judgement-on-your-clients&amp;lp-source=YoutubeJudgementClients&amp;utm_term=references">https://www.unk.com/blog/should-you-ever-pass-judgement-on-your-clients?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=social&amp;utm_content=should-you-pass-judgement-on-your-clients&amp;lp-source=YoutubeJudgementClients&amp;utm_term=references</a><br /><br />Therapist?: Join thousands of other Uncommon Practitioners who receive my Clear Thinking newsletter in their inbox every week:<br />▶︎<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.unk.com/blog/free-therapy-techniques/?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=social&amp;utm_content=should-you-pass-judgement-on-your-clients&amp;lp-source=YoutubeJudgementClients&amp;utm_term=newsletter">https://www.unk.com/blog/free-therapy-techniques/?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=social&amp;utm_content=should-you-pass-judgement-on-your-clients&amp;lp-source=YoutubeJudgementClients&amp;utm_term=newsletter</a><br />---------------------------------------<br /><br />++About Mark Tyrrell++<br /><br />Psychology is my passion.
