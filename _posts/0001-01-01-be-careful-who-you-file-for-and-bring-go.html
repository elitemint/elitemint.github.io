{% raw %}This Jamaican woman went back to Jamaica to get her husband, married him, filed immigration papers and made sure he was ok in the USA and that turned out to be the biggest mistake she ever made. In this video we talk about using caution when filing for anyone to come live over seas with you, the importance of judging character to prevent future troubles and what can happen if things go wrong.  This is mainly a update to the case as we await a trial and a sentencing.
