{% raw %}From their debut in 1974 until 1998, Greeceâ€™s Eurovision entries were primarily big Greek ballads sung by big Greek superstars. <br /><br />The turn of the century galvanised the Greeks, and after a brief stint away from the Contest they returned with a bang in 2001. Antique, one of Greeceâ€™s biggest acts at the time, blended traditional Greek sounds with modern pop on their summer anthem (I Would) Die For You and gave Greece their first bronze medal in Copenhagen.<br /><br />The return of Helena Paparizou in 2005, this time as a soloist, gifted Greece what theyâ€™d long been looking for as she proved to be Europeâ€™s number one.<br /><br />-<br />The Eurovision Song Contest celebrates diversity through music.
