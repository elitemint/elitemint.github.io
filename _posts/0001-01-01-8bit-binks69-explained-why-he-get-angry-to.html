{% raw %}With over 175k subscribers, Binks69, also known as Blinks, is one of India's most prominent Valorant content creators. He is also closely associated with content media house 8bit and S8UL Esports.<br /><br />His recent action of dialing up a player post-match and then abusing him, going so far as asking for their location with an implied intent to harm, has left the Valorant community speechless.<br /><br />After an unsatisfactory match, Binks dialed up a fellow player and then abused him for being AFK. Previously, Binks ran into hot water when he tried to teach Singaporean professional player Danial “RedKoh” Hakim to use Sage Wall.<br /><br />It should be clarified that the livestream only showcased one side of the conversation. It is unknown what the other player might have said, but it should not be an excuse for an established streamer to act in an abusive manner. Many younger players look up to pro players as role models.<br /><br />During the conversation, Binks asked for the player’s location, mentioning that he had already found a phone number and wouldn’t take much longer to find the location. While disagreeing on the outcome of a match is quite reasonable, the threat of violent action that followed has created stirs. No one expected this professional player to misbehave and drop to a low.<br /><br />This incident also parallels a previous incident involving a well-known esports caster Mannu “kRaT” Karki, where he dug up a player's personal information during a disagreement over a CS: GO match. He then went on to threaten the player and his family.<br /><br />Binks explains in the video that he had always been against toxicity and tried to be on the right side by controlling the situation. However, as a normal human being, everyone has their own limits, and wrong things might happen because of that.<br /><br />Binks admitted that whatever he did on the stream happened in the “heat of the moment” and that he took some wrong steps during it. The Indian streamer also opened up about the fact that he got some verbal treatment from the other side that actually triggered him.<br /><br />For his mistake on stream, the streamer apologized to his fans and other parties who have felt downhearted by his behavior. Furthermore, Binks also stated that he would be trying his best to avoid such conduct on his streams.<br /><br />Binks extended his apology by mentioning the entire Valorant and gaming community as a whole. He also clarified that it was not scripted because he is not the type of person who would do so.<br /><br />Binks livestream - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/np-SWmofmvw">https://youtu.be/np-SWmofmvw</a><br /><br /><br />My second channel - <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCewBZNMJOn7bnhFsHH4CShA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCewBZNMJOn7bnhFsHH4CShA</a><br /><br />Sponsored By - <br />Extra0rdinnary is sponsored by GemWire - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gemwire.gg/">https://www.instagram.com/gemwire.gg/</a><br /><br />BECOME CHANNEL MEMBERS - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJLFsRmpJtYMvEjoxgl0fEw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJLFsRmpJtYMvEjoxgl0fEw/join</a><br /><br />Contact And Follow me on -   <br /><br />Follow me on Instagram  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/extra_0rdinnary/">https://www.instagram.com/extra_0rdinnary/</a><br />Follow me on Facebook  - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Extraordinary997">https://www.facebook.com/Extraordinary997</a><br />Follow me on Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/EoOfficial99">https://twitter.com/EoOfficial99</a><br />My DISCORD - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/X8fFZYg">https://discord.gg/X8fFZYg</a><br />You Can Send Me News on Instagram. <br /><br />About My channel -<br /><br />Extra0rdinnary is an esports and gaming news platform that puts a focus on pro players, teams, creators, and the games that make it all possible. <br /><br />DISCLAIMER -<br />If you need a song removed on my channel, please message me on Instagram . <br />© Copyright: We / I do not own any of the material in this video.<br />I upload videos for promotional and preview purposes only!<br />If you are the Producer or Photographer and would like the Video taken down please Email me and we / I shall remove it immediately.<br />Please do not issue a &quot;Copyright Strike&quot; against the Channel as it affects all previous work.
