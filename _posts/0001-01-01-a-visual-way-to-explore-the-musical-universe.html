{% raw %}For more information on Kwinten Crauwels, please visit our website www.tedxmuenchen.de<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Already at a young age, Kwinten was extremely interested in the diversity of music and had always regarded music as the highest form of art, capable of dealing the strongest emotions. Besides his profession as an architect, he is highly passionate about creating and designing, particularly large and long-lasting projects. Musicmap is by far the biggest and most challenging of these projects so far. In dire search of the perfect overview of music genres, whilst motivated by the need of those around him for such a thing, Kwinten tried to assemble a framework of genres that balances accuracy, comprehensibility and accessibility. Together with his technically oriented brother and a number of enthusiasts, he spent almost eight years developing a satisfactory map and interactive encyclopedia of popular music genres. <br /><br /><br /><br />Twitter: @_musicmap<br /><br /><br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
