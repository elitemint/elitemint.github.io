Corinthia, who has experience with living on food stamps, believes in saving rather than spending. If Eric has money, he lives by the thought that it's always going to come back. He will spend it on what he wants, when he wants, and there is no limit on what he will spend on Corinthia. The two discuss their differences and how they help each other balance their extremes. <br /><br />We'd like to thank Eric and Corinthia for participating openly &amp; vulnerably in our project. We appreciate what they've shared with us and hope you do as well.<br /><br />Get you digital dose of humanity by signing up for our newsletter and joining our community: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.theskindeep.com/subscribe">http://www.theskindeep.com/subscribe</a><br /><br />The Skin Deep | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.theskindeep.com">http://www.theskindeep.com</a><br />Shop The Skin Deep Products | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.theskindeep.com/">https://shop.theskindeep.com/</a><br />Youtube | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/theskindeep">https://www.youtube.com/theskindeep</a><br />Instagram | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/the_skindeep">http://instagram.com/the_skindeep</a><br />Facebook | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheSkinDeep">https://www.facebook.com/TheSkinDeep</a><br />Twitter | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/the_skindeep">http://twitter.com/the_skindeep</a><br />Pinterest | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/theskindeep/_shop/">https://www.pinterest.com/theskindeep/_shop/</a><br />US Illuminated Podcast | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.theskindeep.com/podcast/usilluminated">https://www.theskindeep.com/podcast/usilluminated</a><br /><br />EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR | Topaz Adizes<br />DIRECTOR | Ashika Kuruvilla<br />CAMERAS | Nick D'Agostino, Ashika Kuruvilla, Dane Benko<br />AUDIO | Jesse Stormo<br />PRODUCER | Nick D'Agostino, Sydney Laws<br />ASSOCIATE PRODUCER | Alison Goerke<br />SPECIAL THANKS | Redline Studios<br />WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF | Eric and Corinthia<br /><br />Sometimes I Just Gotta Let You Have Your Way | {THE AND} Eric &amp; Corinthia<br />#ShareHumanity #BlindDate{% endraw %}
