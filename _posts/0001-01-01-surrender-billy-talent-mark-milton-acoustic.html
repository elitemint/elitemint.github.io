{% raw %}Since we finished with Cancer relatively quickly, we decided to see if there were any other songs we both knew and how many we could get through and record in one evening!<br />Surrender was our next choice since it was both a Billy Talent song (therefore Mark already knew it by heart, no question) and  a sufficiently old one (so that Milton would be somewhat familiar with the tune through years of unintentional exposure).<br />No explosions or slow-mo in this video, but we do have Mark singing for the first time on camera and simultaneously playing guitar no less!{% endraw %}
