{% raw %}Great for showing to the class as a read along!   Have students follow along in their books while teacher Mrs. Morris does an engaging read of &quot;The Fun They Had&quot; from the Journey's series, fourth grade lesson 25.  Also great for students to study with at home, or if you don't have enough reading books for every student!<br /><br />The intentions of this channel are to help teachers encourage reading by giving their students access to a variety of books. All videos are suitable to be shown in a classroom.<br /><br />Donate to my classroom and channel:  www.paypal.me/MrsMorrisReads{% endraw %}
