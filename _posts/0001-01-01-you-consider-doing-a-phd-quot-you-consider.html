{% raw %}&quot;You consider doing a PhD? You should not take this decision light-heartedly! The reason is because doing a PhD is a defining moment in your academic Career and it is a personal transformation. This transition leads you from being simply a student to becoming a creative critical and autonomous thinker. When you're done with your PhD we expect you to take us to the next level and to create new knowledge. If you're ready for this transformation I strongly recommend the University of Vienna! We are a highly reputed research intensive University, we have modern infrastructure and we provide an intellectually inspiring environment. Our new Doctoral Schools provide support in many respects to make sure you can carry out research at the highest international level!&quot; (Jean-Robert Tyran, Vice-Rector of Research and International Affairs, University of Vienna).
