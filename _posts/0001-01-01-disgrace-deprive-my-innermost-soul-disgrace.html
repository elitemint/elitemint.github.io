{% raw %}Disgrace ( founded '87 ) was one of the oldest death metal bands from Finland and pretty much started the Finnish death metal scene together with local band Xysma. Band recorded two demos 1990 which were titled &quot;Beyond The Immortalized Existence&quot; and &quot;Inside the Labyrinth of Depression&quot;. Next year (1991) the signed in Seraphic Decay in America and recorded &quot;Debts of Gods&quot; EP.<br /><br />The band finally recorded their first<br /><br />LP ,&quot;Grey Misery&quot; in 92', after two demos and one EP. After Grey Misery bands style changed to more punk rock oriented style, in which they have remained till this far. Disgrace's musical and lyrical themes were pretty independent from the mainstream DM going on. Lyrical themes dealt with obscure and depressive themes in a phantasy coloured worlds with lots of symbolism involved. Musically they remained pretty surprising; progressive and swinging, by still not forgetting the DM riffs and melody. <br /><br /><br /><br />This is the third track from their &quot;Debts of Gods&quot; EP 1991.{% endraw %}
