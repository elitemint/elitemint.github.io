{% raw %}Guys, did you know that Sue has a recipe for monsters? No? Then welcome to our culinary workshop, we are going to create something unique and delicious today!<br /><br />First of all, we need flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and sour cream, water, vanilla extract, egg, and vegetable oil for the sponge cake. The mixer will help to smooth the mixture! Then we pour the mixture into a mold and send it to the oven! You will see the number of ingredients in our video! <br /><br />Then we take butter, icing sugar, heavy cream, a little salt, and vanilla to make the frosting. Beat the cream with a mixer and divide it into three containers. Add some food coloring to make the mixture colorful!<br /><br />The next step is to cover the sponge cakes with the frosting. Each tier is a different bright color! Also we will make fur from frosting using a pastry bag, and then stick funny faces on each tier! Guys, do you like this funny creamy monster fur? It looks very realistic! And monstrously funny! See for yourself by watching our amazing new recipe!
