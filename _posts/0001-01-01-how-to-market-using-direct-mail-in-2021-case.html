{% raw %}Today we're going to look at a direct mail case study and learn a little more about how to market using direct mail.<br /><br />Traditional &quot;direct mail&quot; is far from dead. In fact, with email and online marketing becoming more popular we get less and less direct mail in our mailboxes. <br /><br />That means there's less competition than ever to grab your audiences attention. <br /><br />Today's case study comes from Leo Hamel Jewlers. Leo is a good friend of mine and a very successful business owner. Not to mention an incredible marketer. <br /><br />He's been using direct mail since he got started nearly 3 decades ago and we can learn a lot from him. <br /><br />Don't forget to subscribe to the channel. <br /><br />Visit my website: www.jasonstapleton.com<br />Link to the USPS Direct Mail Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://eddm.usps.com/eddm/customer/routeSearch.action">https://eddm.usps.com/eddm/customer/routeSearch.action</a><br /><br />And if you want to give your business an unfair advance then subscribe to my marketing newsletter at www.dailyalchemy.me{% endraw %}
