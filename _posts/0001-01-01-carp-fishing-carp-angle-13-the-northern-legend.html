{% raw %}For the main feature on Episode 13 of Carp Angle we spend 48 hours with one of the biggest characters in the world of carp fishing, Frank Warwick. <br />Frank has had a fascinating life, he’s like a human encyclopaedia and his stories are simply second to none… aside from that he’s also an extremely successful carp angler with a wealth of experience and knowledge and so for us it was an absolute pleasure to spend a few days with him. <br /><br />Joe Bloggs is back continuing his spring camping on the mighty St Ives complex and you can also expect a variety of stories from the likes of Alan Blair, Ash Bradbury &amp; Mark Jackson. <br /><br />Sit back and enjoy the show!<br /><br />Episode Chapters:<br />00:00:00 - Frank Warick<br />01:18:53 - Thinking Outside The Tackle Box - Alan Blair<br />01:25:57 - Joe Bloggs Pt. 13<br />01:40:31 - Backwind - Ash Bradbury<br />01:42:06 - Carping Calamities - Mark Jackson{% endraw %}
