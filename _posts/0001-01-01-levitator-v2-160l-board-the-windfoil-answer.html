{% raw %}STABLE / PROGRESSION / FLOATY<br /><br />The Levitator V2 160L is our ultimate light-wind machine capable of flying in the lightest breeze and handling big sails and big riders. The board features adjustable foil tracks that allow you to precisely place the center of lift. Intermediate or advanced windsurfers will place the foil towards the back of the track and ride efficiently in the straps. Sliding the foil all the way forward allows beginner-level windsurfers to get up on the foil with their front foot by the mast base, in a beginner windsurf stanceâ€”now you can learn to windfoil before you have mastered the footstraps.<br />#Slingshot #windfoil #Windsurf #Windsurfing #foil #hydrofoil #Windfoiling #sailing #lightwind #slingshotfoil<br /><br />FIND YOUR WINDFOILS HERE: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://slingshotsports.com/products/levitator-v2-160l">https://slingshotsports.com/products/levitator-v2-160l</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://slingshotsports.com/collections/complete-foils-windsurf">https://slingshotsports.com/collections/complete-foils-windsurf</a><br /><br />STAY INFORMED: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blog.slingshotsports.com/">https://blog.slingshotsports.com/</a> <br /><br />CONNECT with SLINGSHOT ACTION: here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/slingshotfoil">https://www.facebook.com/slingshotfoil</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/slingshotfoil/">https://www.instagram.com/slingshotfoil/</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.slingshotsports.com">https://www.slingshotsports.com</a>{% endraw %}
