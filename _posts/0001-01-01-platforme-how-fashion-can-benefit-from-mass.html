{% raw %}Customization and personalization open a world of possibilities for Fashion, allowing customers to experiment with a variety of designs, graphics, fabrics, colors, and more, before any physical product is made, saving you thousands (even millions) on physical samples and photo-shooting. <br /><br />On-demand production eliminates the need for goods to be processed as consumers wait for them to be ordered. As a result, everything is made in response to customer demand. From a production standpoint, this allows for more flexibility for orders to be fulfilled because they are not seasonal. This may imply that goods can be manufactured to exact specifications or to a higher standard of quality.<br /><br />Fashion brands can scale up customization of fashion goods with technology to make customization profitable and efficient by employing Mass Customization connected to a fully integrated On-demand model of production.<br /><br />To learn more about us or request a demo, please, visit us at www.platforme.com<br /><br />Stay connected with us:<br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/platforme-international">https://www.linkedin.com/company/platforme-international</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/platforme.international">https://www.facebook.com/platforme.international</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/platforme.international/">https://www.instagram.com/platforme.international/</a>{% endraw %}
