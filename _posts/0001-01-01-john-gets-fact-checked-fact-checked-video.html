This is called aspiration.<br /><br />Rationale for aspirating<br /><br />vaccine could be inadvertently delivered into the blood rather than the muscle tissue. <br /><br />But as the flashback of blood hardly ever happens, the practice was abandoned by many practitioners. <br /><br />I have not seen any evidence to support the rejection of this hypothesis at this stage. <br /><br />The animal model study supports the possibility that inadvertent injection into a blood vessel could result in undesirable reactions. <br /><br />However, the majority of myocarditis cases are occurring in young males after the second dose, something that this hypothesis does not explain.<br /><br />My conclusion is that this requires more research and observing the patterns of post-vaccine myocarditis among populations where aspiration is practiced could be helpful.<br /><br />Common sense in Denmark<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.ssi.dk/news/epi-news/2021/no-19-21---2021">https://en.ssi.dk/news/epi-news/2021/no-19-21---2021</a><br /><br />COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen<br /><br />A single 0.5 mL dose of undiluted vaccine is given.<br /><br />Based on a precautionary principle, we recommend aspiration before injection.<br /><br />Download John's two comprehensive but free educational text books or make a donation to the campbellteaching project using this link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://159.69.48.3">http://159.69.48.3</a>{% endraw %}
