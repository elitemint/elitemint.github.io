{% raw %}In this video we explore more remote areas using our pack rafts to see how much gold is deposited in those more remote unexplored areas.  I team up with my mate Ron and we start our journey exploring new sections of river in one of our favorite areas.  We find good gold deposits including some gold nuggets which has us excited for a return trip.<br /><br />FOLLOW ME ACROSS THE WEB<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/tassieboysprospecting/">https://www.facebook.com/tassieboysprospecting/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tassie_boys_prospecting/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/tassie_boys_prospecting/?hl=en</a><br />My shop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tassieboysprospecting.theprintbar.com/">https://www.tassieboysprospecting.theprintbar.com/</a><br /><br />Buisness Enquiries: tassieboy@icloud.com<br /><br />#goldnuggets #goldrush #tassieboysprospecting{% endraw %}
