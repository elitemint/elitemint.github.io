{% raw %}The Biden administration is asking companies to follow through on the vaccine mandate. That's after a court temporarily halted it. Deputy White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said ‚ÄúWe say: do not wait to take actions that will keep your workplace safe. It is important and critical to do, and waiting to get more people vaccinated will lead to more outbreaks and sickness.‚Äù This comes as President Biden is asking the court to lift the order altogether.<br /><br />The Astroworld concert organizers are facing lawsuits. That's after Friday's tragedy left 8 dead and hundreds wounded. Authorities released the names of those who died. According to fans, a stampede towards the stage crushed concert goers.
