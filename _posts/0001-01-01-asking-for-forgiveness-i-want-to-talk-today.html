{% raw %}I want to talk today about asking for forgiveness. A few years ago I had a friend who I felt had taken advantage of me and I felt like the inside for me personally had kind of eaten away. I tried to shove it under the rug and maybe some of you can relate to that.<br /><br />And it was something that bothered me enough that it came up every few days. And so what I want to talk about today is how to practice forgiveness because the reality is, is that the law of forgiveness is a law that says you are mentally and emotionally healthy to the degree that you can freely forgive anyone who has hurt you in any way.<br /><br />And yes, that can include an ex-spouse if you have one? You are mentally and emotionally healthy to the degree that you can freely forgive anyone who has hurt you in any way. The only way that you can avoid the problems and the difficulties of living is to live in a cave. So you've got to ask yourself, “How long will it take me to get over this event and get on with my life?”<br /><br /><br />Download My Bankrupt to Abundance eBook here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/bankrupttoabundance">http://bit.ly/bankrupttoabundance</a><br /><br />Click play above to watch this week’s motivation so you can learn how to stay in peace.<br /><br />Download My Bankrupt to Abundance eBook here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/bankrupttoabundance">http://bit.ly/bankrupttoabundance</a><br /><br />———Connect With Brandon————<br /><br />Brandon on Social Media:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.mastermindwithbrandon.com">http://www.mastermindwithbrandon.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brandonboydofficial/">https://www.instagram.com/brandonboydofficial/</a><br /><br />Thank you for watching this video—Please Share it and get the word out!<br /><br />Watch my Morning Motivation playlist<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/morningmotivationplaylist">http://bit.ly/morningmotivationplaylist</a><br /><br />Watch my Network Marketing Training playlist <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/mlmtrainingplaylist">http://bit.ly/mlmtrainingplaylist</a><br /><br />👇 SUBSCRIBE TO BRANDON’S YOUTUBE CHANNEL NOW 👇<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/mastermindwithbrandontv">http://bit.ly/mastermindwithbrandontv</a><br /><br />#mastermindwithbrandon<br />#mastermindbrandonboyd<br />#morningmotivation{% endraw %}
