{% raw %}TECHNOLOGIES TO COMBAT THE CO2 IMPACT <br /><br />If There Is a Demand Business Will Always Fulfill That Demand.<br />We have reached the front-line of point of no return in producing contents to this groundbreaking interactive TV concept when this even more groundbreaking statement from venture capital investor, entrepreneur and author of several bestsellers, Mr. Lars Tvede is being released. <br />In a world increasingly aware of and affected by global warming, Tvede advocates for definite solutions to the huge climate challenges. One of these solutions is nuclear power plants based on thorium, a naturally occurring radioactive element, four times more abundant than uranium in the earth's crust.<br />How can we utilize thorium? How great stock of it does the earth keep for us? How much energy can a golf ball-sized pack of thorium produce? What about the radioactive waste. <br />Watch the short film and get the answers from Mr. Lars Tvede. <br /><br />Look for more on www.kontinentfilm.com{% endraw %}
