Regulating attention is often a challenge. Attention is not a thing; it spans time. Thinking spans time and is a process. From ADHD coach Jeff Copper’s (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://digcoaching.com)">http://digcoaching.com)</a> perspective there are two fundamental thinking processes – methodical and insightful. Both work very differently. To manage them, it is helpful to understand them as a process. In this video Jeff walks through two attention exercises using math to highlight the processes individually and then compares and contrasts the two. In the end, methodical thinking is something you can plan; it is predictable in terms of time and definable. Insightful thinking is difficult to predict in terms of how long it takes; it is an effortful, trial-and-error process. Understanding the type of thinking process being used can explain much of what is challenging for those with ADHD.
