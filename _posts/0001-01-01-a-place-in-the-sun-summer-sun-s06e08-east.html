{% raw %}East Menorca<br />Karl and Naomh first met at university, and are inseparable, even working from home together. They love the relaxed lifestyle of Menorca, and want to be near the beautiful beaches of its south east coast where they had their wedding. With Scarlette Douglas on hand and a top cash budget of Â£230,000, they are looking for a place with plenty of outside space for themselves and their two dogs.{% endraw %}
