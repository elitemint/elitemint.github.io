{% raw %}EnCompass is designed to deliver pivot corner water application uniformity. Prior to the introduction of EnCompass, water distribution was inconsistent and sporadic when used on pivot corners. With EnCompass intelligent water uniformity you can produce more crops with the potential to put an extra $10,000-$15,000 in your pocket. EnCompass relies on GPS data to adjust nozzle pressure in real time to pulse on and off to provide the exact flow needed.{% endraw %}
