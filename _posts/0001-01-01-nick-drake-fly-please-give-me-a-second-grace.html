{% raw %}Please give me a second grace<br /><br />Please give me a second face<br /><br />I've fallen far down <br /><br />The first time around<br /><br />Now I just sit on the ground in your way<br /><br /><br /><br />Now if it's time to recompense for what's done<br /><br />Come, come sit down on the fence in the sun<br /><br />And the clouds will roll by<br /><br />And we'll never deny<br /><br />It's really too hard for to fly.<br /><br /><br /><br />Please tell me your second name<br /><br />Please play me your second game<br /><br />I've fallen so far<br /><br />For the people you are<br /><br />I just need your star for a day.<br /><br /><br /><br />So come, come ride in my my street-car by the bay<br /><br />For now I must know how fine you are in your way<br /><br />And the sea sure as I<br /><br />But she won't need to cry<br /><br />For it's really too hard for to fly.{% endraw %}
