{% raw %}We are facing an unprecedented ecological crisis in our country today, on all fronts, including land, water and air. Need of the hour is a concerted effort from all stakeholders, to realize the emergency and act accordingly. Sustainability cannot be an academic discussion, it needs to be an on-ground practice, for there is no planet B. Vimlendu Jha is currently one of India’s foremost environmentalists. He founded Swechha in 2000 and has turned it into one of India’s most influential organisations on youth matters. In 2004, India’s leading news magazines, India Today and Outlook, acknowledged Vimlendu as one of the top 25 youth leaders of India. In the same year, he was profiled as one of the top 25 youth leaders of the world by the International Youth Foundation through the international publication ‘Our Time is Now’. In 2007, Vimlendu was selected as one of 6 worldwide change makers by CNN International to be part of the Be the Change programme, which followed his work for over a year and was viewed by more than 100 million people worldwide. Vimlendu serves on the board of several national and international foundations. In 2011, he was invited to speak at the UN General Assembly on youth issues in the global south. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
