{% raw %}The battle of Umbara was one of the bloodiest and most brutal battles of the Clones Wars, resulting in the deaths of many brave clone troopers and the fall of Jedi Master Pong Krell. The battle was so devastating that it shook the citizens of the Republic to their core, and started to turn public opinion about the war. But what many of them didn’t know was that the actions of one of the most widely respected senators, Padme Amidala actually led to the Umbarans succeeding from the Republic and sparking the battle. How did she do this? Lets find out!<br /><br />Follow me on twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/StarForceOneYT">https://twitter.com/StarForceOneYT</a><br /><br />#StarWars #Umbara #TheClone Wars<br /><br />Umbara or “The Shadow World” was a planet deep out in the expansion region of the galaxy and was a heavy exporter of the material doonium, which was used in many republic starships and later even the death star. Umbara was a very strong supporter of the Republic from its earliest days and was extremely loyal all the way through the opening phase of the clone wars… This changed very quickly however after the assassination of Rodian Senator Anaconda Farr.<br /><br />Being devastated by the death of her close Friend, Senator from Naboo Padme Amidala initiated a private investigation into who killed the senator, completely failing to get approval from the Republic security committee or the Supreme chancellor of the Republic.{% endraw %}
