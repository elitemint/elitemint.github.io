{% raw %}Whiteheads form when the pores in the skin get clogged with oil, dead skin cells, and grime. The subsequent result is either a blackhead or a whitehead. Now, whiteheads can be popped with ease, as the skin thinly traps debris.<br /><br />Whiteheads, on the other hand, donâ€™t hurt as much, however, their extraction is a lot harder. The black color that you see is caused by the exposed comedones. Comedone is a mass of oil and dead skin which changes color when exposed to oxygen.<br /><br /><br />#blackheadremoval #blackheadextraction #blackheadsears #blackheadpopping{% endraw %}
