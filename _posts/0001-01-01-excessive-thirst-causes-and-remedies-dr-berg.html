Excessive thirst is typically a symptom of something else going on. We’re going to cover why you might be experiencing excessive thirst, and what to do about it. <br /><br />A few causes of excessive thirst:   <br /><br />1. Habit<br />Some people drink a lot of water simply out of habit, but they’re not really thirsty. However, drinking a lot of water and not exercising could lead to a condition called hyponatremia. Hyponatremia is a situation where you have low sodium. <br /><br />2. Diabetes <br />If you consume a lot of sugar, or you have a blood sugar problem, this could cause you to lose more water. This loss of water will then trigger something in your brain that tells you to drink more water. With this situation, we’re talking about diabetes mellitus.<br /><br />3. Low potassium <br />If you don’t eat vegetables, and you’re not taking a potassium supplement, you could become potassium deficient. A potassium deficiency alone could cause excessive thirst. <br /><br />4. High sodium <br />A diet high in sodium and low in potassium could cause excessive thirst. Foods with hidden sodium like MSG can also cause this issue. <br /><br />5. Drugs (diuretics, steroids, psych drugs) <br />Certain drugs can cause excessive thirst. <br /><br />6. High calcium <br />Having high amounts of calcium in the blood is called hypercalcemia. This condition can trigger similar effects to diabetes, including excessive thirst. One rare cause of hypercalcemia is cancer. Other potential causes could be hyperparathyroidism, lithium, or high amounts of vitamin D. <br /><br />Remedies for excessive thirst:<br /> • Drink when you’re thirsty<br /> • Get enough sea salt in your diet (about 1 tsp.)<br /> • Get on a low carb diet <br /> • Consume lots of foods high in potassium <br /><br /><br />Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:<br />Dr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis &amp; Intermittent Fasting.
