{% raw %}This video is part 2 of a job to replace the hydraulic cylinder boom lift barrel and pistons off a Hitachi Zaxis 670 Excavator. Something has failed or made its way inside the cylinder and absolutely destroyed the pistons and scratched up the inside of the barrels, so we need to make 2 new pistons and replace the barrels! This part 2 shows the step by step process of repairing the damaged hydraulic cylinder barrels. We are starting with the old barrels and machining off the barrel eye and head flange. We then machine up the new barrel before fitting and welding the eye and head flange onto the new barrel to complete the job.<br /><br />If you missed Part 1 Making the Pistons watch it here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/gxIQoaakg1o">https://youtu.be/gxIQoaakg1o</a><br /><br />In this video we are using: <br />- Hafco TM-26120G Centre Lathe<br />- WIA 500i Weldmatic welder<br /><br />Join our channel:<br />We upload new videos every Friday at 5pm AEST!
