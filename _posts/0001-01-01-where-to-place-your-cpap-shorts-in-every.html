{% raw %}In every single cpap manual they all say the same thing! &quot;Position your cpap machine lower than your bed height&quot; but why?<br /><br />It's all to do with humidity (and rain out!) which is very common especially during the winter months.<br /><br />Does it really matter? Not so much if you're not having issues with water building up in your tube but if you are then try placing it closer to the ground (ideally off the ground though as it's very dusty down near the ground). <br /><br />You might also notice the therapy is more quiet!<br /><br />Cheers big ears<br />Old mate Nicko{% endraw %}
