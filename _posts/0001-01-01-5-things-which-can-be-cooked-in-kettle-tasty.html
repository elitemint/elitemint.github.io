{% raw %}This is my firt vlog. In this video you will learn how to make 5 things in kettle. <br />This video will be helpful to you when you are out off gas or don’t have induction and specially when you are on trip and a hosteller. <br />The 5 things I made in kettle are very easy to make and good in taste:<br /><br />1. Maggi (2 minutes maggi in 20 seconds lol.)<br /><br />2. Veg rice ( I brought rice and onions from mess. You can add more veggies.) <br /><br />3. Poha ( you can add onions, tomatoes, potatoes as well. One normal size poha packet can serve 5 people.) <br /><br />4. Oats (you can add sugar and dry fruits of your choice. I like oats without sugar and that’s what makes it healthy diet food.)<br /><br />5. Egg bhurji ( stir well and stir untill the liquid mixture becomes solid.) <br /><br />I prefer maggi masala in almost everything because it adds a different taste in food, and I like that taste (I hope the same for you as well).<br /><br /><br />Try it and tell me in comments. <br />Thank you.{% endraw %}
