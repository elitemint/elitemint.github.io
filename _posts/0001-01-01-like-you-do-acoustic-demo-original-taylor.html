{% raw %}Hey y'all! Here is what we came up with at the Spotify Secret Genius Studio! Once again, thanks to CD Baby for giving me the opportunity to make something cool! Hope you enjoy a good ol' cheatin' song :) <br /><br />I slip my ring into my pocket<br />I know I shouldn't be doin' what I'm doin' but I am<br />You open the door you didn't even lock it<br />'Cause you knew I'd be here<br />You know me like the back of your hand<br />I wish he knew me like that<br /><br />Wish he knew all the words to my favorite song<br />The one you always sing harmony on<br />I wish he knew how I liked my drinks<br />I like 'em a lot stronger than he thinks I do<br />And I toss and turn when I lay down at night<br />Tryin' to figure out how I can pick a fight <br />And get out with the cleanest wound<br />'Cause he don't know me <br />Like you do<br /><br />I lay down in the bed beside you<br />I know I shouldn't be doin' what I'm doin' but I am <br />And I can't stand I'm being untrue<br />I'd tell him but he wouldn't understand<br />'Cause he don't know me like that<br /><br />Wish he knew all the words to my favorite song<br />The one you always sing harmony on<br />I wish he knew how I liked my drinks<br />I like 'em a lot stronger than he thinks I do<br />And I toss and turn when I lay down at night<br />Tryin' to figure out how I can pick a fight <br />And get out with the cleanest wound<br />'Cause he don't know me <br />Like you do<br /><br />And I'm back and forth <br />And it's a living hell <br />And I've made my mind up <br />But I can't tell him <br />That I choose you<br />It's always been you<br /><br />Cause you know all the words to my favorite song<br />The one you always sing harmony on<br />You know just how I like my drinks <br />I like 'em a lot stronger than he thinks I do <br />And I toss and turn when I lay down at night<br />Tryin' to figure out how I can pick a fight <br />And get out with the cleanest wound<br />'Cause he don't know me<br />No he'll never know me <br />He don't know me <br />Like you do{% endraw %}
