Caddicarus is FINALLY back in the first Caddicarus episode about Crash Bandicoot for 2021. The PC problems may be awful, but at least those PC issues canâ€™t get in the way of Bandicoot Month! Today, as Caddicarus Crash Bandicoot review videos seem to go down okay (even though I donâ€™t classify my stuff as reviews anymore) I figured it would be fun to carry on from my old Crash Bandicoot XS review or Crash Bandicoot The Huge Adventure review on the Gameboy Advance, and naturally take a shot at a Crash 2 N Tranced review on GBA. But hey, a Caddicarus Crash 2 N Tranced review on its own is no fun. And how about a Caddicarus Crash Purple review? Crash Fusion? I did do a video on Spyro Orange or Spyro Fusion on the GBA, so that makes sense to show off Crash Bandicoot Gameboy Advance gameplay on all fronts - including Crash Nitro Kart GBA. But then, we went down the rabbit hole. If I was already gonna cover all the Nintendo Gameboy games in 1 video, then why not look at the Nintendo DS Crash Bandicoot games? Thereâ€™s Crash Boom Bang gameplay with a Crash Boom Bang review (again, not really a review, but I donâ€™t know what else to call it for YouTube to recognise the stupid stuff I do), and even Crash of the Titans DS gameplay, Mind Over Mutant DS gameplay, and then OH MY, thereâ€™s also the Crash Bandicoot PSP games! Tag Team Racing PSP gameplay with a Tag Team Racing review, Mind Over Mutant PSP gameplay, Crash of the Titans PSP gameplay - and no, it doesnâ€™t end there. Did you know that Tiger Electronics had a crash game? Yep, the Tiger LCD Games that the AVGN made infamous - they got their mitts on Cash Banooca. From Angry Video Game Nerd Tiger Electronics to Caddy - get ready to see Crash Bandicoot 99x, which was actually the first ever portable crash game. Tiger Electronics Crash Bandicoot. What. And thatâ€™s not all - how about the free McDonaldâ€™s Happy Meal games? Crash Bandicoot Happy Meal and Spyro Happy Meal games were a thing - CRASH BANDICOOT MCDONALDS GAMES ARE A THING, WHAT. Oh, and then thereâ€™s the Crash Bandicoot Java games like Mutant Island gameplay, Crash Bandicoot ExEn gameplay with an Infusio emulator - Java Mobile phone games had crash, with lots of Twinsanity Mobile versions, and then thereâ€™s Nitro Kart 3D iOS and Nitro Kart 2 iOS - and speaking of iPhone, we even round off with a Crash On the Run review with Crash on the Run gameplay for the iPhone, even though itâ€™s also Android as well as iOS. Iâ€™m gonna sleep now, this was an effort to type.<br /><br /><br />Caddicarus 8bit themes by Endigo = <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Endigo">https://www.youtube.com/user/Endigo</a><br /><br />Caddicarus logo by Jan Animation = <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jananimationstudios/videos">https://www.youtube.com/user/jananimationstudios/videos</a><br /><br />Kevin MacLeod's royalty free music! = <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com">http://incompetech.com</a><br /><br />OLLY'S CAMERA WORK! = <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/SuperOllyRoss">https://www.youtube.com/SuperOllyRoss</a><br /><br /><br />Watch more comedy game reviews like my Crash on the Run review on my channel! | Caddicarus<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Caddicarus">https://www.youtube.com/user/Caddicarus</a><br /><br />#CrashBandicoot #Bandicoot #Caddicarus #PSP #GBA #GameBoy{% endraw %}
