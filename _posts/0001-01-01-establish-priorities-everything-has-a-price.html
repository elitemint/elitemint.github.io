{% raw %}So how well do you know yourself?<br />How well do you know your values?<br />How often do you review and rewrite your priorities?<br /><br />FOCUS!!! <br /><br />And learn this: in the market of life, usually the best things are the most desired, and the best things are usually the ones that REQUIRE the biggest sacrifices. <br /><br />Did you hear that? It´s not just work. Everybody goes to work.<br />It´s sacrifice. <br /><br />So please, before starting something, or when you are about to reach it, think about it as an exchange. Life is an exchange of energy and matter. Your success will be an exchange of your energy and skills and time and effort for ... whatever the outcome is for your goals.<br /><br />Remember nothing is guaranteed, and never play too hard that you lose your life or kindness in the process. Stay kind, stay humble. Stay humane.<br /><br />Love.{% endraw %}
