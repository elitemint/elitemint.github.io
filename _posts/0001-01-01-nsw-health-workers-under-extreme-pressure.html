{% raw %}Health workers in New South Wales are under “extreme pressure” as the state battles a surge in COVID cases, according to NSW Nurses and Midwives' Association Acting Secretary Shaye Candish. <br /><br />It comes after NSW Dominic Perrottet announced elective surgery would be suspended for non-urgent surgeries until mid-February in an effort to relieve the pressure on the health system. <br /><br />“We would welcome anything that helps to reduce the transmission at the moment because our nurses and midwives, they really need all the help that they can get,” Ms Candish told Sky News Australia.  <br /><br />“They’re working double shifts, they're working huge amounts of overtime, they’re doing most of their work in complete plastic, head to toe.  <br /><br />“Some of them are working out in makeshift triage tents in the middle of the summer heat. It’s a really challenging time.”{% endraw %}
