{% raw %}The American Bison was once one of the most populous large animals native to North America. These animals were estimated to be in the 60,000,000 range prior to the 1800's and ranged the vast majority of western North America. Sadly, during the 1800's the United States government practically declared war on this species as a way of destabilizing and destroying this resource that was necessary for many countless native American tribes to survive. This led to an almost extinction level event wiping out millions of animals until just a few hundred remained. Now it's estimated only about 30,000 animals still remain in the wild after years of conservation, and the vast majority inhabit parks or wildlife refuges. Bison are a beautiful part of America's natural history, and an influential species in the biomes to which they belong. It is quite sad the level of destruction this species has seen and experienced. At least we still have small pockets reminiscent of that great time. Have you ever seen a Bison?
