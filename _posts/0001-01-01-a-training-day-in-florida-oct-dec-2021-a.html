{% raw %}A mix of videos from October/November/December... it was hard to film all on one day because it gets so busy and takes so much time! Maybe I'll make one more of these in Feb or March before I hit the road for clinics :)<br /><br />Facebook/Instagram: @vanfleetmustangs<br />Website: vanfleetmustangs.com<br /><br />#wildhorse​​​ #horsetraining​​​ #coltstarting​​​<br /><br />Hey! My name is Sam and I enjoy making content of all my horse adventures and sharing some training tips to help others understand horses a little better.
