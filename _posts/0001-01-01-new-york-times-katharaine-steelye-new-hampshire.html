{% raw %}An article surfaced from New York Times' writer Katharaine Q. Steelye in regards to a group of New Hampshire progressives, business owners, and select individuals are of the belief that New Hampshire is waaaay too white.  Apparently, the White population is 94% and it's completely unacceptable.<br /><br />UNACCEPTABLE I TELL YOU!  COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!!<br /><br />The solution?  Forced ethnic integration - oh, and I am certain it's not going to matter if the targets cater to EXTREME CULTURAL DIFFERENCES - so long as New Hampshire is....'diverse'.  <br /><br />New policies that incentivize businesses and locals.   Many ideas are still being floated around to FORCE this diversity - whether it's beneficial or not, an individual's color seems to be the force focal-point of this movement.<br /><br />This silent movement to continue eradicating White people is obviously happening here.  It's an eradication of a culture, and - just like doing this to any other ethnic group - it's a disgusting act.<br /><br />Here's my view regarding the reason why flooding New Hampshire (or any state in the United States) with multi-culture/multi-ethnic/multi-diversity/whatever needs to be organic, and not forced.  Otherwise, we'd bring in a lot of people who refuse to acclimate and segregate themselves to cause more rift and chaos eventually.<br /><br />Peace out!{% endraw %}
