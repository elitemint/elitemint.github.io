{% raw %}0:00 Montage<br />3:54 Short explanation of how I feel<br />10:02 Game 1 (Pretty decent game)<br />41:18 In depth discussion of Janna changes<br />43:51 Maths on 20% CD Janna E mechanic<br />46:29 Why I believe the buffs to Q are insane<br />57:40 20% CD Janna E mechanic skill expression<br />1:01:47 Calm down and give the changes some time<br />1:03:10 Shield decay rant<br />1:06:18 Apdo's thoughts on Janna (Rank 1 Korea and best solo queue player in the world)<br />1:09:51 Game 2 (Meh game because the enemy team inted but still very good Janna Qs)<br />1:40:37 Game 3 (Another meh game because enemy team were not good)<br />2:10:49 Game 4 (Vey good game to demonstrate Janna's Q potential)<br />2:37:17 Give the Janna changes some time (again)<br />2:39:36 Game 5 (Very good game to demonstrate Janna's Q potential)<br />3:04:03 Game 6 (Pretty good game)<br />3:18:29 Game 7 (VERY INSANE GAME like why is this PBE game more exciting than worlds???)<br /><br />Everything is still possible to change and that includes my opinions. Some people disagree with me on the increased skill expression because they say Janna's Q is easier to land, which is a fair argument. I've been thinking about it more and I somewhat agree (until I see the win rate stats). I don't really care if Janna has more or less skill expression because people will just call you a boosted Janna player anyways so I'm fine either way. I'm going to wait for the stats on new Janna after a few weeks and compare the win rates of low ranked and high ranked Janna games.<br /><br /><br />ðŸŽ® Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/luminumn">https://www.twitch.tv/luminumn</a><br />ðŸ’‹ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Luminumn">https://twitter.com/Luminumn</a><br />ðŸ“· Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/luminumn/">https://www.instagram.com/luminumn/</a><br />ðŸ“± TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@luminum?lang=en">https://www.tiktok.com/@luminum?lang=en</a><br />ðŸ“˜ Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Luminumn">https://www.facebook.com/Luminumn</a><br /><br />I have MERCH!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://luminumn.live/merch">https://luminumn.live/merch</a><br /><br />ðŸŽ¥ Second channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LuminumUntucked">https://www.youtube.com/c/LuminumUntucked</a><br /><br />Business email: luminum@clickmgmt.com.au<br /><br /><br />YesStyle (Korean Beauty and Fashion Online Store)<br />DISCOUNT CODE: LUMINUM<br />DISCOUNT LINK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ystyle.co/quCv">https://ystyle.co/quCv</a><br />New customers that use my code AND click the link above get 10% off their purchases!<br />Returning customers get 4% off!<br /><br />Outsmart your opponents with Porofessor: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://link.overwolf.com/Porofessor-Luminum">https://link.overwolf.com/Porofessor-Luminum</a><br /><br />ExitLag VPN 15% discount code:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2z7cwFR">http://bit.ly/2z7cwFR</a><br /><br /><br />Songs: Nightcore - All The Things She Said (Seraphine)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxVqCKVVO0Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxVqCKVVO0Q</a><br /><br />Nightcore âž¥ Made Me This Way - Seraphine<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D4rBO6CwCg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D4rBO6CwCg</a>{% endraw %}
