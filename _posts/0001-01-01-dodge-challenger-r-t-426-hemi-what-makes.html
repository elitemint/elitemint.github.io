{% raw %}Of the 165,000 first-generation Challengers sold, the 1970 models are widely regarded as the best, and of those, the one to have would be this, the R/T 426 Hemi hardtop with the 4 speed 'Pistol Grip' manual.  Only 137 were ever made so to have one land in Iain's workshop is a rare treat indeed!  If the 'Hemi Orange' paint scheme doesn't stop you in your tracks then the glorious sound of that 7L V8 Chrysler Hemi engine surely will!<br /><br />Iain delves in to the history of this Hemi engine and it's NASCAR roots, and explains why the quoted figure of 425bhp may be downplaying this model's true performance, from an engine that's easily capable of much more.  After a technical breakdown of the key differences between the Hemi combustion chamber and the more conventional design of that period, it's time to tune the engine, before unleashing this beast to see how it handles an English B-Road.<br /><br />This fine example is up for auction with The Market by Bonhams:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://themarket.co.uk/en/listings/dodge/rt-426-hemi-challenger/a90f53ab-c93f-43c2-8438-dfbac83d9720">https://themarket.co.uk/en/listings/dodge/rt-426-hemi-challenger/a90f53ab-c93f-43c2-8438-dfbac83d9720</a><br /><br />00:00 - Introduction and history of the car<br />04:49 - Engine Combustion Chamber comparison<br />07:49 - Engine tuning<br />08:50 - Road test<br />16:23 - Outro<br /><br />Thank you once again to everyone for the overwhelming reception of these videos and for all the support of likes, subscribes and wonderful comments.  <br /><br />This video was brought to you by Aston Lark - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.astonlark.com/tyrrellsworkshop">https://www.astonlark.com/tyrrellsworkshop</a><br />Filmed and edited by Whipp3dCream - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whipp3dcream.com/">https://whipp3dcream.com/</a><br /><br />Interested in purchasing a classic car?
