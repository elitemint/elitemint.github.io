We have a dream to build a self sustainable future and regenerate the land for generations to come. Join us as we learn to build, farm, garden, and care for the animals and land. <br /><br />We live and farm on the land of the Arakwal and Minjungbal people of the Bundjalung Nation and these practices of regenerative living, agriculture and permaculture owe their roots and theories to Indigenous knowledge — they have been practiced by Indigenous People around the world for so many years. We acknowledge the Traditional Custodians of the Country we live on, and recognise their continuing connection to the land and waters. We thank them for protecting this rainforest and its ecosystems since time immemorial.<br /><br />Music by Indira Elias: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://indiraelias.com/">https://indiraelias.com/</a><br />&quot;Soon Enough&quot;, &quot;Urania&quot;, &quot;Far Too Young&quot;, and &quot;Lend Me&quot;<br /><br />Chapters: <br />0:00 Hot summer days off grid<br />2:51 Planting a permaculture orchard, start to finish! <br />6:01 Swimming in the heat of the day <br />11:26 Planting more fruit trees, picking mangoes and cooking a green mango dhal{% endraw %}
