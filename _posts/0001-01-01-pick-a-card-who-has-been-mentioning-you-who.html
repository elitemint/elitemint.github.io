{% raw %}⌚️Timestamps⌚️:<br /><br />Announcements - 00:00<br />In this pick a card topic we'll be looking at who has been mentioning you and your name to others, who has your name on their lips and what they might be saying about you right now. This is not specifically just pertaining to love interests, this could be anyone friend, family, foe, whoever's energy I might pick up on, each video is a little longer because I've included scrabble letter tiles at the end, if you don't like that part just skip. <br /><br />Also just a heads up, these messages may be triggering to some, so if you're easily triggered by what others are saying behind your back I suggest you skip this video for a later time. 🦜🧿🕵️🏽‍♀️🤳🏽🚨<br /><br />Pile Selection:  2:22<br /><br />1.
