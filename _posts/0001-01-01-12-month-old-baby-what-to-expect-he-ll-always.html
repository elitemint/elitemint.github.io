But first, you have a busy month ahead: planning a birthday party bash, of course, but also planning for life with a walking, talking toddler. <br />Yes, talking, with that first real word likely coming soon if it hasn't already. Half of all little ones will have filled in that epic blank in their baby books by the end of the month. <br />And it goes without saying: baby will also be busy this month. By now, your almost toddler is probably cruising, possibly standing on her own at least momentarily, and maybe even walking. Or, she may still be content on all fours. Who needs to walk when you can crawl at warp speed? <br />No matter what, she'll love the extra push toward independence that a push toy or a ride-on toy can give her especially if it has plenty of storage space. Babies this age don't pack lightly. They'll fill a doll stroller, shopping cart, scooter with whatever it will hold, and not just toys. Watch your wallet and your keys too, or they'll be among the many objects grabbed and stashed for the ride. <br />Something else you'll have to clearly keep your eye on: your more mobile munchkin. Yes, you childproofed your home months ago, but that was with a baby in mind. You surveyed potential dangers from the floor where your baby sat, rolled, and practiced crawling. Now you'll have to add a vertical layer to those protections with upward mobility in mind, too, walking and climbing. <br />And remember, while your little one probably understands the word no, you won't be able to count on him taking no for an answer. Follow up and more follow up will be needed every time he heads towards trouble. <br />Still, though compliance is a parental pipe dream for now, this is the time to start laying the foundation for behavior expectations. What's okay to do, what's not, what's safe, what's not, what's right, what's wrong, what's acceptable, what isn't. <br />Rules won't rule your baby's behavior for a while, but you can and should start setting some basic ones. Your baby's definitely not slowing down these days, but bottle feedings should be. Breastfeeding can continue as long as you're both onboard, but weaning from a bottle should come soon after the first birthday. <br />And here's something to moo about. Whole cow's milk, which can be introduced at a year, preferably from a cup. Do check with a doctor before moving on. This is also when solids start to pick up more of the nutritional slack for a tot, so healthy does it. <br />Chances are your little one doesn't love taking time from her action-packed schedule for sleep, but the right number of Zs fuels that baby battery. She may need more convincing and winding down than ever, but she still needs two naps for a daytime sleep total of about three hours, plus about 11 hours at night. <br />Considering a switch from crib to toddler bed with toddlerhood fast approaching? Consider this: toddlers sleep better and for longer stretches in a crib than in a bed. A crib is also the safest spot for sleep until your little one is too big to fit in one, two-and-a-half to three years, or about 35 inches. Make sure the mattress is at the lowest level, and if he starts active escape attempts, pad the floor around the crib. <br />Thinking a pillow or blanket might make your sweet sleeper more comfy at night? It's safer for baby to continue sleeping without cushy companions until at least age 18 months. Plus, your baby's still too wriggly a sleeper to keep his head on a pillow, or stay tucked in under a blanket. Here's to an amazing end to your baby's amazing first year.{% endraw %}
