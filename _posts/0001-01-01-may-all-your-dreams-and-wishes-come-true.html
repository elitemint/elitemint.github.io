{% raw %}I wish you the very best ‚ù§Ô∏è Best community ever ‚ù§Ô∏è<br />This is Softbody Simulation Playground V42 with a little bit like Christmas edition.<br />I wanted to end up doing something with a lot of snow. The render times were astronomical. Unfortunately, the result looked very bad. It didn't look like snow but like styrofoam balls. I then changed my mind and put down more gifts for it.<br />Rendertime: 40 hours<br /><br />Checkout  my new Channel: Softbody-Simulation ‚ù§Ô∏èüòç‚ù§Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvoNfu1rfLZ7xupB1RcrF2g">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvoNfu1rfLZ7xupB1RcrF2g</a><br /><br />ASMR for my eyes ;)<br />Relax and enjoy this video. Some people make it happy and satisfied. It also has a calming effect.<br /><br />My Equipment:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://c4d4u.one/my-equipment/">https://c4d4u.one/my-equipment/</a><br /><br />Website:<br />  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://c4d4u.one">https://c4d4u.one</a><br />Twitter:<br />  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/C4D4U">https://twitter.com/C4D4U</a><br />Facebook:<br />  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/C4D4U-420803691739156">https://www.facebook.com/C4D4U-420803691739156</a><br />Instagram:<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/c4d4u/">https://www.instagram.com/c4d4u/</a><br />TikTok:<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@c4d4u">https://www.tiktok.com/@c4d4u</a><br /><br />MUSIC-MODE ;)<br />Why don't I enter the music title anymore.<br />Well, unfortunately some people not only copy my animations (because they have no ideas of their own) but even use exactly the same music. <br />These people may now search for it themselves ;)<br />I hope for your understanding.{% endraw %}
