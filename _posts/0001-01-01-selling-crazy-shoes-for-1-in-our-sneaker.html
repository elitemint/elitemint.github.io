We also show you our first WhatNot live, where we did $1 Sneaker Auctions on tons of crazy sneakers in our shoe store. We had a customer come in and we cashed a few pairs of sneakers from this reseller. We also give you sneaker investing advice on the Jordan 1 Low Mocha. We spent $25,000 on pairs we unboxed today. We bought a giant pack of Nike Dunk Low Pandas and more rare shoes. This is a cash out we would normally do at a sneaker event / show. We were able to get some great deals on these shoes, for us to make a good profit on. This really is what goes on in a day in the life of a sneaker business. We also share some sneaker reselling advice. We show you many sneaker unboxings in this video, which also feel like sneaker mystery boxes to us sometimes. We are starting a twitch stream, so make sure to go follow us on that platform! We also share that we will be at Sneaker Con Boston this weekend. Based on how Sneakercon Denver, Sneakercon Dallas, Sneakercon Chicago, Sneaker con San Jose / Bay Area, Sneakercon Atlanta, Boston Got Sole, New York / New Jersey Got Sole and Sneaker con Phoenix went, Kobey's Swap Meet will be a BANGER. We hope you all enjoy the videos and thank you for the continued support!<br /><br />If you guys are in the Phoenix, Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, Tempe or Scottsdale area in Arizona, come check out our shop located in Tempe!<br /><br />Help me hit 20K followers on Instagram<br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thecommonhype/">https://www.instagram.com/thecommonhype/</a><br />Store IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/commonhypeaz/">https://www.instagram.com/commonhypeaz/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/thecommonhype">https://twitter.com/thecommonhype</a><br />Cook Group: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thegoodchefs/">https://www.instagram.com/thegoodchefs/</a>{% endraw %}
