{% raw %}In this video, a team from the Centre for Mining, Equipment, Technology and Service Business Innovation (CMBI) at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), in collaboration with the Cooperative Research Centre for Optimising Resource Extraction (CRC ORE) show how to use the iCAT tool in conjunction with the model they developed to capture the process and practices involved in technology adoption in mining.  CMBI also produces written research reports on a range of specific operational challenges faced by the mining sector. <br /><br />More information here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://research.qut.edu.au/cmbi/research/innovation-adoption-and-diffusion/">https://research.qut.edu.au/cmbi/research/innovation-adoption-and-diffusion/</a><br />These resources can be downloaded at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://research.qut.edu.au/cmbi/resources/">https://research.qut.edu.au/cmbi/resources/</a>{% endraw %}
