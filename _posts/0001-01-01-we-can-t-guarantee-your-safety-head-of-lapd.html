{% raw %}LAPD Crime<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2CHLudt">https://bit.ly/2CHLudt</a><br /><br />As of 2021 California has the strictest gun laws in the country, where Gun Control groups and Politicians rave about California's strict Gun laws.<br /><br />Yet, an LAPD Detective just said this:<br /><br />&quot;My message to anyone thinking about coming to Los Angeles, especially during the holiday season, is don't,&quot; Jamie McBride, the head of the LA Police Protective League, the union representing LAPD officers, said in a television interview.<br /><br />The message from McBride comes as what many residents and business owners view as a wave of crime slamming the city and surrounding areas.<br /><br />&quot;We can't guarantee your safety. It is really, really out of control. I said it to people before, it's like that movie 'Purge,' you know, instead of 24 hours to commit your crime, these people have 365 days days to commit whatever they want,&quot; McBride said.<br /><br />LA is a free for all for criminals because of the politicians and their policies. <br /><br />Too many people in LA are obsessed with being progressive instead of being obsessed with reality. <br /><br />Progressive ideology says, &quot;We are a modern society we don't need guns, because we have the police, avocado toast, and Teslas!&quot; <br /><br />It's time to face reality. Being anti-gun doesn't make you a better person; it just makes you a better target.<br /><br />These criminals know you don't have guns. They're fully aware of your naivety and the false sense of safety.<br /><br /> The police are now literally telling you that they can't keep you safe.<br /><br /> So what are you going to do? Pass more gun control laws and hope that the criminals see the error in their ways and stop being criminals? <br /><br />No, Gun control is a political blank check that politicians can cash anytime they don't want to deal with real issues.<br /><br />Join MY Exclusive Text List &amp; Automatically be entered in our monthly LifePods &amp; PRO 2A Giveaways<br />➡️ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3FFLHJi">https://bit.ly/3FFLHJi</a><br /><br />Let's Go Brandon Merchandise<br />➡️ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3EbcXP8">https://bit.ly/3EbcXP8</a> <br /><br />GUNS ARE ESSENTIAL Merchandise<br />➡️ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2XxJxbT">https://bit.ly/2XxJxbT</a><br /><br />If I Only Had One Concealed Carry - FREE Book<br />➡️ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mrcolionnoir.com/start-here/">https://www.mrcolionnoir.com/start-here/</a><br /><br />To Order Your PRO 2A Hats Click Here: <br />➡️ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.mrcolionnoir.com/collections/hats">https://shop.mrcolionnoir.com/collections/hats</a><br /><br />Help US Further our Pro Constitution, Pro 2A message:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.MrColionNoir.com/donate/">https://www.MrColionNoir.com/donate/</a><br /><br />FOLLOW ME ON:<br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mrcolionnoir">https://twitter.com/mrcolionnoir</a><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/colionnoir/">https://www.instagram.com/colionnoir/</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/COLIONNOIR/">https://www.facebook.com/COLIONNOIR/</a><br /><br />#GunsAreEssential #ColionNoir{% endraw %}
