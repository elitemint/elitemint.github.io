{% raw %}#MoneyMantras #PowerfulMoneyAffirmations #ManifestMoney #ManifestAbundance #ImAMoneyMagnet<br /><br />Money mantras are used by some of the wealthiest, most successful, and often, just flat out more abundant people in society. What are money mantras? They're phrases that you repeat to yourself that convey a certainty about the fact that abundance, money, love, passion, or fulfillment are rushing towards you. <br /><br />My money mantras include:<br />&quot;I get more checks in the mail than bills&quot;<br />&quot;Money comes easily and frequently&quot;<br />&quot;Work, then get paid get paid get paid get paid&quot;<br />&quot;My money works harder than I do&quot;<br />&quot;Abundance is my natural state of being&quot;<br />&quot;I always have more than enough&quot;<br />&quot;I AM always more than enough&quot;<br />&quot;I LOVE mailbox money!&quot;<br /><br />To use money mantras to your advantage, it's imperative that you say these phrases with conviction. Using them at certain times is also incredibly important. As an example, if you go to the mailbox and there are bills, by telling yourself &quot;I get more checks than I do bills&quot; will fire your subconscious into overdrive figuring out how to make that statement true. The flip side is saying to yourself, &quot;Ugh, another bill.&quot; Which then fires your negative emotions related to getting bills -- a way to guarantee that you won't be getting more checks. <br /><br />If it all sounds New Age-y, I accept that and tell you that it's worked for me for years, so give it a try and see what happens. <br /><br />==================================<br />Adam Carroll is an internationally recognized financial literacy speaker, author, and consultant.
