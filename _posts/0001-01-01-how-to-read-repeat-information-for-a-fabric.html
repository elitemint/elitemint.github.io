I'm Jennifer, sales manager at #1 Fabric Company. And today I want to talk to you about how to read repeat information for a fabric.<br /><br />When you're looking at a fabric book, on the back of each sample, a repeat information area is listed. It tells you the width of this fabric. In this case its 54 inches and it tells you the repeat information.<br /><br />The vertical repeat on this fabric is 4 and 3 quarter inches and the horizontal repeat is 5. That means the space between the center of this medallion and the center of that medallion will be 5 inches.<br /><br />The center of this medallion and the center of this medallion will be the vertical repeat, and it measures 4 and 3 quarters inch.<br /><br />This information is important when figuring out how much yardage you need for your project. Sometimes, when you're working with a pattern with a larger repeat, more fabric will be needed to center the design on the piece you're having done. April, our account manager, is going to explain how to read the repeat of a larger pattern.<br /><br />Thank you Jen. Now I'd like to show you how a larger repeat on your pattern will affect the quantity required for your project. Let's take a look at this one, for example. It has a larger repeat.<br /><br />The whole width of the fabric is 54 inches from here to here. So we've got a repeat of about 13 and a half inches from the center of this medallion to the center of this medallion. So if you're working with a smaller cushion or pillow, say this one that's 18 inches, you would like to center the medallion and you could get multiple pieces to make your pillow out of this with the fabric.<br /><br />However, if you have a larger cushion, say it's 32 inches, and you don't want to put any seams in it, you would have to center the medallion. Right here. And what's left on each side would be excess fabric. So you can see how having a larger repeat, depending on the project you're working with of course. Would affect the amount of yardage needed.<br /><br />I hope this short video explained to you what a repeat on fabric means. If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call or an email.
