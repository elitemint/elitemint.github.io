As a teenager, Paige, now 20, suffered from irregular periods - but didn't think much of it for years. That was until, aged 18, she went for a checkup, and was immediately referred for an MRI scan, which revealed that she has two vaginas, two uteruses, and two cervixes, separated by a thin piece of tissue called a septum. Initially, medics thought she had uterine didelphys, but it has recently been confirmed that she has a similar, much rarer condition called complete septate uterus. &quot;Doctors hadn't seen a patient like me in 10 years,&quot; she said.<br />Last year, Paige decided to speak out about her condition on TikTok, in a bid to raise awareness. And now, while the complications her condition may present in the future remain unclear - especially when it comes to having children - she is determined to not be held back and has even found love with boyfriend Hugh. She said: &quot;We shouldn't feel like we have to hide our bodies. It's our bodies. We were born with them. Let's talk about it.&quot;<br /><br />Follow Paige here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/paigedeangelo/">https://www.instagram.com/paigedeangelo/</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@paige.deangelo">https://www.tiktok.com/@paige.deangelo</a><br /><br />Videographer: Kevin Huang<br />Producers: Erin Cardiff &amp; Yasmin Walker<br />Editor: Jonny Poole<br /><br />Truly is on TikTok! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show">https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show</a><br /><br />Now you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES">http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES</a><br /><br />Click here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! <br />Truly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow">https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow</a><br />Born Different - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/">https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/</a><br />Shake My Beauty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/">https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/</a><br />Hooked On The Look - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/">https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/</a><br />Love Don't Judge - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/">https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/</a><br />Beastly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/</a><br />Ridiculous Rides - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/">https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/</a><br />Dog Dynasty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/</a><br /><br />For more amazing content, click here!<br />Beastly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a>{% endraw %}
