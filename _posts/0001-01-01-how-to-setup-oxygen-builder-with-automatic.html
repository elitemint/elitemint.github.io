{% raw %}7 months ago I recorded a tutorial called How to Setup Oxygen (Best Global Settings). It got 44,000 views and introduced key concepts of fluid responsive typography and spacing.<br /><br />Today, I'm proud to say that tutorial is no longer relevant. You can now install the Automatic.css plugin and start building without worrying about clamp functions, figuring out typography sizes, trying to adjust spacing, etc.<br /><br />Not only will all spacing and typography follow a perfect mathematical scale and be automatically responsive, it's all completely customizable via the Automatic.css plugin dashboard.<br /><br />You also get access to the Automatic.css color system with auto-generated shades and transparencies (also customizable).<br /><br />And of course there's the full utility class and variable system at your fingertips for building sites faster, easier, and more consistent than ever before.<br /><br />Automatic.css is available RIGHT NOW at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://automaticcss.com">https://automaticcss.com</a><br /><br />How is it different and better?

It's mainly designed to help you set up the system and get to building. There's a full setup guide and user's guide in our private ACSS community.<br /><br />Over 1000 people have already purchased and started using Automatic.css in just a week. It's here to stay ... and take over.<br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />2:08 Oxygen Setup<br />8:30 Required Plugin Setup<br />11:07 Building a Simple Landing page<br />12:38 Creating Primary Template<br />22:30 Landing Page Hero<br />27:45 Main Content Section<br />44:25 Color Changes<br />47:55 Typography Changes<br />56:55 Spacing Adjustments<br />1:00:55 Dual Layer Fallbacks{% endraw %}
