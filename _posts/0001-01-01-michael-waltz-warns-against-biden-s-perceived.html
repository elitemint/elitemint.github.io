{% raw %}Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the Biden administration's foreign policy approach, warning if Russia invades Ukraine it could be 'largest land invasion in Europe' since World War II. #FoxNews<br />...<br />MICHAEL WALTZ: Well, we have to appreciate that we're on the verge of possibly seeing the largest land invasion in Europe since World War Two. Russia has hundreds of thousands of its soldiers massed on the Ukrainian border. Cyber attacks are increasing on their electrical grid. The Ukrainians are, as you can imagine, incredibly worried, and we're just not seeing the same sense of urgency out of out of the White House here. Instead, a $200 million lethal aid package is sitting on President Biden's desk. And and folks, I think they're taking the same flawed approach that they took in 2014 where...
