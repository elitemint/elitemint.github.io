I break this up into six categories of training experience: noob, beginner, intermediate, advanced, elite and freak. I have based these strength standards on what I believe are average abilities from my decade plus of coaching experience, data from competitive powerlifting events (including powerlifting records) and existing strength scales from high level strength training coaches. <br /><br />0:00 What makes someone strong?<br />2:45 My current squat, bench and deadlift<br />3:25 NOOB (~3-6 months)<br />4:10 BEGINNER (~0.5-2 years)<br />5:46 Powerbuilding Phase 2.0 info<br />6:02 INTERMEDIATE (~2+ years)<br />7:37 ADVANCED (~2-5+ years) <br />9:37 ELITE (~5-10+ years) <br />10:42 FREAK (~5-10+ years)<br />13:08 Powerbuilding 2.0 info<br /><br />-------------------------------<br /><br />Helpful resources:<br /><br />ExRx 1RM Calculator: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://exrx.net/Calculators/OneRepMax">https://exrx.net/Calculators/OneRepMax</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.strongerbyscience.com/genetics-and-strength-training-just-different/">https://www.strongerbyscience.com/genetics-and-strength-training-just-different/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thestrengthathlete.com/blog/round-table">https://www.thestrengthathlete.com/blog/round-table</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://legionathletics.com/strength-standards/">https://legionathletics.com/strength-standards/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.t-nation.com/training/are-you-strong/">https://www.t-nation.com/training/are-you-strong/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://startingstrength.com/files/standards.pdf">https://startingstrength.com/files/standards.pdf</a><br /><br />Music:<br />Bankrupt Beats:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iN7jlPJhyQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iN7jlPJhyQ</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W5pW9debXM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W5pW9debXM</a><br /><br />Written by: Jeff Nippard<br />Produced by: Jeff Nippard<br />Edited by: Jeff Nippard<br />Filmed by Big 3 Media: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bigthreemedia.com/">https://bigthreemedia.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/big.3.media/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/big.3.media/?hl=en</a><br />Also filmed by RLR Studios: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rlrstudios.ca/">https://www.rlrstudios.ca/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/rlr.studios/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/rlr.studios/?hl=en</a><br /><br />-------------------------------<br /><br />Follow me on social media:<br /><br />INSTAGRAM ‣ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/jeffnippard">http://instagram.com/jeffnippard</a><br />SNAPCHAT ‣ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://snapchat.com/add/jeffnippard">http://snapchat.com/add/jeffnippard</a><br />FACEBOOK ‣ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/jeffnippard">http://facebook.com/jeffnippard</a><br />TWITTER ‣ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/jeffnippard">http://twitter.com/jeffnippard</a><br />PODCAST ‣ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheJeffNippardPodcast">https://www.youtube.com/c/TheJeffNippardPodcast</a><br /><br />-------------------------------<br /><br />About me: I'm a Canadian natural pro bodybuilder and internationally-qualified powerlifter with a BSc in biochemistry/chemistry and a passion for science.
