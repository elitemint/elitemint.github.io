{% raw %}Iso-contouring is a very useful VOI definition technique as it allows careful control of the voxel inclusion threshold, and the search area can be confined to a user-defined boundary. It is particularly useful for PET/SPECT data where there is high tracer uptake in a given region/organ, but it can also be used to segment bone, lungs, or contrast-enhanced-lesions in CT or clear contrast and enhanced areas in MR.{% endraw %}
