{% raw %}“You are gods”? | Bible Problem Passages #3 - John 10:34 - In this video we discuss the oft-repeated statement of Jesus “you are gods” and seek to determine exactly what Jesus meant by it. This inquiry will lead us on quite the journey as we leave no stone unturned to find out the true intent behind the saying. From angels and demons, to false teachers, cults, and the occult, we cover all kinds of ground in the exploration of Jesus' infamous words in John 10:34.<br /><br />The entire Bible Problem Passages playlist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yr6nbfOFOb0&amp;list=PL0ZaautnfUXMiGh_ClhFMSgG1iCCc6UW3\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yr6nbfOFOb0&amp;list=PL0ZaautnfUXMiGh_ClhFMSgG1iCCc6UW3\</a><br /><br />My 2nd Gospel video:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnibaBk1EJA&amp;t=18s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnibaBk1EJA&amp;t=18s</a><br /><br />My secondary channel Christian Video Vault:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/c/ChristianVideoVault">https://youtube.com/c/ChristianVideoVault</a><br /><br />Support the creation of more videos like this by becoming a Patron of my channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/TheophilusMostExcellent">https://www.patreon.com/TheophilusMostExcellent</a><br /><br />As a side note, I encourage my Christian brothers who are interested to examine my Playlists section here on YouTube:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClh6ABQPVkU3N1fD7jb_6yA/playlists">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClh6ABQPVkU3N1fD7jb_6yA/playlists</a><br /><br />I have put together a lot of good material for the believing Christian, esp. the newborn Christian, categorizing it all the best I could.
