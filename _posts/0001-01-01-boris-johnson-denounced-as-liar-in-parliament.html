{% raw %}Ian Blackford, of the SNP, brought a censure motion against Boris Johnson this week for his persistance dishonesty to parliament.

There was no call to withdraw the remark, so the remark, and the wider debate, is now a matter of parliamentary record.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/adifferentbias">https://www.patreon.com/adifferentbias</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Philmoorhouse76">https://twitter.com/Philmoorhouse76</a><br />Clip: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Haggis_UK/status/1465727219288920077?t=I3GIPbxQMf5N00FrIv5FTg&amp;s=03">https://twitter.com/Haggis_UK/status/1465727219288920077?t=I3GIPbxQMf5N00FrIv5FTg&amp;s=03</a><br />Parliamentary record: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-11-30/debates/DA41937F-F795-4A37-8C9E-9940192FBC64/ConductOfTheRightHonMemberForUxbridgeAndSouthRuislip">https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-11-30/debates/DA41937F-F795-4A37-8C9E-9940192FBC64/ConductOfTheRightHonMemberForUxbridgeAndSouthRuislip</a><br />Stefanovic video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/PeterStefanovi2/status/1459541907772780546">https://twitter.com/PeterStefanovi2/status/1459541907772780546</a>{% endraw %}
