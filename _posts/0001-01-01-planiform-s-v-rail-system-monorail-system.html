{% raw %}V-rail systems are used to store and transport garments on hangers. It is an inexpensive non-motorized system. Garments are stored on trolleys that roll on V-rail lines that can be suspended from the ceiling or from a structure. Trolleys can be linked together to create trains that make it possible to easily move higher volumes of garments at a time. For an optimized use of space, the V-rail system can be installed at ceiling level using a motorized booster conveyor that will convey your trolley trains from floor to floor. Moreover, if your building is high enough, your V-rail system can be made of several storage levels.<br /><br />Planiform will provide a turn-key project. Initially, we will have a professional engineer listen to your idea. Then the design will be presented to you for approval. Once approved, the fabrication, installation and commissioning will follow. This will result in a fully integrated and ready to use systemâ€¦not to mention a fully satisfied customer.<br /><br />Visit our website for more details: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.planiform.com/product/v-rails/">https://www.planiform.com/product/v-rails/</a>{% endraw %}
