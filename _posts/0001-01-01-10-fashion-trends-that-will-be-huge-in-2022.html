{% raw %}2022 is less than 3 months away, so that is why I decided to take a closer look into the up and coming trends for spring and summer 2022. It is easy to notice that the Y2K fashion is going to be the IT-trend next year. For example  the low rise pants, platforms, crop tops, miniskirts and the baguette bag (that has been increasing its popularity in 2021!). And then we have some trends that have been sticking around for some seasons, for example cut-outs, fringe, sheer fabrics and crochet. I hope you will enjoy this video and let me know what you think!<br />Video edited by Anna Davidsson, October 2021.<br /><br />Music:<br />ROBY - Acaena<br />Fovos - Cosmos<br />josh pan - Calvin Harris<br />FreeJ - Do You Like Me<br /><br />Video credits:<br />Versace<br />Fendi<br />Miu Miu<br />Burberry<br />Christopher Kane<br />Jonathan Simkhai<br />No.21<br />David Koma<br />Sportmax<br />Tom Ford<br />Paco Rabanne<br />Acne Studios<br />Alberta Ferretti<br />Etro<br />Salvatore Ferragamo<br />Rejina Pyo<br />Missoni<br />Stella McCartney<br />Blumarine<br />Coperni<br />Balmain<br />Proenza Schouler<br />Altuzarra<br />Jacquemus<br />Louis Vuitton<br />Cynthia Rowley<br /><br />I do not own all the material I'm posting on my channel.
