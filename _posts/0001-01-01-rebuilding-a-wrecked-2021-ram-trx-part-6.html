{% raw %}The time has come! We are getting this TRX ready for the paint booth! We have been waiting on parts for a long time and now were waiting on only a few more. We couldn't be happier with how things are flowing so far and here soon it'll all be one color. We also got a few other cool touches in stores and were getting close to installing it all.
