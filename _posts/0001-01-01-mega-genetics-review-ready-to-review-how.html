{% raw %}Ready to review how to do different types of Mendelian and Non-Mendelian Punnett square problems with The Amoeba Sisters? This video reviews one-trait / monohybrid crosses, two-trait / dihybrid crosses, incomplete dominance, codominance, blood type (multiple alleles), and sex-linked / X-linked Punnett square problems and then reviews pedigrees! You can purchase our optional video companion handout here (listed in below description) and expand this video description for more!<br /><br />Table of Contents:<br />00:00 Intro<br />00:42 Five Things to Know First<br />2:37 One-Trait and Monohybrids<br />4:11 Two-Trait and Dihybrids<br />6:18 Incomplete Dominance and Codominance<br />7:54 Blood Type (Multiple Alleles)<br />8:47 Sex-Linked Traits<br />10:34 Pedigrees<br />14:17 Study Tips <br /><br />** OPTIONAL Video Companion Handout **<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Amoeba-Sisters-Mega-Genetics-Review-Video-Companion-KEY-by-Amoeba-Sisters-7377932">https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Amoeba-Sisters-Mega-Genetics-Review-Video-Companion-KEY-by-Amoeba-Sisters-7377932</a><br /><br />** Need help with VOCABULARY in this video? **<br />If you need a refresher, we recommend this glossary of key terms here by the peer-reviewed, free OpenStax Biology Textbook. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://openstax.org/books/concepts-biology/pages/8-key-terms">https://openstax.org/books/concepts-biology/pages/8-key-terms</a><br /><br />** Our heredity playlist (featuring our genetics videos): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwL0Myd7Dk1FVxYPO_bVbk8oOD5EZ2o5W">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwL0Myd7Dk1FVxYPO_bVbk8oOD5EZ2o5W</a><br /><br />**Our complete biology playlist (ALL biology videos): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwL0Myd7Dk1F0iQPGrjehze3eDpco1eVz">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwL0Myd7Dk1F0iQPGrjehze3eDpco1eVz</a><br /><br />**We mention to check out the video description regarding the section about sex-linked traits, as while this portion focuses on sex-linked traits in Punnett squares, there is more complexity to sex determination than sex chromosomes alone. These are some readings we recommended in our sex-linked traits video about this:<br />*About SRY Gene from NIH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SRY">https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SRY</a><br />*About SRY and Sex Determination from Harvard:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2016/im-xy-know-sex-determination-systems-101/">https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2016/im-xy-know-sex-determination-systems-101/</a><br />*What about cases where individuals have different combinations of sex chromosomes, as mentioned in the video? Two examples include Klinefelter Syndrome and Turner Syndrome.

Learning about genetics helps us understand inherited traits in all kinds of organisms including plants (such as crops) and animals (such as humans).<br /><br />For an example of plants, did you know there is a fungus that is threatening the supply of bananas? Learn about how scientists use their knowledge of genetics to address this issue: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02770-7">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02770-7</a><br /><br />For an example of humans, studying genetics helps us understand how our own traits are inherited. We can also help learn about genetic disorders and how they can be treated. Our video mentions the genetic disorder, hemophilia. Did you know gene therapy is being studied in human clinical trials currently?

Did you know there was still a percentage that was not complete in being sequenced?
