Did you know that what you do or don’t do on a regular basis has a huge impact on your overall health? 80% of chronic health conditions such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease can be prevented by following these 5 simple steps.<br /><br />Step One: Maintain a Healthy BMI<br />Maintaining your BMI or Body Mass Index goes well beyond looking fantastic on the beach. Keeping a healthy weight reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, gall bladder disease, diabetes and other chronic diseases. Additionally, people who are overweight have more complications from illness than people who are in a healthy weight range…so it’s best to keep your BMI within the range of 18.5-24.9 for optimal health. <br /><br />Step Two: Avoid Tobacco<br />In this day and age…this one seems like a no-brainer. Over two hundred million Americans choose a smoke free lifestyle! If you don’t use tobacco…congratulations but remember to avoid 2nd hand smoke as well as this is also known to cause cancer. If you do smoke or use other forms of tobacco, it’s never too late…check out our video How to Quit Smoking in the description below.<br /><br />Step Three: Move Move Move<br />Did you know that 60% of American Adults do not get enough regular physical activity? Just 30 minutes of moderate intensity activity, 5 days a week, can significantly reduce your risk of many chronic diseases including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardio vascular disease and even some types of cancer. Getting started is not as hard as you may think. You don’t have to become a gym rat to reap the health benefits of physical activity. Start by simply taking a walk for 30 minutes a day and gradually increase your exercise overtime to benefit even further!<br /><br />Step Four: Eat Your Fruits and Veggies<br />Eating the right foods is a struggle for many of us…however, eating at least five or more servings of fruits and veggies a day is probably one of the best things you can do to help prevent many chronic diseases and can even help reverse some conditions you may already have. If you’re falling short on your fruit and veggie intake, make it easier on yourself by packing several servings to take with you each day. You’re more likely to eat it…if its already in front of you!<br /><br />Step Five: Get Your ZZZZ’s<br />Getting 7-9 hours of sleep a night is increasingly being recognized as an essential aspect of chronic disease prevention. Getting enough ZZZZ’s can help reduce your risk of diabetes, high blood pressure/hypertension, stoke, obesity, depression, and even cancer.
