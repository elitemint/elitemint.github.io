{% raw %}Modern people often think of the Middle Ages as an unsophisticated period, when science and technology were almost unheard of. This is especially true of medieval weapons and warfare. Depictions of medieval warfare often portray it as chaotic and brutal, with two armies bashing away at each other with swords and shields. In reality, medieval warfare could be nearly as complex as it is today. Though medieval and early modern societies didn't have modern advantages like electricity, combustion engines, or industrial manufacturing, they were still capable of producing massive weapons that could devastate the battlefield. <br /><br /><br /><br />#MedievalHistory #Superweapons #WeirdHistory{% endraw %}
