We've managed to compile 15 essential recipes for the perfect summer that won't just help you beat the heat, they're also a real treat for the taste buds!<br /><br />Bookmark Article: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.scrumdiddlyumptious.com/15-sweet-summer-recipes/">https://www.scrumdiddlyumptious.com/15-sweet-summer-recipes/</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching and don't forget to subscribe for a first-hand look at all our best recipes and cooking hacks: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/scrumdiddlyumptious?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/scrumdiddlyumptious?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />******************************************************<br /><br />1.–4. Delicious Watermelon Treats: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/cos5HjvQDvk">https://youtu.be/cos5HjvQDvk</a><br /><br />Watermelon is sweet and fruity, and tastes especially refreshing in the summer. But a plain ol' slice of watermelon, while certainly a classic, can get a little boring, right? Here are 4 tips, tricks, and recipes to help you enjoy this delicious fruit in a whole new way!<br /><br />5. Ice Cream Waffle Cake: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ro5uYhRNVK0">https://youtu.be/ro5uYhRNVK0</a><br /><br />Maybe as a kid you were lucky enough to get waffles and ice cream on special occasions such as your birthday, but those periods in between treats were pure agony. But while waffles à la mode were good and all back then, it's time to enjoy the grownup version of the perfect mix between breakfast and dinner!<br /><br />6. Triple Melon Cake: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ywn_jONIpzE">https://youtu.be/ywn_jONIpzE</a><br /><br />No-bake cakes are hard to come by, and gluten-free ones are even rarer. This melon extravaganza manages to fit both categories, makes for a fresh summer treat, and is probably the lightest cake in the world. If you have a sweet tooth but are still trying to prep your beach bod, now you can have your cake and eat it too! <br /><br />7. Fruity Mexican Paletas: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/B7b5jRD7gNA">https://youtu.be/B7b5jRD7gNA</a><br /><br />While cold snacks are perfect for summer, we say frozen treats should never be tied to the seasons! In fact, we believe they should be enjoyed all year round, and if you want to try something other than the classic strawberry, chocolate, or vanilla ice cream and even make it yourself, be sure to try these delicious fruit bombs! <br /><br />8.

After all, there's never a wrong time to eat fresh fruit, creamy cake, and velvety ice cream, and so much the better when all three are combined into one luscious treat!<br /><br />9. Sparkling Strawberry Melon Slushie: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/j7fxTro0DU8">https://youtu.be/j7fxTro0DU8</a><br /><br />If you want to make the most of your summer vacation, this indulgent slushie is just the thing for staying refreshed.
