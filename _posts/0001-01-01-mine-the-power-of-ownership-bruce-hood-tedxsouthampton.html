{% raw %}Ownership is a peculiar human preoccupation which defines who we are. Ownership controls our lives and yet, very few things have labels on them.

Bruce has written three books for the general public, “SuperSense”, “The Self Illusion” and “The Domesticated Brain”. Bruce has appeared in a number of TV science documentaries and in 2011 he delivered the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures which were broadcast on the BBC to over 4 million viewers. Bruce is the founder of the world’s largest expert speaker database Speakezee.org which he launched in 2015 and continues to grow at a rapid pace<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
