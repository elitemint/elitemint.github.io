{% raw %}► SPONSOR THIS VIDEO: footballdailyuk@gmail.com<br /><br />This week on Euro Football Daily we are exploring some of the biggest trophy droughts you can find in world football. From Universidad de Chile and Santos in South America, to Schalke and Bayer Leverkusen in Germany, some teams just can’t help but fall a the final hurdle. <br /><br />We look at Athetic Club’s heartbreaking back-to-back defeats in the Copa del Rey, Stade de Reims epic former glory, and Genoa’s endless wait for silverware. Then we look at Everton’s disastrous quest for honours, that has seen them splash £450m in the past 5 years, before finishing on Tottenham Hotspur, a club who desperately need a trophy to confirm their giant status! <br /><br />Like and subscribe, and enjoy the video.<br /><br />► SUBSCRIBE to FOOTBALL DAILY PODCASTS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3moyeMO">https://bit.ly/3moyeMO</a><br /><br />► JOIN THE FAN RUN FD FAMILY DISCORD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/KH5YMxA">https://discord.gg/KH5YMxA</a><br /><br />► FOLLOW US ON TWITTER:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/EFDSquad">https://twitter.com/EFDSquad</a><br /><br />► FOLLOW US ON INSTAGRAM: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/efdsquad/">https://www.instagram.com/efdsquad/</a><br /><br />► SIGN UP FOR A FREE SMARTERSCOUT MEMBERSHIP HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://smarterscout.com/">https://smarterscout.com/</a><br /><br />This is Euro Football Daily - the home of European football on YouTube.
