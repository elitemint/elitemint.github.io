{% raw %}It’s soon going to be all over for Xi Jinping.<br />A secure leader is never anxious. And Chinese President Xi Jinping’s rising anxiety says it all about his treacherous political campaign. Amid the orchestrated cacophony around Xi Jinping attempting to cement himself as the leader for life of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), there lies a burgeoning anti-Jinping movement that the world must not give a miss.<br /><br />Xi Jinping’s quest to eliminate his rivals and emerge as the only qualified leader to lead the nation is far from over. Several media reports compiled during the past two to three months indicate a major anti-Jinping movement brewing in the top CCP echelons.<br />Attempts on Xi Jinping’s life:<br />Xi Jinping seems to be living on borrowed time, quite literally. That’s because several incidents involving failed attempts on Jinping’s life have been reported in Chinese media over the past year.<br /><br />On September 13, two major news portals in China published the same article that recapped a CDC “morning brief,” which disclosed that a “sinister gang” within the public security bureau tried to make an attempt on Xi’s life.<br />According to the report, the alleged culprit, Luo Wenjin, was head of the Criminal Police Brigade of the Public Security Bureau of Jiangsu province. He tried to make the attempt when Xi officiated a commemorative function in Nanjing.<br />The CDC brief revealed that Lai Xiaomin, the former head of China Huarong Asset Management Co., was also behind the plot. Interestingly, in January this year, Lai got the death penalty.<br /><br />According to the Epoch Times, Lai was known to have close ties to Zeng Qinghong, the former vice president of China.<br /><br />Mysterious Blasts rocking China before a crucial CCP meeting:<br />Earlier this month, several media reports revealed that about ten explosion accidents had rocked China in just one week from October 21 ahead of the sixth plenary session of the CCP that commenced on November 8 in Beijing.<br />This had also raised serious questions whether these high-intensity bomb blasts, causing several deaths and injuries, were a mere coincidence or did these reflect the staggering level of chaos in the top CCP echelons.<br /><br />Jinping’s growing frustration with the advisory board of the Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management:<br />The advisory board of the Tsinghua University, which has Alibaba’s Jack Ma and former Chair of the China Development Bank Chen Yuan as its members, has remained the main driver of the US-China trade relations over the past decade.<br /><br />However, the advisory group has run afoul of the Chinese administration since the $250 billion phase-1 trade deal happened under the former Trump administration.<br /><br />That explains why the CCP regime has wildly gone after Jack Ma’s Ant group and Chen Yuan over the past year. Even Chinese vice president Wang Qishan, who is believed to wield great influence over the US-China trade relations, is also feeling the heat of Jinping’s rising paranoia.<br /><br />The graft-fighting Central Commission for Discipline Inspection dispatched teams last month to investigate 25 financial companies, including major state-owned banks, in what some observers have suggested maybe a bid to erode Wang’s clout.<br /><br />Tensions run hot between the President and the Vice President:<br />The Chinese President was earlier targeting private enterprises like tech giants and edutech companies. But he is now going after state banks and other financial institutions, in a bid to downsize his lieutenant, Vice President Wang Qishan.<br /><br />The political connection behind Xi’s crackdown on the financial sector directly relates to China’s Vice President Wang Qishan. The Chinese financial sector is seen as the very power base of Vice President Wang Qishan. In fact, Qishan rose to prominence during his stint as the head of the state-owned China Construction Bank Corp., in the 1990s.<br />Brewing #MeToo movement in China:<br />Women enduring the Jinping regime were already up in arms against the repressive policies of the CCP, and now Peng Shuai’s case has vehemently aggravated the situation.<br /><br />Women are now shying away from shouldering responsibilities of raising children and families. China’s birth rate was reported below 1% in 2020, which was the lowest in 43 years. Some believe it is Chinese women’s way to register their protest against the CCP.<br />Fears of another lawyer-led anti-CCP movement send shivers down the spine of Xi Jinping:<br />Now with only a year left for the 20th National Party Congress, coupled with the current economic state of China and its energy crisis, a paranoid Xi Jinping, fearing another lawyer-led anti-CCP (Chinese Communist Party) uprising, is ready to repeat the infamous purges (709 crackdown) of 2015.<br /><br />In the latest move to tighten control over the legal industry in China, the CCP has prohibited lawyers from discussing cases in public.{% endraw %}
