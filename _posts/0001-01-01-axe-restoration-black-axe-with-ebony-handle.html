{% raw %}I used many techniques in the restoration of this rusty axe. With iron (III) chloride and coffee I blackened the rusty axe head. I made the new handle out of ebony, which now revealed a completely black axe. Restoring the old axe I had to grind, file, remove rust, harden, sandblast and saw. This old hand tool I found again on a flea market website and wanted it badly. This video is not only to quickly show someone something, but also to relax and escape from everyday life!<br /><br />▬ What did I do ?! ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ <br /><br />The axe head was extremely rusted, so I removed the coarse rust with rust remover and a screwdriver. The remaining rust I removed with an electrolysis, because the result was not satisfactory I still sandblasted it. Afterwards I made the rough contour with an angle grinder and on the belt grinder I sanded the sides until almost no pitting was visible, up to a grit of 600. In the hardening furnace I now heated the axe to 820°C and quenched it in oil. Before dipping the old hand tool in iron (III) chloride and coffee, I ground the surface to a grit of 1500. The new wooden handle is made of ebony. Now all that was left was to assemble everything and the black axe was ready. <br /><br />▬ Good to know ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ <br /><br />I used the following tools: Wire brush, screwdriver, rust remover spray, angle grinder, laboratory power supply, glass container, test tube, cable ties, side cutters, sandblasting cabinet, abrasive corundum, belt grinder, file, drawing needle, welding helmet, welding machine, sandpaper, orbital sander, hardening furnace, blacksmith tongs, immersion heater, cleaner, wire, iron (III) chloride, steel wool, instant coffee, knife, pencil, scroll saw, Japanese saw, jigsaw, wood file, leather strap<br /><br />▬ Special Thanks to my Members! ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ <br /><br />Debora Richards<br />Zamzuraini Zolkiple <br /><br />▬ Do you want to support me? ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ <br /><br />Would you like to become a channel member?
