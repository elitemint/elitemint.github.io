It has nothing to do with looks, status, or any of the things that women are often accused of valuing over more important traits. There is something about some guys that makes women want to be near them, and explore what might happen if these two got together.<br /><br />Sigma males tend to be strong and silent types. They seldom speak unless they have something important to say, and even though it can make them seem like loners, women find the silence appealing. When sigma men do speak, their words hold weight because there is little excess chaff with their wheat. Women love men who are confident in their skin, and nothing screams confidence like not needing to fight for the spotlight. In fact, when a sigma male does get into the spotlight, it is often just because he wants to have an honest conversation with his friends. It is never about being the center of attention.<br /><br />They are not afraid of commitment. They know that women bring a lot to a relationship, so they are willing to work hard for it. They may not always show it, but they appreciate women and want to make sure that the relationship is a good one.<br /><br />Sigma males have a natural charm that is very appealing to women, but what are the things they do that women can't resist?<br /><br />#sigmamale #sigma #wisethinker{% endraw %}
