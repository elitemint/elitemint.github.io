You get up to investigate, and as soon as you pull the attic ladder down, a swarm of winged-rodents come flying out at you.

What diseases can they transmit to you? Why can turning a light on can help you get rid of the infestation?<br /><br />00:00 Bat Infestation <br />01:33 #1 Seal your house<br />02:15 #2 Save Your Money<br />03:02 #3 Get a shot<br />03:35 #4 Turn the lights on<br />03:56 #5 Wear a Mask<br /><br />Transcript and sources: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whatifshow.com/category/how-to-survive/">https://whatifshow.com/category/how-to-survive/</a><br /><br />Questions or concerns?
