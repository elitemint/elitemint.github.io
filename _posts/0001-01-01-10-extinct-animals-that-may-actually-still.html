Did<br />you know even dire wolves were very real, not just a game of thrones fantasy?<br />But that doesn’t mean you’re out of luck in seeing prehistoric animals today. Researchers now<br />believe that some of the old age animals could still be alive, living in the parts of the world<br />where no one can research. Let’s have a look at 10 extinct animals that may actually still be<br />alive. Number 1 will change your perception of sloths, so watch out for that! let’s begin:<br />Number 10. saber-tooth tiger<br />Let’s start with our favorite creature from the ice age movies. When modern humans first<br />wandered into Europe some 50,000 years ago, this snaggle-toothed cat was probably there to<br />greet them. Until about 10,000 years ago, the saber-tooth tiger was a fearsome predator in what<br />is now the American West. More than 3,000 fossilized cats have been pulled from the acrid ooze<br />of the La Brea tar pits in California. The species is actually much older than thought before;<br />fossil evidence dates it to around 1.8 million years ago. The saber-tooth tiger is remembered with<br />wonder as a relic of the last ice age. Despite its size, weighing in at around five feet long and 440<br />pounds, and its two, seven-inch canine teeth, environmental change, lack of food, and human<br />hunting saw this fascinating beast die off from the face of the Earth. There are various theories<br />on how this creature went extinct, but some researchers believe that it still exists in the colder<br />parts of the world. There has been no proof but the North and south poles are still barely<br />discovered so we can never rule out their existence. If they do exist, we need to be scared as they<br />might take revenge on humans. Are you strong enough to fight this huge beast?<br /><br />Number 9. mokele-mbembe<br />Everyone knows that the dinosaurs died out a while ago — in fact, more than 65 million years<br />ago, give or take. But some people believe that dinosaurs linger on, hiding until the present time<br />in the remote jungles of central Africa, especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The<br />region is the reputed home of the mokele-mbembe, an amphibious dinosaur-like creature said to<br />be up to 35 feet long, with brownish-gray skin and a long, flexible neck. According to legends, it<br />lives in caves it digs in riverbanks, and feeds on elephants, hippos, and crocodiles. There is no<br />real evidence, but some people believe Mokele-mbembe could be the famous loch ness monster.<br />What do you guys think?<br />Number 8. Woolly Mammoth<br />The woolly mammoth lived during the Pleistocene epoch, about 2.5 million to 11 thousand years<br />ago. Its closest living relative is the Asian elephant. In the prehistoric animals’ world, the<br />mammoth is among the best studied. Its behaviors and physical makeup have been looked at<br />quite extensively in comparison to other extinct species. This is all thanks to the discovery of its<br />preserved remains in places like Siberia and Alaska. Researchers have also been able to find its<br />teeth, skeleton, and even both stomach content and dung. Considering such a wealth of<br />information, it’s only natural that scientists will try to revive this beast. To do this, researchers<br />are picking the closest relative alive, the Asian elephant, for what we’d say assistance. What this<br />means is that the genes of the woolly mammoth are introduced in the elephant, giving rise to a<br />close enough replica of the extinct mammal. While the offspring won’t be a true mammoth, it’ll<br />have similar qualities like being cold-blood, a hairy body, and small ears.<br />Number 7. Short-faced bears<br /><br />Bears are already too scary, but there is something else you need to know about their ancestors.<br />About a few hundred million years ago, it was the time of the short-faced bear: the largest bear<br />species that ever lived. They get their name from the shape of their heads: “Because they were<br />“short-faced,” these giant bears had a much stronger bite force than modern bears, even grizzlies.<br />Not just that, when they stood on just their two legs, these gigantic beasts could reach the height<br />of around 11 feet! The modern polar bears only grow up to 1,600 pounds, but their South<br />American cousins are likely to have tipped the scales at 3,500 pounds. Isn&amp;#39;t that just crazy?<br />Native Americans say they have seen short-faced bears and believe they still exist. If they do, we<br />need to be really scared of them!{% endraw %}
