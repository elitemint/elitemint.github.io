{% raw %}2 Mile Long Train Passes Teepee &amp; Castle sitting next to railroad, then crosses Private Railroad Crossing over a driveway!  One of the longest ever mixed freight trains!  This is the Norfolk Southern Railroad in Williamstown, Kentucky on the NS Rat Hole Line.  This is between Cincinnati and Lexington, Kentucky.  The home has its own private railroad crossing but the castle and metal teepee are really cool!  When I first saw the teepee I started thinking to myself about a dream that I had.  I dreamed that I was a wigwam and I dreamed that I was a teepee.   Then I realized that I was too tense.   It's obvious that the teepee isn't real because Indians would not build next to a castle or a railroad line.   They also don't paint their metal teepees.  I found out that the teepee was built by Roy Henry in 1930.   It was used as an office for the castle which was a gas station in the 50s and 60s.  I remember going to small old fashioned country gas stations when I was a kid.  One time back in the 60s we got gas at a gas station near Owensville, Ohio.  It was on Easter and since dad got the car filled up they gave us a free baby chicken!  That was awesome!   My first chicken and it grew up to be a big white rooster.  It followed me everywhere but dad didn't like the crowing.  Anyway, thanks for watching!    <br />Trains use 160.950 and it is very helpful here to also use the EOT frequency which is 452.9375.<br />   Filmed October 21, 2021.
