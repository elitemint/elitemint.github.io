{% raw %}The Downsides of Life in a Rural Cottage - and why I need a change<br /><br />ü¶äüçÑMy Etsy Shop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/thecottagefairyart">https://www.etsy.com/shop/thecottagefairyart</a> (I am closing in late November for the rest of 2021! Thank youüòä I will re open in January 2022)<br /><br />It was time for a change. I have found myself not feeling as satisfied with my current work situation, I lacked a feeling of purpose that I always had before when working with children. As it‚Äôs tricky simply to start a new job short notice, so I will be working in town for the next several months as holiday help and plan from there. It is a much needed shift to a more social environment, and hopefully a greater work/life balance. I find it very hard to divide work from personal life at home, so I think this will have a wonderful affect on my mental health as well.<br /><br />In this video I am sharing some less-than-ideal aspects of living rurally (for me, it may not be the case for someone else). In connection, I wanted to explain why I do not live off grid, and what downsides you may - perhaps - face if you do (which is the reason I live near town). I forgot to mention that I do not have the wish, time to commit, nor the funds to live off grid. It can be very expensive to buy land, build a house, and set up a survival system. I only rent my cottage and am not yet in the position to buy a home, much less build one (the lumber prices lately are insane!). Most people I personally know who live off grid in my valley work remotely so that they can have a flexible schedule, and that is something that I certainly cannot do with my current job. Hope that clarifies things for anyone who was curious!
