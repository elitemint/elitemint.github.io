While cynics feel that lithium-ion batteries that power EVs are a resource that could be milked dry, why bother with Lithium-ion when you can use Graphene and Aluminium. Yes, that's right, there is a new battery on the block, and it's the graphene aluminum battery produced by clean technology firm Graphene Manufacturing Group (GMG). The new battery will feature a chemistry more powerful than Li-ion batteries.<br />Since the time Tesla exploded onto the EV scene, the electric car industry has come a really long way, especially where batteries are concerned. After all, without a battery, the car would just be an empty shell. But even as everything seems to be hunky-dory, the issue of lithium began to arise, well there is a lot of lithium on the earth, and it is an abundant resource, so then what's the problem? Well, extracting it is a long-drawn-out process, and Tesla has even gone on patenting a new procedure using table salt. How they plan on doing that is another story, but word has it that Elon Musk has even purchased his own mine in New Caledonia. Musk also says there is plenty of lithium in Nevada and will use the surroundings of his super factory, the Giga Nevada, to manage the process.<br />But amidst all this comes GMG's fantastic breakthrough, the graphene aluminum battery that is now about to give Tesla and so many other battery manufacturers a run for their money. The company has agreed with industrial giant Robert Bosch to create a battery factory in Australia. But what's all the hype about graphene aluminum batteries?<br />___________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />ü§© The Tesla Domain is the Number 1 channel to go when you want to be up to date with the latest Tesla news, rumors, and insights.
