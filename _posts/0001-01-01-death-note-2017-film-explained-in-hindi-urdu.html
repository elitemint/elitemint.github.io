{% raw %}Death Note (2017) Thriller movie explained in Hindi Urdu. The American Thriller Horror film “Death Note: Angel of Death” story summarized with a complete ending in हिन्दी explanation. The plot is about a high school student, 'Light Turner', who one day finds a black colored book. There are many supernatural and deadly powers in this book. Whose name this boy writes in his notebook, goes away from this world forever. This means that he can kill anyone with his wish. <br />Only he has to write some words on those pages. From this book, there comes the ‘Angel of Death’ who looks like a giant monster, who is fulfilling his words. <br /><br />With his great authority, he begins to eliminate all the bad people present in the world who he thought were not worthy of living. In this aim, a female friend of 'Light' also supports him. But seeing this all happens; an intelligent officer starts chasing them. There are some rules of the Demon of Death as known as Ryuk and his note book, which is also important to follow. <br /><br />I think it is the masterpiece film that the director ‘Adam Wingard’ has shown us marvelously. Its script flow and filmmaking are very entertaining. Even today, this movie seems to be fresh, Mind-Bending and scary. This is one of the best Dark and thrilling stories you'll ever love to watch and listen. I loved the role of actor ‘Willem Dafoe’ who performed the character Ryuk.
