It would cost the Reds £82m to keep the Egyptian superstar until then, by which time he would be 34. So should they pay him what he wants?<br /><br />They also debate whether Raheem Sterling should leave Manchester City for a European giant like Barcelona or PSG, and delve into why West Ham United might actually be the 4th best team in the Premier League right now!{% endraw %}
