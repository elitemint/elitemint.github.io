{% raw %}Spider-Man: No Way Home debuts in theaters on Dec. 17. Spoiler-free review by Amelia Emberwing.<br /><br /><br /><br />Spider-Man: No Way Home hits all the right notes as the MCU's latest entry. Its impact on the universe as a whole, as well as the overall emotional beats, all feel earned. Stellar performances meet what feels like a Saturday morning cartoon rife with all the devastating punches we've come to expect from this sneaky universe. Though it struggles with some tired superhero tropes, everything else about it will leave fans grinning ear-to-ear.<br /><br />#IGN #SpiderMan #Marvel{% endraw %}
