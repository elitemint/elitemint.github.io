We have 60 heads of cattle, mainly simmetal breed and we milk about 35 of them. We farm in a fairly hilly area so our equipment is relatively small. Currently we own 4 tractors: Fiat DT55-56, New Holland TN70DA, Deutz Fahr Agroplus 85 and John Deere 5085M.We work around 20 hectares of mainly grass fields and about 2,5 hectares for silage corn. We also have 7 hectares of forest.{% endraw %}
