{% raw %}Over the last three years we have been working with wonderful community groups, artists and cultural partners to improve life in Sunderland through culture, as part of our Great Place programme.  <br /><br />Great Place was made possible thanks to National Lottery players, funded through Arts Council England and National Lottery Heritage Fund, and with further generous support from Sir James Knott Trust, Sunderland City Council, Washington Area Committee, Sunderland BID, Culture Bridge North East, Sunderland MAC Trust, University of Sunderland, Nexus and The Cultural Spring.{% endraw %}
