{% raw %}In a monologue from episode 29 of Build With Rob, Rob Dyrdek dives into the concept of “energy awareness.” <br /><br />Optimization is where greatness happens. At high optimization, you have incredible energy. Whether it’s work, life or relationships — energy is either taken from you or given to you. It’s important to be aware of this, Rob explains. So how do you build energy awareness? By becoming super sensitive to everything you do on a daily basis, and understanding which experiences provide you the most energy or zapping it away from you. After you become energy aware, you’ll want to optimize it. That’ll lead you to a much higher quality of life, setting you up for success.<br /><br /><br />Subscribe:  @Dyrdek Machine  <br />Website: www.dyrdekmachine.com<br />Instagram: @dyrdekmachine @robdyrdek<br />Twitter: @dyrdekmachine{% endraw %}
