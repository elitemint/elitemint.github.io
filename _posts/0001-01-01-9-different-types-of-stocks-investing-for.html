{% raw %}üëâFREE MASTERCLASS: How To Take Control Of Your Financial Future: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://learn.investdiva.com/yes">http://learn.investdiva.com/yes</a><br /><br />There are 9 different types of stocks that investing beginners need to keep in mind so that you can create an investment strategy that is suitable to your needs, risk tolerance, and personal financial goals. Some of these different types of stocks to invest in can fall into a larger category. But I think it‚Äôs important for beginners to learn investing in stock market by knowing exactly what type of stocks you‚Äôre getting yourself into so that you can have the right expectation and the right financial plan. <br /><br />Also please keep in mind that in this video, I‚Äôm covering different types of common stocks‚Ä¶ and not preferred or unlisted stocks. <br /><br />Common stocks are the most appealing category of stocks because they offer a range of financial potential from current income to growth and capital gain. <br /><br />The 9 different types of stocks include:<br />-Blue Chip stocks<br />- Income stocks<br />- Growth stocks<br />- Tech stocks<br />- Speculative Stocks<br />- Cyclical Stocks<br />- Defensive Stocks<br />- Small-cap stocks<br />- Mid-Cap stocks<br /><br />When I first started investing I simply thought I can buy a stock and wait 20 years for it to grow and then get out. It turns out, there are much better ways to maximize long-term investing. On the flip side,  many traders get in and out of stocks on a daily basis to gain small income profits. <br /><br />By now you probably know that I‚Äôm against day trading for people who‚Äôs main job title doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúprofessional trader‚Äù... and if that‚Äôs what you want to become, then you‚Äôre in the wrong place.<br /><br />But if you‚Äôre looking to grow your money over a longer period of time, and make your money work for you (not the other way around) then you‚Äôre in the right place. <br /><br />Today I‚Äôm going to talk about the 9 types of common stocks, advantages, and disadvantages of each type, and what type of investor each of them is for.<br /><br />GRAB MY INVESTING BOOKS<br /><br />Cryptocurrency Investing for Dummies ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://learn.investdiva.com/cryptocurrency-investing-for-dummies">https://learn.investdiva.com/cryptocurrency-investing-for-dummies</a><br />Ichimoku Secrets ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://learn.investdiva.com/ichimoku-secrets-trading-strategy-ebooko1mfhfr6">https://learn.investdiva.com/ichimoku-secrets-trading-strategy-ebooko1mfhfr6</a><br />Invest Diva‚Äôs Guide to Making Money in Forex ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://education.investdiva.com/free-book-page9529777">https://education.investdiva.com/free-book-page9529777</a><br />Make Your Money Work For You Workbook ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://learn.investdiva.com/workbook">https://learn.investdiva.com/workbook</a><br /><br /><br />Stock brokerage accounts recommended:<br /><br />Robinhood: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://join.robinhood.com/kianad1">http://join.robinhood.com/kianad1</a><br />Webull: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://act.webull.com/kol-us/share.html?hl=en&amp;inviteCode=NoFRNt3luHM8">https://act.webull.com/kol-us/share.html?hl=en&amp;inviteCode=NoFRNt3luHM8</a><br /><br />*** RESOURCES TO MAKE MONEY ONLINE***<br /><br />üëâ How To Take Control Of Your Financial Future  And Make Your Money Work For You: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://learn.investdiva.com/yes">http://learn.investdiva.com/yes</a><br /><br />üëâ How to start an online business: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.alisonjprince.com/0-100kaffiliate?affiliate_id=2317940">https://go.alisonjprince.com/0-100kaffiliate?affiliate_id=2317940</a><br /><br />üëâTurn your knowledge to cash: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://expertsecrets.com/freebook?cf_affiliate_id=475189">https://expertsecrets.com/freebook?cf_affiliate_id=475189</a><br /><br />üëâ How To Grow $500 ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãInto $10,573 Using Invest Diva's Weird Japanese Investing System: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://learn.investdiva.com/yes">http://learn.investdiva.com/yes</a><br /><br />‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÖ FOLLOW ME BELOW: ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÖ<br />üëâ Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://investdiva.com/">http://investdiva.com/</a><br />üìí Facebook (Invest Diva):  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/InvestDiva/">https://www.facebook.com/InvestDiva/</a><br />üê¶ Twitter (Invest Diva): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/InvestDiva">https://twitter.com/InvestDiva</a><br /><br />üìí Facebook (Kiana Danial):  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/KianaDanial/">https://www.facebook.com/KianaDanial/</a><br />üê¶ Twitter (Kiana Danial): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/KianaDanial">https://twitter.com/KianaDanial</a><br />üì∑ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/investdiva/">https://www.instagram.com/investdiva/</a><br />üé¨ TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kianadanial">https://www.tiktok.com/@kianadanial</a><br /><br /><br />***VIDEOS TO HELP YOU MAKE MONEY ONLINE***<br /><br />How to start an online business in 2020 | Alison Prince on Becoming an Online Entrepreneur: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/s9nujhv8PcU">https://youtu.be/s9nujhv8PcU</a><br /><br />I lost my job...
