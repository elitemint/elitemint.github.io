{% raw %}This is a sad poem that is trying to make you feel better.<br /><br />I've been working on this poem for quite some time because I was searching for the correct story to carry this feeling of &quot;endings and beginnings&quot;. The final story that seemed appropriate was this of 2 people that can communicate without language and can understand each other on a deeper level. I hope you enjoy the softness of the final result and the intricacies of human nature that I humbly tried to capture and present. <br /><br />P.S. This wouldn't be possible without my friend and the stray cats that she pets.<br /><br />ðŸ”°Support me on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/illneas">https://www.patreon.com/illneas</a><br /><br />ðŸ”°Find me here ðŸ”—<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/_illneas/">https://www.instagram.com/_illneas/</a><br />                            ðŸ”—<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/illneas/">https://www.facebook.com/illneas/</a><br />                            ðŸ”—<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/illneas">https://twitter.com/illneas</a><br /><br />Second channel<br />ðŸ”—<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3urbsMSDr9XmgtnFdWZe_Q">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3urbsMSDr9XmgtnFdWZe_Q</a><br /><br />ðŸ”°Communities <br />-<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/kfxthmS3F4">https://discord.gg/kfxthmS3F4</a><br />-<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2314655172176122/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/2314655172176122/</a><br />-<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchingformeaning/">https://www.reddit.com/r/searchingformeaning/</a><br /><br />ðŸ”°References <br /><br />-The narrator is Melissa Varela<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/melissa_melicious/">https://www.instagram.com/melissa_melicious/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm6gUUGanHZ6xYJYY0o-Ltg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm6gUUGanHZ6xYJYY0o-Ltg</a><br /><br />-The music is this:<br />LO.OSE - Fragile Feeling<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6O4Oy9xKQfI53K7TKSUA8o?si=G8VjNBcSTCqhMbpc1TKIIg">https://open.spotify.com/artist/6O4Oy9xKQfI53K7TKSUA8o?si=G8VjNBcSTCqhMbpc1TKIIg</a><br /><br />ðŸ”°My equipment: <br />I film handheld with a Panasonic Lumix <br />G80<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2uGqmQZ">https://amzn.to/2uGqmQZ</a><br />GX80<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/33e5Tye">https://amzn.to/33e5Tye</a><br />ðŸ“·Olympus M.Zuiko Digital 45mm F1.8 Lens  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2vr9P3N">https://amzn.to/2vr9P3N</a><br /><br />ðŸ”°If I Die Tomorrow by illness<br /><br />If this was my last day with you<br />I would silently observe the reflection of this room in your eyes <br />Hoping to feel present for the first time <br /><br />If this was my last day here<br />I would break the glass resting on my skin<br />That invisibly separates me from this world<br />And from you<br /><br />If this was my last day with you <br />I wouldn't tell you <br /><br />I would talk to you about my half-finished poems <br />As if I had the courage to write again<br />Hoping someday you will finish them <br /><br />While you might be searching for me <br />Between the lines <br />Or trying to forget me <br /><br />If you notice my voice shaking <br />While talking to you <br />Try to ignore it<br /><br />If you notice my eyes getting blurry <br />Find comfort in your sudden disappearance <br />And wait for gravity to reveal you again <br /><br />If I die tomorrow <br />I would finally realize that the ambient pain <br />Is another proof that I'm still alive <br /><br />You know<br /><br />I know <br /><br />The fragility of everything <br />The fragility of me <br /><br />I know<br /><br />You know<br /><br />That as the sunset approaches<br />Every time you smile <br />I die a little bit <br /><br />I'm sorry <br />I haven't touched you enough<br />You see, I can only say &quot;I love you&quot;<br />In silence<br /><br />You might be angry with me<br />For hiding it from you <br /><br />But all I wanted <br />was another normal day with you<br /><br />If I don't die tomorrow<br />I will live as if I could{% endraw %}
