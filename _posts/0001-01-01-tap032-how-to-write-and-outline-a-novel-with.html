{% raw %}Up until now, I've wanted the seasons of this podcast to be evergreen and act as a resource on how to write a particular element of a story. My desire to create short evergreen episodes focused on a single topic is the reason this podcast tends to be free of interviews. However, throughout season three, I will share short interviews with other writers discussing how they write stories, and in particular, I will try to interview as many writers who &quot;pants&quot; novels. But these interview episodes will be treated as bonus episodes and will not be the focus of the podcast season.<br /><br /><br />In light of that, in this bonus episode,  I chat with Michaelbrent Collings on how he writes and outlines his fiction novels. <br /><br /><br />What to Expect From this Episode<br /><br /><br />In this episode, I chat with Michaelbrent about the following topics:<br /><br />● Where Michaelbrent gets ideas for his books.<br />● How to know whether a horror novel is scary enough for the reader.<br />● Characters in horror movies that are too stupid to live.<br />● Transitioning from having that initial idea to getting to a place where you feel ready to write the first draft.<br />● How much detail Michaelbrent includes when he outlines his novels.<br />●  The trick of becoming a professional author.<br />●  Tips on how to tackle writer's block when you're writing the first draft.<br />●  The trap most authors fall into when writing and measuring success.<br />● Dealing with negative reviews.<br />●  Stores weighing low rating reviews over higher ratings.<br />● Writing is quite emotionally taxing.<br />● The value of a supportive partner or friends.<br /><br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br /><br />⚙️ Podcasts, Books, and Tools Mentioned 🔧<br /><br />Check Out the Show Notes ⇢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://authorpreneurpodcast.com/TAP032/">https://authorpreneurpodcast.com/TAP032/</a><br /><br />The Previous Episode ⇢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://authorpreneurpodcast.com/bts044/">https://authorpreneurpodcast.com/bts044/</a><br /><br />Michaelbrent Collings Website ⇢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://writteninsomnia.com/">https://writteninsomnia.com/</a><br /><br />Michaelbrent Collings Books on Amazon ⇢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Michaelbrent-Collings/e/B003VSI88O%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share">https://www.amazon.com/Michaelbrent-Collings/e/B003VSI88O%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share</a><br /><br />Michaelbrent's YouTube Channel ⇢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MichaelbrentCollingsAuthor/">https://www.youtube.com/c/MichaelbrentCollingsAuthor/</a><br /><br /><br />🔗 Other Useful Links 🔗<br /><br />Try The Formatting Wizard Book Formatting Services for FREE  |  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://levillainbookcovers.com/formatting/beta/">https://levillainbookcovers.com/formatting/beta/</a> **<br /><br />The Formatting Templates offered by my services |  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://levillainbookcovers.com/formatting/templates/">https://levillainbookcovers.com/formatting/templates/</a> **<br /><br />Looking for an affordable premade book cover? | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://levillainbookcovers.com/shop/">https://levillainbookcovers.com/shop/</a>  ** <br /><br />The Book Nerd Red Bubble store | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/WriterADHay/shop">https://www.redbubble.com/people/WriterADHay/shop</a> ***<br /><br />Be on the Podcast | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://authorpreneurpodcast.com/podcast/interview/">https://authorpreneurpodcast.com/podcast/interview/</a><br /><br />The Authorpreneur Podcast Community on Facebook | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/indieauthorpod">https://www.facebook.com/groups/indieauthorpod</a><br /><br />Thinking of writing your first story?
