{% raw %}Filthy rich people buying new cars, new houses, trips to space and giant diamonds are cool...but what about the rooms they build to protect what they care about the most...themselves. One of the biggest growing markets for rich clients is the business of creating safe rooms. These steel-lined, panic rooms with security cameras and alarms might remind you of a Jodie Foster movie but they’re a lot more like staying at a high end hotel today. They feature all the amenities to keep one safe, along with all the comforts to keep one happy.<br /><br />Some homes go well beyond having a safe room though. There are companies that build entire houses that are basically fortresses designed to repel invaders. They feature advanced security systems like instant gas, sealed rooms and even a helicopter pad. Then there are the more kitschy security items that feel like they’re right out of Scooby Doo. These companies make all of the moving bookcases, revolving fireplaces and hidden passages from your childhoods. You just have to be willing to drop thousands of dollars. On the higher end of the danger spectrum are the full blown communities underground that have been built to hide the rich and famous from the apocalypse. They have built an entire underground neighborhood that looks like a high end hotel. It even has a home theatre. So yeah, it’s basically like something right out of a Fallout game. <br /><br />So which of these security features are the most ridiculous?
