{% raw %}The Weeknd made a masterpiece with After Hours. So I, Mintrom Movies felt that I needed to take my time to make this After Hours Video Essay perfect. This is The Darkness of After Hours. This album is incredible, The Weeknd really outdid even himself. From beginning to end After Hours takes you on a journey into the darkness of The Weeknd’s mind, and with this After Hours Video Essay I look into exactly that. What do you guys think of After Hours? It’s definitely my favourite from The Weeknd. Thank you to The Weeknd for this album and thank YOU for watching. Much love. <br /><br />Timestamps:<br />0:00 - Prologue<br />0:44 - Addicted<br />3:52 - Ghosts of Lovers Past<br />7:09 - Fear of Self<br /><br />Music by Soul Surplus.<br /><br />#TheWeeknd #AfterHours<br /><br />► Subscribe to Mintrom Movies: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW_vRksS8q0MAxZHhfemueA/featured">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW_vRksS8q0MAxZHhfemueA/featured</a><br /><br />Follow Mintrom Movies:<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mintrommovies">https://twitter.com/mintrommovies</a><br /><br />Watch More Mintrom Movies:<br />Popular Videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW_vRksS8q0MAxZHhfemueA/videos?view=0&amp;sort=p&amp;flow=grid">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW_vRksS8q0MAxZHhfemueA/videos?view=0&amp;sort=p&amp;flow=grid</a><br /><br />Welcome to Mintrom Movies!
