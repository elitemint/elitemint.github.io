{% raw %}In this video, you'll learn about one of the ways that we use our resources in an environmentally conscious, sustainable manner! <br /><br />Join Steve from Our Sustainable Journey as he walks us through the way that we use waste from our Hemp processing practice to create food for earthworms, who then produce valuable fertilizer! We then use this excellent, all-natural fertilizer to keep feeding our crops to make them happy and healthy. This process means that we minimize the waste in our production; recycling spent Hemp to help grow even more beautiful, healthy crops!<br /><br />Check out our webpage to learn more about our sustainable food practices, and how we're working to provide clean, natural nutrition to the world!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://keyleaf.ca/">https://keyleaf.ca/</a>{% endraw %}
