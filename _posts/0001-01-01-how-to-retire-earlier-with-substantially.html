{% raw %}If you want to retire early and use your retirement accounts then in this video I'll explain how to take the money out without the additional 10% early withdrawal penalty.  The substantially equal periodic payments also known at the 72(t) distribution rule may allow you to create an income stream before reaching the age of 59.5. <br /><br />Use the simple but effective 72(t) rule to avoid paying the penalty and withdraw your money earlier.  The 72(t) withdrawal rule is a lesser known rule that you can actually retire earlier with substantially equal periodic payments without the early withdrawal penalty.<br /><br />The substantially equal period payments is a fancy way of saying you're creating an income stream with your retirement plan where the IRS will waive the early withdrawal penalty.<br /><br />ðŸ’¸ FOR MORE FINANCIAL PLANNING &amp; ASSET MANAGEMENT ðŸ’¸<br /><br /><br />Book a meeting and start financial planning and investing<br />bit.ly/SickleHunterOnline<br /><br />Try out our financial planning tool today.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://travissickle_youtube1.gr8.com/">https://travissickle_youtube1.gr8.com/</a><br /><br /><br />Get help with your investments and financial planning here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/3b1NCZc">http://bit.ly/3b1NCZc</a><br /><br />Book a free appointment with our team <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/SickleHunterOnline">https://bit.ly/SickleHunterOnline</a><br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------<br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLoIaI_vPPWX47TamcxtP_A/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLoIaI_vPPWX47TamcxtP_A/join</a><br /><br />If you have a little or a lot we can help.<br />START HERE <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2Fo21Ry">http://bit.ly/2Fo21Ry</a><br /><br />Payroll Provider<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ubZYra">https://bit.ly/3ubZYra</a><br /><br />PPP Loan Application <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ssqt.co/mzjceFS">http://ssqt.co/mzjceFS</a><br /><br />TRAVIS T SICKLE, CFPÂ®, EAÂ®, AAMSÂ®, CRPCÂ®, RICPÂ®<br />CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNERâ„¢<br /><br />PODCAST <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3d0PBjO">https://bit.ly/3d0PBjO</a><br />Company Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sicklehunter.com">https://www.sicklehunter.com</a><br />twitter: @travissickle<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/travistsickle">https://www.instagram.com/travistsickle</a><br />facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/SickleHunterFA">https://www.facebook.com/SickleHunterFA</a><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/travissickle">https://www.linkedin.com/in/travissickle</a><br /><br />Sickle Hunter Financial Advisors<br />1646 W Snow Ave.<br />Suite 144<br />Tampa, FL 33606<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Gear Used in Videos <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3bUPvXP">https://bit.ly/3bUPvXP</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: This video and description contain affiliate links, which means that if you click on one of the product links, weâ€™ll receive a small commission.<br /><br />#travissickle<br /><br />#travissickle{% endraw %}
