{% raw %}Alters are part of a psychological defence mechanism formed from childhood trauma and disorganised attachments. They are the hallmark symptom for dissociative identity disorder (DID) and although they are formed from those experiences, we have ensured to simply keep living and have a little fun while we’re at it! <br /><br />Alters can have different names, gender, beliefs and experiences that make them individual, and although for most cases, most alters are far less “unique” from one another than ours, we still wanted to represent how this disorder looks for us :) (bear it in mind if you were to ever meet someone else with this disorder that their alters may be more subtle than ours!)<br /><br />Read more about the disorder at: did-research.org or Positive Outcomes for Dissociative Survivors (PODS)<br /><br />#dissociativeidentitydisorder #mentalhealth #psychology<br /><br />Video edited by @james_ryall20 <br />Puzzle art by @mjtotoro<br /><br />—-<br /><br /><br />Self-help:<br />Even if it's online, try taking the time out to talk:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://betterhelp.com/multiplicity">https://betterhelp.com/multiplicity</a><br /><br />Social Media:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/multiplicityandme">https://www.facebook.com/multiplicityandme</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/multiplicityandme">https://www.instagram.com/multiplicityandme</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/multiplicityand">https://twitter.com/multiplicityand</a><br /><br />Tumblr: www.multiplicityandme.tumblr.com<br /><br />Tumblr (the alters): www.multiplicityandwe.tumblr.com<br /><br /><br /><br />Support:<br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/multiplicityandme">http://www.patreon.com/multiplicityandme</a><br /><br />Wishlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.eu/ixnmvek">http://amzn.eu/ixnmvek</a><br /><br /><br /><br />P.O.
