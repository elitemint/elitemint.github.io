They highlight that although Evergrande wasn’t analogous to what many dubbed “The Lehman Moment” a more apt analogy could be “The Bear Stearns Moment” that proceeded Lehman’s collapse, and that if China does intend to follow through with deflating their real estate bubble a national victory in the form of reunification with Taiwan could offset some of the economic pain.<br /> <br />Watch the new series of ‘The Short of It’ on Zer0esTV and learn just how crazy markets can get from the biggest names in the business. <br /><br />Find out more by visiting the home of short-selling: www.zer0es.tv  <br />About Real Vision™: <br />Real Vision is the destination for the world’s most successful investors to share their thoughts about today's markets.<br />Real Vision helps you understand the complex world of finance, business and the global economy with real in-depth analysis from real experts. <br />Subscribe now for more videos like this one: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rvtv.io/2OW3mqu">https://rvtv.io/2OW3mqu</a>   <br />Become a member of Real Vision -- get started for 7 days for only $1: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rvtv.io/membership">https://rvtv.io/membership</a>  <br />Disclaimer:<br />This video content is intended for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.
