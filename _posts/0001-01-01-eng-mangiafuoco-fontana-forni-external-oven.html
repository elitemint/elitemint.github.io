{% raw %}Mangiafuoco. Oven with 60Ã—80 cm cooking chamber. The fire surface is made of high quality refractory chamotte, certified for food use. The internal structure is in stainless steel, while the external one is in electrogalvanized steel treated with paints at high temperature for the maximum resistance to heat, weather and rust. The insulation of the oven is made of natural rock wool and it allows to maintain temperature more efficiently and to avoid that the external structure becomes too hot.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fontanaforni.com/en/portfolio/external-oven/mangiafuoco/">https://fontanaforni.com/en/portfolio/external-oven/mangiafuoco/</a>{% endraw %}
