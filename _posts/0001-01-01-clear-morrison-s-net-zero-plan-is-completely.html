{% raw %}Sky News host Alan Jones says it is “clear” Scott Morrison’s net zero emissions plan is “completely un-costed”.<br /><br />“In fact, a motion before the Senate last week by Senator Rex Patrick and Senator Matt Canavan called for the production of documents relevant for the net zero modelling,” Mr Jones said.<br /><br />“Now the government is refusing to release the modelling and claiming public interest immunity.<br /><br />“There is no doubt that the net zero emissions fever seems to have been captured by everybody with the potential to affect everybody.”{% endraw %}
