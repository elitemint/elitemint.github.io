{% raw %}The Tesla Roadster was the car that proved electric cars had a chance and brought<br />Tesla to the world's attention! After retiring the electric super car in 2012, Tesla has<br />brought back the Roadster! But where is Tesla making these speed demons?<br />Join us as we go inside Tesla's new Roadster factory!<br />If any discontinued car deserves to come back, it is the Tesla Roadster! With the kind of<br />legacy associated with it, this car deserves a second chance and has fans eagerly<br />waiting for it!<br />Tesla set out to prove that electric power and high performance need not be mutually<br />exclusive and did so convincingly.<br />First revealed as a concept car in 2006, the drivable prototypes started to show up the<br />following year. Tesla began manufacturing the convertible Roadster in 2008. For nearly<br />$100,000, early buyers were treated to a combination of supercar speed and sailboat<br />sound levels and still smirk each time they drove past a filling station. It was a pleasure<br />to charge at home, and in those early days, the Roadster would make soft gurgling<br />sounds as the propylene-glycol coolant circulates through the battery pack and the<br />radiators. Sometimes, the cooling fans would kick in.<br />The two-seater Roadster was a breakthrough in automobile battery technology with<br />more than 200 miles of driving range. This was thanks to a massive lithium-ion battery<br />pack, a novelty at that time, with liquid cooling, safety fuses, and sophisticated software<br />that made it safe to work in a performance car.<br />Tesla had some help from British auto company Lotus in the styling of the Roadster. But<br />the electric car had its own distinct features, like weight distribution. Apart from this,<br />almost all of the Roadster's components were specialized.<br />The original Roadster weighed about 2700 pounds, but it was easily handled by the<br />electric motor capable of 248 horsepower and 200 pound-feet of torque.<br />It also had a touchscreen that reported the miles remaining in the battery. The cabin<br />was  well  made  with a  glossy carbon-fiber center  console,  with  cabin-temperature<br />controls, seat heaters, and air condition buttons. It definitely looks ancient in comparison<br />with today's Teslas!<br />But of course, those early buyers were attracted to the speed, gleefully leaving other<br />cars behind when the traffic light turned green!<br />Interestingly,   some   early   adopters   feared   they   could   be   stuck   with   a   fancy   and<br />expensive paper weight should Tesla go under! But of course, we know their fears were<br />unfounded now that Tesla has become a trillion-dollar company that sells the highest<br />number of purely electric cars globally!<br />Tesla made and sold less than 2,500 units of these speed machines before ending<br />production in 2012 to focus on the more reasonably priced Model S. But it was enough<br />to cement the Roadster's place in history.<br />The original Roaster will reach places that most other cars will never reach, as SpaceX<br />launched Musk's personal Roadster to deep space in February 2018 atop the Falcon<br />Heavy rocket in a test flight.<br />While announcing the discontinuation, then Tesla spokesperson, Khobi Brooklyn, said:<br />&quot;The Roadster will always be the cornerstone of Tesla, and we look forward to bringing<br />back a version of the supercar that takes full advantage of our advanced electric<br />powertrain in the next several years.&quot;<br />Brooklyn's words are coming true as Tesla has brought back the Roadster! It has<br />undergone a total makeover but still retains the exciting performance of the original<br />Roadster.<br />This new Roadster features a slicker design with prominent curves that brings it closer<br />to modern Tesla cars. The body has been styled for high performance and aero<br />efficiency.<br />It is more powerful than ever, with a blazingly fast acceleration time of 1.9 seconds from<br />0 to 60 miles per hour! It will reach a top speed of over 250 miles per hour, making it the<br />world's fastest production car!<br />If that speed is not enough for you, there is a faster version that Tesla is fitting with the<br />SpaceX Package that will sprint from 0 to 60 miles per hour, as confirmed by Musk<br />himself! This version has cold gas thrusters for zooming!<br />Show this tweet:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1395474465794838528?s=20">https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1395474465794838528?s=20</a><br />Even Musk is concerned about the speed and recommends that people with a medical<br />condition stay away from it!<br />The range is more than double of the original version, with 620 miles on a single<br />charge. Musk said it would get a massive 200 kWh battery to help it put other electric<br />vehicles to shame.<br />The Roadster has gained two extra seats in this generation, although it remains a door-<br />door car. You will be able to bring more people along on your hair-raising rides!<br />The glass roof is still removable and can be stored in the trunk for when you want to feel<br />the wind in your hair on the road.<br />You can't have all that upgrades and expect the price to remain the same. This new<br />Roadster starts at a cool $200,000. There is a Founders Series version that starts at<br />$250,000.{% endraw %}
