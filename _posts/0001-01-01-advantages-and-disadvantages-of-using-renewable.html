{% raw %}Renewable energy, often called clean energy, comes from natural sources or processes that are constantly replenished, such as sunlight, wind, rain, rides, waves, and geothermal heat. While these are typically seen as very advantageous because they are natural and don't run out, there are advantages and disadvantages to many things. First, let's export the advantages of renewable energy.<br /><br />See the Alternative Energy Lesson Plans Middle School in my store:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Renewable-Energy-Google-Slides-Hyperdoc-6379814?utm_source=renewable%20video%20youtube&amp;utm_campaign=youtube">https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Renewable-Energy-Google-Slides-Hyperdoc-6379814?utm_source=renewable%20video%20youtube&amp;utm_campaign=youtube</a><br /><br />Visit the blog post for Renewable Energy Sources Lesson Plan<br /> on Dynamic Earth Learning's Blog:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dynamicearthlearning.com/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-renewable-energy/">https://dynamicearthlearning.com/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-renewable-energy/</a><br /><br />Advantages of Renewable Energy<br />Unlike nonrenewable energy, renewable energy sources will never run out. Renewable energy technologies use resources straight from the environment to generate power, making them sustainable and abundant natural resources. Another advantage is that renewable energy saves maintenance and operating costs. Renewable energy facilities generally require less maintenance than traditional generators, like fuel-powered engines. When you're using a technology that generates power from the sun, wind, steam, or natural processes, there is no need to refuel.<br />A big advantage is that renewable energies don't damage our planet. They produce minimal or no waste products and don't contribute to global warming. This means an overall positive impact on the natural environment. Finally, there are many economic benefits to many regional areas. Most renewable energy projects are located in regional areas - far away from the big cities. These are all great advantages of renewable energy!<br /><br />Renewable energy has many benefits, but have you ever wondered what can be the disadvantages of using renewable resources? Here are some disadvantages to using renewables over traditional energy generation.<br /><br />Disadvantages of Renewable Energy<br /><br />First, the electricity generation capacity is still not large enough. It's difficult to generate the quantities of electricity compared to traditional forms of energy generation like fossil fuels. This may mean that we need to reduce the amount of energy we use, or just build more energy facilities. This also shows that the best way to solve our energy problems may be to balance<br />many different power sources. Additionally, unreliable weather can affect the energy supply of renewable energy. Some days may be windier than others, the sun doesn't shine at night, and droughts may occur for periods of time. There can be unpredictable weather events that disrupt these technologies. When these resources are unavailable, so is the capacity to make energy from them. Finally, renewable energy requires a huge financial outlay. The current cost of renewable energy technology is also far in excess of traditional fossil fuel generation. Currently, the cost of<br />renewable energy technologies far exceeds traditional fossil fuel power generation.<br /><br />So like most things, there are both Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Renewable Energy. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages? It's important to reflect on ways that we can better take care of our planet while looking at all angles of the situation!<br /><br />Should you be Using Renewable Energy? #middleschool  #distancelearning #onlinelearning #homeschool #virtuallearning #earthday #sustainabilityeducation #scienceteacher #middleschoolscience{% endraw %}
