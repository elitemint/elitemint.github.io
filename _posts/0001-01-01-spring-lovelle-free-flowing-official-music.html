{% raw %}In a world that is always telling you who to be…how about just be yourself?  Imperfect, beautifully flawed and human. A playground, a tripod, a camera and me - was a fun day of work that felt like play!   May we all live like that everyday. <br /><br />Song and video written, performed, produced and edited by Spring Lovelle<br /><br />Get the single “Free Flowing” at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.springlovelle.com">http://www.springlovelle.com</a><br /><br />Join Spring on <br />Facebook:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/springlovelle">https://www.facebook.com/springlovelle</a><br />Instagram:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/springlovelle/">https://www.instagram.com/springlovelle/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/springlovelle">https://twitter.com/springlovelle</a><br /><br />LIKE &amp; SUBSCRIBE to Spring Lovelle YouTube Channel<br /><br />LYRICS <br />I came into this world a curious child <br />My eyes wide open and feeling so alive <br />I was taught be a good girl <br />And I lost myself in a crazy world <br />The years of people pleasing wore me down<br />I had to stop thinking like the crowd <br />so I could stand on my own and shout out loud <br /><br />Free Flowing and loving life <br />Nothing gets me down when I’m feeling this light I’m<br />Free Flowing I found the charm of living each day <br />My own way I’m<br />Free Flowing make no excuse <br />For who you are and what you do <br />Just keep singing Free Flowing<br /><br />The bar got raised a little too high <br />I’d try and fail and then fail to try <br />But no one can live their life that way <br />And wanna wake up every day <br />So I gave up perfection ‘cause it’s more fun <br />Drawing outside the lines goofing off in the sun <br />Yeah I’m the lucky one to be<br /><br />Free Flowing and loving life <br />Nothing gets me down when I’m feeling this light I’m<br />Free Flowing I found the charm of living each day <br />My own way I’m<br />Free Flowing make no excuse <br />For who you are and what you do <br />Just keep singing Free Flowing<br /><br />I laugh until I cry<br />Feel that joy deep down inside <br />I’ve shaken off the need to judge where I’ve been <br />That would be squandering the precious moment <br />Life‘s a wild ride there’s no race to get it done <br />Just let it go and have some fun <br /><br />Free Flowing and loving life <br />Nothing gets me down when I’m feeling this light I’m<br />Free Flowing I found the charm of living each day <br />My own way I’m<br />Free Flowing make no excuse <br />For who you are and what you do <br />Just keep singing Free Flowing{% endraw %}
