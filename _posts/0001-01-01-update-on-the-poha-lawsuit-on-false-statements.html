{% raw %}Join <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://t.me/healingthedividenews">https://t.me/healingthedividenews</a> on telegram for more updates.<br /><br />We have been updated by the legal representative (mother) of the 9 year old boy (Claimant) on the false statement lawsuit on Mr Ong Ye Kung. She just had her first Court Hearing with regards to her &quot;false statement&quot; lawsuit on Mr Ong Ye Kung.<br /><br />Basically good news, the Court determines that the proceeding can go on, and she has to serve notice on Mr Ong Ye Kung.<br /><br />The main points are as follows;<br /><br />1) There is a gag order issued not to reveal the identity of the Claimant (about 1230pm on 31 Dec 2021), as the Claimant is a 9 year old child. This is to protect all children who are part of a court proceeding in all Courts.<br /><br />This must be complied by all parties, including all parties in this group and beyond. Anyone who knows the identity of the child is bound by the gag order hereafter. You are not allowed to publicise further that would reveal the child's identity. Failing which, anyone may be subject to contempt proceedings.<br /><br />2) There is a question on whether Mr Ong Ye Kung can be taken to Court for he has immunity as a Member of Parliament and Minister of Health. <br /><br />The points raised to Court is that Mr Ong Ye Kung was making the alleged false statement in his facebook page. He was making those alleged false statements as a private citizen and not as a Member of Parliament nor as a Minister of our great country.<br /><br />His facebook page is not an official government communication channel of the government.<br /><br />He is speaking as a private citizen in his own personal page.<br /><br />The view is that parliamentary immunity should not apply to a Ministerâ€™s private life and alleged false statements that he may make in his own personal life. The claimant should be able to sue Mr Ong Ye Kung in a Court of Law.<br /><br />The Court agrees with that view.<br /><br />3) The claimant's legal representative (mother) has been instructed by the Court to serve notice on him.<br /><br />Updates as they come - we can give updates, we just cannot reveal the identity of the child.{% endraw %}
