{% raw %}Another calm and relaxing piano music session. Might work as focus or study music, as a stress relief soundtrack, a tune for your day, as music while reading, writing, designing, coding, reflecting, getting things done, for in the evening when winding down for a healthy sleep, or just as a tune to relax and enjoy.<br /><br />Title: Where Is The Path? | Type: original fantasia piano music session<br /><br />Itâ€™s simple. Iâ€™m struggling with my personal CO2 footprint. The heating of my living/work space part. Living in Germany, with relatively cold winters we use lots of energy to heat the houses we live in. In most cases. Especially true with the older houses that are not isolated to most modern standards. So the CO2, or CO2 equivalent gases that are released to heat the space I live and work in, thatâ€™s what bothers me right now. A lot. Iâ€™m not done with exact calculations, but I realized itâ€™s way too much. Probably 6 tons CO2 per year that I could avoid. I want to be a good human being, one that cares for the planet and any future life on it. I just became aware Iâ€™m not. This makes me sad.<br /><br />And instantly I want to do something about it. And I know I can. I donâ€™t blame anyone or show fingers on anyone. I blame myself. I chose this place and constellation, I rent this space, itâ€™s up to me to do better. But itâ€™s not as easy as buying a new pullover, a bicycle, or any product thatâ€™s easily available today. You donâ€™t switch living situations that easily, especially not if your goal is to live a super tight CO2 footprint lifestyle (not so many energy-superefficient houses on the rental market), and you donâ€™t have a gazillion Dollars or Euros in your pockets (to build your own). Circumstances and some sort of luck led me to be in a way too large space for over a year now. But only now I realized what this means for my personal footprint, how much CO2 equivalent  gases I add to the atmosphere this way, and my impact on our global man-made climate change.<br /><br />I've been deep into the topic for a couple weeks now, analysing the CO2 footprint of my space, how the numbers would be if I would share the space with others, and how the numbers would be with different sorts of other theoretical housing/living situations.<br />So, one idea is to share the space. A space basically uses the same amount of heating energy no matter whether one, or five live in it. So having five people in here would cut my footprint in the heating area about 80%. Thatâ€™s something I could live with. My other areas, electricity, mobility, food, consuming stuff are already OK to great, with some still improvable. But that housing/heating one is a no go with my current situation.<br /><br />Renting and moving to a small, very well isolated house/apartment is also an option. As well as building one by myself. Or buying a small old one and bring it up to most modern energy efficient standards. Or, moving to a country where there are no cold winters and no hot summers, and get a space there. All options are not an easy route. I just began feeling home here. Weâ€™re building friendships and a good community here in our street. I think thatâ€™s worth so much and Iâ€™m not sure I will be part of something like it ever again, if I move. For buying and building there are financial reasons that make them unlikely options.<br /><br />But I know I can find a way. I feel it. Actually I feel a 4 tons CO2/ year lifestyle would be OK. Quite tough to realize here. In Germany most do something between 8 and 20, with about 11 on average. I know I can do 6 flat here easily, maybe a 5, when living very CO2 consciously and a mostly by foot and bicycle lifestyle. My heart tells me: You can get there. You can make this happen. You Can Make It.<br /><br />Is there a project in your life right now thatâ€™s tough on you, one you feel it requires lots of energy, thought, willpower, change, maybe even a bit luck, one you know will not happen if you donâ€™t fight for it?<br /><br />I also hope you enjoy the music. <br />Stay healthy and wonderful!<br />Michael (relaxdaily*)<br /><br /><br />ðŸ§¡ Download the music and help me creating more:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/59388527">https://www.patreon.com/posts/59388527</a><br /><br />ðŸ“º Find all my ambient tunes and piano music sessions here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/relaxdaily">https://www.youtube.com/relaxdaily</a> (tick the bell when subscribing if you want to be notified by YouTube about my latest videos)<br /><br />Thank you for listening and creating own playlists also on: <br /><br />ðŸŽ§ @ Spotify <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3F1cI520nPOLkjvHd2k7iz">https://open.spotify.com/artist/3F1cI520nPOLkjvHd2k7iz</a> <br /><br />ðŸŽ§ @ Apple Music<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://music.apple.com/artist/relaxdaily/494543884">https://music.apple.com/artist/relaxdaily/494543884</a> <br /><br />...and selected music services, like YouTube Music, Amazon, Deezer...<br /><br /><br />Some of my YouTube playlists (save for updates):<br /><br />â˜° Calm Piano: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOzlQzU-yr67GDMoL_vHqpXAWIoEoix6k">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOzlQzU-yr67GDMoL_vHqpXAWIoEoix6k</a> <br /><br />â˜° The Singles: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAE6EB41B485F610A">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAE6EB41B485F610A</a> <br /><br />â˜° Deep Focus: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOzlQzU-yr65nTKt7tEbHBnnd0AiGJoqZ">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOzlQzU-yr65nTKt7tEbHBnnd0AiGJoqZ</a> <br /><br />Â© music &amp; video (2021) relaxdaily.net<br />...stay wonderful!<br /><br />#piano #relaxingmusic #calmpiano{% endraw %}
