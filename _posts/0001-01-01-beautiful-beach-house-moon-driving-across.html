{% raw %}WHAT A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT AT OUR BEACH HOUSE IN CATEEL, DAVAO ORIENTAL!  <br /><br />After enjoying some moments with the full moon.  I woke up and headed down the coast towards Mati.  Driving across the Province of Davao Oriental is always relaxing, and well, full of beauty.  This video takes a little look at some of the coastal towns that I pass through driving across the Province.  We check out one of the oldest churches in Mindanao found in Caraga.  Stop for some food and take a look at the river in Manay, then climb up a beautiful mountain side ridge in Tarragona. <br /><br />The Province of Davao Oriental is wonderful for exploring, driving, living and well...<br /><br />LIFE. <br /><br />From our incredible beach house in Davao, to all the small towns along the coast.  The province life is beautiful!<br /><br />Power On!<br /><br />*** NEW #BecomingFilipino Drone Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2H-T...">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2H-T...</a><br /><br />*** FOR HAMMOCKS AND SHIRTS JUST MESSAGE VIAJERO OUTDOOR CENTER ON FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://web.facebook.com/viajerocdo/">https://web.facebook.com/viajerocdo/</a><br /><br />*** FOR MORE STORIES AND ADVENTURES CHECK OUT MY FACEBOOK PAGE: #BecomingFilipino{% endraw %}
