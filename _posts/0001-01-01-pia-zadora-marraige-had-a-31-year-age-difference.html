{% raw %}Zadora married businessman Meshulam Riklis in 1977, when she was 23 and he 54.  <br />Zadora and Riklis bought the Beverly Hills mansion Pickfair Manor in January 1988 from Los Angeles Lakers owner Jerry Buss for almost $7 million. They demolished most of the structure while keeping the guest houses, claiming that termites and time had made repairs difficult. The mansion, which drew its name of &quot;Pickfair&quot; from having once been the shared home of Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, was torn down and a new 25,000-square-foot mansion was built on the property. Zadora later claimed  that Pickfair was razed due to a troubling apparition which appeared to her and children when her husband was away on business. Riklis commissioned a nude oil portrait of Zadora, which greeted visitors.<br />Zadora and Riklis divorced in 1993, and Zadora remained in the mansion until late 2005 or early 2006, when she sold it to Korean businessman Corry Hong for $17,650,000.<br /><br />Pia came to national attention in 1981, when following her starring role in the highly criticized] Butterfly, she won a Golden Globe Award as New Star of the Year, and simultaneously winning the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress and the &quot;Worst New Star&quot; for the same performance.{% endraw %}
