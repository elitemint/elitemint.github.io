{% raw %}Is Live Nation responsible for the Astroworld tragedy? <br /><br />Is this man responsible for the Astroworld Travis Scott tragedy.  Some are saying that Michael Rapino of Live Nation bears more responsibility than Travis Scott.<br /><br />A brother named Keith Major Sr wrote this note regarding Scott and Rapino:<br /><br />This is Michael Rapino, the guy that owns LiveNation.  I continue to see headlines that say &quot;Travis Scott's Concert Tragedy.&quot;  Correction, it was NOT Travis Scott's concert.  The official name of the event was &quot;Astroworld Festival 2021&quot; sponsored by Live Nation Worldwide and Scoremore Holdings LLC.  It was a two-day event with a combined capacity of 100,000 people.  There were 22 total performers.  Travis Scott was simply the unlucky guy who happened to be on stage when tragedy struck.<br /><br />The point.  It wasn’t Travis Scott’s show.  It was LiveNation’s show.  Travis Scott got paid to perform.  None of the people in charge of the event were Travis Scott’s people.<br />  <br />This ain’t on Travis Scott.  This is on LiveNation.  When you assume all the authority, you assume all of the responsibility.  Michael Rapino is about to get the brakes sued off of him.  But it's sad that he continues to hide in the shadows content to watch Travis Scott get drug trough the mud.<br /><br />I saw the Chief of Police in a press conference saying that it's ultimately up to the artist to stop the show.  But let's be honest, if Travis Scott had stopped the show and walked off the stage averting tragedy, would Michael Rapino have still paid him his money?  <br /><br />And lastly, I saw a lawyer lady on TV saying that you may think that Travis Scott had a moral and ethical obligation to do something, but that's not what's going to get argued in court.  Did Travis Scott have a legal obligation to do something?  According to her, the answer to that is probably &quot;no.&quot;    <br /><br />The current reporting is tantamount to a riot breaking out at AT&amp;T Stadium and the media blaming the tragedy on Dak Prescott.  &quot;Dude!  Dak ain't responsible for security!&quot;   <br /><br />It's a shame that Rapino is content to sit idly by and watch Travis Scott get drug through the mud.  And it's irresponsible for the media to distort the reporting. #fakenews<br /><br />If you want to solve a crime, follow the money and look for the person waiting to get paid.<br /><br />I guarantee you that Rapino has already lawyered up...<br /><br />Is Live Nation responsible for the Astroworld tragedy?<br /><br />Tags used for this video: <br />#travisscott,astroworld,tragedy,death,concert,travis Scott concert,rappers,entertainment news,breaking news,live entertainment,sue,lawsuit,court,lawyer,prison,victims,trampled on,drugs,fnq,black women,black rappers,artist,music industry,business,insurance,Is Live Nation responsible for the Astroworld tragedy?<br /><br />#travisscott #astroworld #tragedy #livenation{% endraw %}
