We can’t forget the excitement of our faculty, who came together to get a high boost and positive vibes before starting a hectic academic year.<br /><br />We organized a retreat that included team building, networking and socializing, group work, debates, and presentations to integrate new teachers with existing ADA faculty.<br /><br />We didn’t forget to recognize our faculty’s hard work and awarded them ‘Best Müəllim’ and ‘Outstanding Müəllim and Alim’.{% endraw %}
