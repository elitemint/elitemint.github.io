It may seem like no big deal to most people however finally having steps to a front door is a huge improvement for us! Finally we will no longer have our family of 5 going in and out through the back room of our house (aka our temporary bedroom). Once the steps are completed and all the boards are stained for the ceiling of the porch, we move on to torching and installing the angled accent beams and painting around the front door. Most importantly, we finally get the American Flag installed on the home we built. It's been a long time coming and something we haven't been able to fly since we left our previous home in the suburbs. <br /><br />Shop Our Apparel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bunkerbranding.com/pages/wild-wonderful-off-grid">https://www.bunkerbranding.com/pages/wild-wonderful-off-grid</a><br /><br />We are a couple who are building our own home from the ground up in the mountains of West Virginia.  After living near the city our entire lives we finally decided to sell it all, pack up our 3 kids and live in an RV on our 73 acres while building our own debt free, off-grid house and learning to live a more self-reliant life.<br />Our house build is documented entirely on our main channel &quot;Wild Wonderful Off-Grid&quot; and our family life vlogs can be found on our secondary channel &quot;Wild Wonderful After Show&quot;{% endraw %}
