Undying abilities force opponents to either kill him or suffer powerful debuffs in a teamfight. Decay is a spammable ability that steals enemies' Strength in an area, making them more fragile and Undying himself more durable as the fight goes on while also being exceptionally potent during the early laning phase, leaving your opponents with mere scraps of health. Soul Rip can act as both a powerful heal or nuke, redirecting the flow of living energy to a target.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Undying">https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Undying</a><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />💚Submit Your Replay: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/u792D7">https://goo.gl/u792D7</a><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />⏩Social Media:<br />🔸Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/dota2divine">https://www.youtube.com/c/dota2divine</a><br />🔹Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/DotaIIDivine">https://www.facebook.com/DotaIIDivine</a><br />►Google Plus: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DOTA2Divine">https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DOTA2Divine</a><br />►Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/dota2divine">https://twitter.com/dota2divine</a><br />►Reddit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dota2Divine/">https://www.reddit.com/user/Dota2Divine/</a><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />Dota 2 is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve Corporation.
