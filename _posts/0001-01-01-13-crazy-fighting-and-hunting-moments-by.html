They do, indeed. Foxes pose a significant threat even in urban areas, as they are both strong and merciless. Taking precautions to protect chickens from predators is critical no matter where you live. This fox tries to grab whatever chicken it can and with a little perseverance and a lot of speed, it catches up to one chicken and kills it. This fox jumps on a hen and kills it instantly, or so he thinks. The hen begins to run wild with feathers flying all over the place, but it never returns and neither does the fox. However, for someone creative, there are enough feathers on the floor to make a nice, fluffy pillow. This fox has a field day when he breaks into this chicken coop. He attacks every chicken in sight, kills a few, and creates havoc in the coop. <br /><br />The chickens are in a state of immense panic, and they just want the fox to leave. One of the chickens, calls 911 and hopefully, help is on the way. This fox is trying to get at these chickens, but they seem well protected inside the chicken coop. The fox looks for a weakness in the structure but can’t seem to find one. He keeps going back and forth between the coop and the other side of the pine tree. I’m not sure if the coop stretches behind the tree and maybe that’s why the fox is doing this. But the chickens like they’re all fine and the fox can’t find a way in. It took this fox twenty seconds to kill two chickens and injure one. The fox didn’t hesitate one second and knew exactly what he was doing. Some foxes are so determined, nothing will stop them from getting to their target.<br /><br />Fox VS Dog<br /><br />This fox harasses a chubby dog, and the dog doesn’t appreciate it. The dog barks at the fox, but the fox doesn’t back down and even tries to bite the dog’s legs. The fox is stubborn and even if the dog continues barking, the fox doesn’t care and stands his ground. This fox is not very big, but boy, does he have a lot of energy. I’m not sure if these two are playfighting or if they’re involved in a real fight, but the dog looks like he’s trying to bite the fox’s abdomen. It’s a tough fight, but not entirely convinced they hate each other. However, at some point, I almost feel like the dog will cut the fox’s stomach open. This dog finds a fox in his backyard and a big fight ensues with the fox struggling to escape. The fight doesn’t last long and the fox takes off as soon as it can.{% endraw %}
