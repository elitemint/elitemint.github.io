Thank you.<br />The Second Coming of Jesus Christ is one that Christians all over the world have been expecting earnestly. It was prophesied both in the old testament by the prophets (Zechariah 14:1-15) and in the new testament by Jesus Christ himself(John 14:1-3). The second coming of Jesus is one that must not meet us unprepared. It is important to know the signs that come before the second coming of Jesus Christ.<br />The signs that were spoken about have already begun manifestation. The world has dipped into an unexpected low, economies are crashing,morals keep dipping.<br />The book of Matthew 24 speaks about the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. It tells all about the signs that when you see indicate the second coming of Jesus Christ.<br />In verse 3 of Matthew 24, the disciples of Jesus Christ ask for the signs that they will see and know that Jesus is coming. <br />The first of the signs that Jesus gives  is  that many would come in his name to decieve &quot;Matthew  24:4 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.  24:5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many&quot;. Many false prophets have arisen in several parts of the world claiming to be the Christ. Some performed miracles and prophesied, they have taught different doctrines outside of the Bible and they continue to appear as angels of light meanwhile they represent darkness. Several false Christs have appeared and disappeared just as they had come. All over the world, we witness an influx of false prophets and doctrines that continue to lead the flock astray. Many christians have fallen victims of these false prophets. It is therefore important to know that the bible is the code of conduct for every christian and the holy spirit our regulator. Anything outside of the Bible should be weighed and tested. May we not fall on the wayside  in Jesus name.<br /> Another sign that would happen before the second coming of Jesus Christ is persecution of the followers of Jesus. Matthew  24:9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. This verse of the Bible is one that has become a reality in our world today. Christians all over the world are being persecuted for their faith. Many Christians have experienced persecution one way or the other because they acknowledge Christ as their Saviour. In their work places, homes, communities etc.The persecution varies from as much as murder to spreading of rumours, to hate all because they profess jesus as their Lord.  In some countries of the world Christians cannot boldly come out to profess their faith, they are in hiding because even the laws of the land seeks to prosecute them and not protect them.The numbers of christian martyrs all over the world is spiking on a daily basis.<br />In Matthew  24:6  the bible says &quot;And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.  24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places&quot; Hmm the bible here talks about wars, famines, earthquakes and pestilences. These signs are visible in almost every part of the world. <br />Earthquakes and natural disasters are no longer news stories because we hear about them frequently.  They appear more frequently than usual and even the countries of the world that have good emergency systems still record huge casualties. <br />In many countries of the world, there is internal conflicts, tussle for power, coups, unstable governments rebel gangs overthrowing the government, there are threats of civil wars and world wars. All of these are enough to imprint fear in the hearts of people but 1 John  5:14 &amp;15 say that &quot;this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us: And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him&quot;. Our prayers can't stop Jesus from coming but it would give us peace and succour in the trying times.{% endraw %}
