The architects Françoise N’Thépé and Aldric Beckmann promptly opted for glass as their material of choice – more precisely, a rainscreen cladding<br />façade system from Sto. This allowed them to use StoVentec Glass elements to create a dazzling fresco on the facade. <br /><br />The different hues are a reflection of the surroundings:<br />The elements are mostly blue and white towards the sky, green towards the park, and crimson towards the city. With the single-source StoVentec system solution, it was easy to implement the colour requirements for the design and create combinations with other materials, such as the rendered surfaces of the plinth storey.<br /><br />More information about the project at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sto.com">https://www.sto.com</a>{% endraw %}
