{% raw %}Our donors can securely use PayPal like they've always done - emails jimnduruchi@yahoo.com, jimnduruchi1@gmail.com, donate@killthejigger.org. You can also go to the website killthejigger.org and get information about how to donate through the bank, Remitly, MoneyGram and Patreon. We're good to go, guys! Let's keep painting the world with love (I know the color of love, And it lives inside of you).{% endraw %}
