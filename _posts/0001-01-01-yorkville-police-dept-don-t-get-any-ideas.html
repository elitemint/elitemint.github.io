{% raw %}Part 2 will be released on black Friday. <br /><br />On 11/24/21, I arrived at the Yorkville, IL police department and began conducting a first amendment audit.These audits are intended to promote transparency, accountability and educating both the public and public employees. All of the men you are viewing in this video are later suspects in attempted intimidation after I conducted a complaint compliance check in Part 2.{% endraw %}
