{% raw %}**SIMILAR CLASSIC CARS ALWAYS REQUIRED**<br />A wonderfully preserved cult classic Fiat Panda 1000CL with just 47,361 miles.<br />  <br />EQUIPMENT<br />PVC underbody protection, plastic wheel arch liners, twin door mirrors, rear fog/reversing lights, heated rear window, reclining front seats, tilt/tip front seats, front head restraints, folding rear seat, inertia reel front and rear seat belts, driver and passenger door bins, front utility shelf, rear parcel shelf, opening rear side windows, protective rubber boot matting.<br /><br />EXTERIOR<br />This super chic Fiat Panda is finished in original Fiat Grigio Oslo (code 626).  The paint finish has retained a marvellous uniform shine and bright polished finish.  The famously lightweight body panels are straight and free from dings or corrosion and being structurally excellent, this truly is a rare survivor.  Close inspection will reveal only very minimal and minor age related scratches to the paintwork which certainly take nothing away from the instantly recognisable Giorgio Giugiaro design classic that is simple, boxy and charming.   All original trim sections and badges are intact and even the supplying main dealer number plates remain fitted!  Now difficult to find in this original unmolested condition, this example is an enthusiast’s delight.  <br /><br />INTERIOR<br />The delightfully sparse interior of this Panda harks back to a far simpler era of motoring with an emphasis on everything you need and not a lot more!  Surprisingly comfortable, the Superior style seats and matching door trim is beautifully clean and wear free.  Many thoughtful design touches such as the movable ash tray and capacious door pockets remain intact.  The additional front utility shelf trimmed in matching seat material offers further storage space and the original carpeting is spotless.  All functions and controls operate perfectly and remain true to the manufacturers intentions.  Uber stylish!<br /><br />ENGINE &amp; TRANSMISSION<br />Fitted with the 999cc fully integrated and robotised engine, this car is surprisingly lively producing 45bhp at 5000rpm and maximum torque of 59lbs.ft at 2750rpm.  Quiet and remarkably economical (46.3mpg) due to simple single point fuel injection it will provide the new owner with very low running costs but maximum reliability and tremendous fun.  The four speed gearbox is light, smooth and precise.  A guaranteed smile on your face once behind the wheel. <br /><br />WHEELS, TYRES &amp; BRAKES<br />Five immaculate factory standard steel wheels are shod in 135/80 R13 tyres with good tread remaining.  The spare wheel is correctly housed in the engine compartment which is incredibly clean with factory stickers displayed.  Independent brake circuits incorporating front discs and rear drums bring the car to a straight line stop quickly and safely.<br /><br />HISTORY FILE<br />Registered new by Fiat Main Dealer Station Garage in Ipswich on 27th August 1987, this example has led a truly cherished and pampered existence.  The original service booklet has many main dealer and specialist stamps to fully document the incredibly low 47,361 miles and serves to illustrate the fastidious servicing and maintenance this car has enjoyed. The previous keeper being a renowned Fiat specialist who saved the vehicle from being crushed after a tip off and repaired a small knock to the nearside front wing.  Subsequently the car has had a Vehicle Identity Check by VOSA just two months after being damaged repairable.  Kept by him for a further two years and enjoyed at classic car events, the vehicle is now ready for its new owner.  A full set of keys are present and operate all locks.  The brown Fiat PVC A5 document holder contains the Fiat Panda Owners Handbook, Fiat Aftercare book, Fiat Auto (U.K) Ltd Warranty Document and other point of sale literature.<br /><br />A seldom seen example on today’s roads, this little Fiat represents a versatile, practical and tremendously economical car with bags of cheeky charm!{% endraw %}
