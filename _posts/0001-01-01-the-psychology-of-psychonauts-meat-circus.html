{% raw %}Good day everyone! Today we continue our Psychology of Psychonauts Series and move into the next world in the game. Every World in Psychonauts is based upon the Psyche of a Character in the story. As such the design and symbolism directly relate to what issues they are dealing with. <br /><br />In this series, we will analyze each of these worlds and try to learn what we can about these people. For this video, the climax of the story starts when Coach Oleander's plan is revealed. After the destruction of his death tank, Raz's and Morceau's brain merge together in a brain tank. Their mental worlds bleed together to form the Meat Circus. The mixture of The Traveling Circus Razputin grew up in and the Butcher shop that Oleander's father owned. With their minds linked together, if Raz cannot solve the coach's issues, his mind may be lost for good. Let's take a look and see what it is that has been troubling Little Olly. <br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/GamingUniversity06/">https://www.facebook.com/GamingUniversity06/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/GamingUniversi6">https://twitter.com/GamingUniversi6</a><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/jkUdZFp">https://discord.gg/jkUdZFp</a><br /><br />#psychonauts #meatcircus #GamingUniversity{% endraw %}
