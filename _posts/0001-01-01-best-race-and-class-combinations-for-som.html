{% raw %}In today’s video we’re going to be going over the best race and class combinations in vanilla WoW based on each race due to their racials. And what class maximized their race’s potential as much as possible. Starting off with the Alliance, and working our way down. Keep in mind, Druid is not in this video as only one race can be them on both Horde and Alliance, and this video is both made of PvE and PvP comparisons and will be discussing both as much as possible.   <br /> <br />Video Managed by FelPlague<br />Video edited by  Splitrift<br /><br />--The Video--<br />Intro: (0:00)<br />Alliance-Hunter: (0:22)<br />Alliance-Mage: (2:04)<br />Alliance-Paladin: (3:29)<br />Alliance-Priest: (4:54)<br />Alliance-Rogue: (7:10)<br />Alliance-Warlock: (8:40)<br />Alliance-Warrior: (10:10)<br />Horde-Hunter: (11:18)<br />Horde-Mage: (13:33)<br />Horde-Priest: (15:03)<br />Horde-Rogue: (17:18)<br />Horde-Shaman: (19:06)<br />Horde-Warlock: (19:40)<br />Horde-Warrior: (22:52)<br /><br />--Social Media--<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/hirumared">https://twitter.com/hirumared</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Hirumaredx">https://www.facebook.com/Hirumaredx</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/hirumaredx">http://www.patreon.com/hirumaredx</a><br /><br />Become a member for custom emotes and name tag in comments -<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCap5sQEW2w7aoM2ehCdNVNQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCap5sQEW2w7aoM2ehCdNVNQ/join</a><br /><br />- #WoW #WorldofWarcraft #warcraft<br /><br />Browse my gaming, editing, and office gear along with some pretty cool book recommendations, and more, here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/hirumaredx">https://www.amazon.com/shop/hirumaredx</a>{% endraw %}
