Brushing the pan with oil is optional, Thatâ€™s me just being extra careful do that the mixture does not stick to the pan and also it keeps the parchment paper in place.<br /><br />Now roughly chop the nuts and set it aside for later.  Now add water to a pot about 1 to 2 inches and bring it to a boil for the double boiler. <br /><br />To a HEAT PROOF BOWL add the chocolate chips, almond butter, milk, vanilla extract and salt. Place the heat proof bowl on top of of the boiling water pot and let it sit for about 5 minutes to allow the chocolate to melt before stirring it. After 5 minutes or so you will notice that the chocolate would have started to melt, at this point stir it gently with  spatula or a whisk. Stir it gently to prevent air bubbles. It will take about 10 to 12 minutes for the ingredients to complete melt. Once the mixture is melted thoroughly and looks smooth and silky pour it to the prepared pan. Make sure to pour it right away otherwise it will start to set and if that happens put it back on the double boiler to melt it again.<br /><br />Sprinkle the chopped Almonds &amp; Pistachios on top and slightly press it into the chocolate with a spatula (with a very light touch). You can add any topping of your liking or even skip the topping if you want it plain.<br /><br />Allow it to cool down to room temperature and then refrigerate for 4 to 5 hours for the flavours to blend (longer the better). Once chilled, cut them into cubes and store in an airtight container. It stores well in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 weeks.<br /><br /><br />IMPORTANT TIPS:<br /><br />- Use a heat proof bowl to melt the chocolate<br /><br />- Once the chocolate mix has melted, make sure to pour it right away otherwise it will start to set and if that happens put it back on the double boiler to melt it again<br /><br />- You can add any topping of your liking or even skip the topping if you want it plain<br /><br />- If you would like it more sweeter then add a tablespoon of maple syrup to the mix<br /><br />-To get a cleaner cut of the chocolate squares, wipe the knife with paper towel after each cut<br /><br />Enjoy!<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.{% endraw %}
