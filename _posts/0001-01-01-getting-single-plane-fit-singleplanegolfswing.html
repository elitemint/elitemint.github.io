Club Fitting is critical to make the most of your Single Plane Swing. In this video, I hit golf balls on the range as I take you inside my new golf bag from wedge to driver, discussing my personal specs for each club. I'll also answer a commonly asked question: should you use single length golf clubs?<br /><br />My golf club review discusses:<br />—Callaway Epic Speed Driver 2021<br />—Callaway Epic Fairway Woods 2021<br />—Callaway Epic SuperHybrid 2021<br />—Callaway Rogue Irons<br />—Callaway Jaws Wedges &amp; Jaws Full Toe Raw Face Wedges 2021<br />----------<br />The Single Plane golf swing is not a quick fix golf technique. It is a system, beginning at address, that simplifies the most important moment of the golf swing—impact.  <br /><br />Starting at address on two planes where the arms hang straight down at address, the Conventional golf swing is complicated.  Because the arms are hanging straight down, a conventional golfer must lift the body into impact creating stress on the back.  <br /><br />This upward movement to accommodate the two planes is unnecessary. The Single Plane Golf swing simplifies the golf swing by eliminating the need for the upward movement by starting and impacting on the same plane.<br />Graves Golf Training Aids: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.gravesgolf.com">https://shop.gravesgolf.com</a><br />Alignment and Ball Position Trainer (ABT) - Right Handed:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2Mu0GwL">http://bit.ly/2Mu0GwL</a><br />Alignment and Ball Position Trainer (ABT) - Left Handed:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2tX7vk0">http://bit.ly/2tX7vk0</a><br /><br />To learn more about the Single Plane Golf Swing, you can order my best selling book here:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Single-Plane-Golf-Swing-Better/dp/1612541925/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2Q69Q1VDGBEFD&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+single+plane+golf+swing+book&amp;qid=1633184673&amp;sprefix=the+single+plane+golf+swing%2Caps%2C200&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFaUk8zTVBJRUdXRlQmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA2OTcwNjcyNjFGVFU5VEI3RlhLJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAyOTg2ODczU09BSkRMMzFBWE9DJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==">https://www.amazon.com/Single-Plane-Golf-Swing-Better/dp/1612541925/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2Q69Q1VDGBEFD&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+single+plane+golf+swing+book&amp;qid=1633184673&amp;sprefix=the+single+plane+golf+swing%2Caps%2C200&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFaUk8zTVBJRUdXRlQmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA2OTcwNjcyNjFGVFU5VEI3RlhLJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAyOTg2ODczU09BSkRMMzFBWE9DJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==</a><br /><br />Transcript on Single Length Clubs:<br />&quot;i think maybe the most common question i get about single playing club is should i use single length irons or single length clubs let's let's talk about one thing first you will never have every club in your bag one length you could but you're going to have a real problem when you get to the hybrids and the woods and the longer clubs that you need to hit because those are going to be longer you need a longer lever and hit the ball longer distances there's always going to be matter of fact if you just saw the pga go into maximizing the driver length why did they do that because they want to try to taper back people going to longer longer clubs to hit it farther so now that's an indication that longer clubs do hit the ball longer distances because you can produce more speed especially if you're trained athletes like the guys on the tour so the real question is should you have single length irons because you're not going to have single length clubs you're going to have a a period you're going to have a portion of your set which your irons which are going to be all one length if you go that direction i choose not to and let me explain i just gotta speak from some experience here too as well but i want the ability to take this wedge this is a 52 degree wedge and hit shorter shots with it for control full shots with it if i want to but the problem with this is the faster you make a wedge go the more the ball spins the more the ball spins the more it lifts so as you get into these highly lofted clubs and you add length to them and you add the speed to them you get more spin and upward motion of the ball so now you got a problem because the club's so long it's hard to control the spin on it because of the speed that's why i don't like really long short irons okay so that's i want to put that out there before i get into this now i'm gonna here's my wedge i i the thing that people benefit from single length clubs is they say well i can i can be in one address position one spine tilt which is true you can be in a a similar spine position with a number of irons in your bag <br />i measured all this you know me i measure everything and with a wedge my spine is tilted to a 40 degree angle with a six iron it's a 45 degree angle with a three iron it's just a little bit more than let's say around 43. or i'm sorry 40 it goes it goes 40 45 and then 30 it's probably 39 it's not it's not even 39 is my driver so what i'm getting at is 39 with a driver 45 with a 6 iron 40 with a wedge okay so you have this 10 degree basically difference between wedge and driver and a six irons right in the middle of that now so you're telling me that those few degrees of angle are giving you a benefit&quot;{% endraw %}
