{% raw %}Today's video is a little different.  It is part project, part review.  The project part was only a partial success, but I thought that people still might be able to learn from it, so I've decided to release it.<br /><br />I purchased this Fender Players Series HSH stratocaster.  I liked it A LOT more than I expected, but found that there was a drastic volume different between positions 1 and 5 compared to 2-4. In order to remedy this I bought a Seymour Duncan Hot Rails pickup (effectively turning it into an HHH guitar).  <br />It only sort of worked, the volume balance is better, but it just doesn't blend as well as the original configuration.  I'm curious to hear your thoughts.<br /><br />There are a few variables that I encountered in this project.<br />- I ordered a Seymour Duncan SH1N and got an SH1B.  <br />- The five-way switch in the guitar was something I'd never seen before.  I connected the new pickup to the same place as the old one, but there may have been more than one option.  <br />- I might be able to get a different tone by using different conductors from the Duncan (I used the black as the hot and soldered/taped the red/white). <br /><br />Anyway, here is the video.  I hope you enjoy it!<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks for watching, and please like and subscribe, so I can continue to make videos.  If there is a video that you'd like to see then leave a comment, and I'll do my best to make it happen!<br /><br /><br />0:00 - Intro <br />1:25 - Introduction &amp; Overview for the Fender Players Series HSH<br />3:51 - Stock pickups clean tones and stock features overview<br />5:50 - Stock pickups with Marshall gain channel <br />7:53 - Clean tones Seymour Duncan SH1 installed<br />9:55 - Marshall gain with Seymour Duncan SH1 installed<br />10:40 - A/B comparison between Fender humbucker and SH1<br />12:21 - Final thoughts - where this falls in the current Fender lineup{% endraw %}
