These are guidelines and will change later, as we notice and observe more.<br /><br />Then draw parts of lines and parts of shapes with a darker line, then draw the tones you see by shading away from the lines, noticing where the tones are and drawing what you see.<br /><br />The last step is to draw a very dark shadow and blend or soften any lines or areas you need to work back into.<br /><br />Thank you for watching this art tutorial from my channel, Circle Line Art School, please subscribe to my channel for a new art tutorial each week, there are now more than 250 of my drawings to watch! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/circlelineartschool">http://www.youtube.com/circlelineartschool</a><br /><br />Circle Line Art School<br /><br />Hi, my name is Tom McPherson and I founded Circle Line Art School as an online art education resource for all.
