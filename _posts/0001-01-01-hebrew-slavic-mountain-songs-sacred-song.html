When the world called her out of her hometown, at 17 she moved to Cadaques, Spain where she became part of a local Jazz band, starting her path as a lead singer. In the years after, following her love for culture and the world, she explored various native traditions and there learned about the sacred art of using song and sound as a tool to heal and elevate. With her guitar she weaves the lessons and inspiration she found into enchanting, lyrical songs that tell of the beauty and depth of life. Now learning from her teacher Maestro Manuel Rufino as part of the Golden Drum Community she continues deepening her studies and understanding of the sacred cultures and the importance of song as prayer.{% endraw %}
