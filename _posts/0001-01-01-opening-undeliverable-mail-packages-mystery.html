{% raw %}In this video we open an entire pallet of undeliverable MYSTERY packages! You won't believe what we found! A lot of times undeliverable mail cannot be returned to the sender for a variety of reasons. Often the item is too large or came from too far(China) to be returned. We plan on flipping these items for a profit.<br /><br />Sarah has been following the Facebook group of a pallet liquidator in our area who buys truckloads of Walmart, Target, and Amazon returns and then sells them by the pallet to resellers. Since we love flipping furniture we thought it would be a unique opportunity for us. He recently posted on his Facebook about a &quot;top-secret&quot; amazing load of undeliverable packages. We couldn't pass it up!<br /><br />BIG NEWS! Our &quot;Flipping Guide - How To Flip Almost Anything&quot; eBook is available NOW!

Opening them is half the fun, which is why we make these unboxing videos! Reselling Amazon returns can be a great side hustle if you know how to list, sell, and ship items on eBay and Facebook. We have learned a lot through experience and hope you find these videos helpful and informative! Return pallet flipping is something weâ€™ve done before, but we wanted to try again to give it a fair chance. Not only is the pallet unboxing fun, but there is a great potential to make a lot of extra money!<br /><br />Our Video Gear: <br />Our Camera: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3tpY0E4">https://amzn.to/3tpY0E4</a><br />Our Main Lens: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3mskSia">https://amzn.to/3mskSia</a><br />Our Main Light: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3e2r11B">https://amzn.to/3e2r11B</a><br />Our Vlog Tripod: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3mtees0">https://amzn.to/3mtees0</a><br /><br />*We earn commissions for purchases made through links in this post.<br /><br />#palletflipping #sidehustle #flipping{% endraw %}
