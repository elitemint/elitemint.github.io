With the looks of a 90s R&amp;B superstar and a delivery that owes more to King Krule than to D'Angelo, KVN doesn't fit into the usual boxes.<br /><br />Raised in Romford, London with family ties in Lagos, he has built a loyal following with a couple of self-released songs and already enjoyed support from tastemakers like Jamz Supernova (BBC) and Jyoty (Rinse FM). After participating in The Silhouettes Project (check his single “What U Need“) KVN signed with Melting Pot Music, where he is releasing his new single “Gently“.<br /><br />On “Gently” melancholic Wurlitzer notes reverberate across a cold sonic landscape, beautifully accompanied by KVN’s tender tones, channeling a wintery tale about reconciliation. KVN explains: “Gently as a song represents the build-up in an argument with your other half. That moment at the end of an argument when you give in to your care for the other person. You take a breath, put aside your ego. The turmoil in the verses compared to the make up in the chorus represent the balance in compromise.“<br /><br />“I like to call my music ‘Noir R&amp;B’ when I get into my bag on the real slow melancholic vibes“ KVN adds. To fully catch the vibe, we recommend to check out the music video – produced &amp; directed by Alleycat Films – for the song. The stripped-back, raw quality of KVN's vocals and the reflective nature of his lyricism makes for a warming and addictive sound. With romance and relationships at the heart of his lyrical content, he uses passion, depth &amp; imagery to explore the ups and downs of love and the vulnerability of manhood.<br /><br />Follow KeepVibesNear<br />Spotify <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sptfy.com/keepvibesnear">https://sptfy.com/keepvibesnear</a><br />Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/keepvibesnear">https://www.instagram.com/keepvibesnear</a><br /><br />Follow Melting Pot Music<br />Spotify <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sptfy.com/meltingpotmusic">https://sptfy.com/meltingpotmusic</a><br />Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/melting_pot_music">https://www.instagram.com/melting_pot_music</a><br />YouTube <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MPMTV">https://www.youtube.com/user/MPMTV</a><br />Bandcamp <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://meltingpotmusic.bandcamp.com">https://meltingpotmusic.bandcamp.com</a><br />SoundCloud <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/mpmcgn">https://soundcloud.com/mpmcgn</a><br /><br />Credits:<br />Director: Sam Ripman (@samripman)<br />DOP: Stephen James Dunn (@stephen_dunn)<br />Producer: Alex Donaldson (@aldonaldson91)<br />Production company: Alleycat Films (@alleycatfilms)<br />Grade: Toby Tomkins @ Cheat (@tobytomkins @cheat_it)<br /><br />Cast:<br />KeepVibesNear (@keepvibesnear)<br />Cozy MJ (@cozy.mj) <br />Smil3y (@smil3ydj)<br />Harvey Whyte (@harveywhyte)<br /><br />Vocals by KeepVibesNear.<br />Vocals by Evie Golding.<br />Produced &amp; mixed by Louis Aura.<br />Co-Produced by ElMari &amp; Ross Murray.<br />Mastered by Outrageous Claims. <br /><br />Cat No: MPM 304<br />Artist: KeepVibesNear<br />Titel: Gently (feat.
