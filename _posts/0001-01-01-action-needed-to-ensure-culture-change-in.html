{% raw %}Action is needed to ensure there is a culture change within Police Scotland, the Scottish Liberal Democrats' deputy leader has indicated.<br /><br />Wendy Chamberlain, the MP for North East Fife, served as a police officer for 12 years between 1999 and 2011.<br /><br />She said that she recognises some of the reports highlighted in the force, after a report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland (HMICS) in October stated that Police Scotland still faces a 'considerable cultural challenge' over the experience of women and those from minority-ethnic backgrounds.{% endraw %}
