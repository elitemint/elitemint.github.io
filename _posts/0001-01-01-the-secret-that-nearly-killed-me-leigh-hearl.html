Hiding it nearly destroyed her. Consumed by shame, self-doubt and despair, it was only when she broke her silence that her broken heart began to heal. She realised how many people lock their painful secrets deep down inside, soldiering on in silence and never able to move on from traumatic experiences. The simple act of sharing her story set her free, so she decided to help others, founding Meg Heart. <br />The team create a safe space for people to break their silence and share their secrets so they can heal. Leigh also believes real stories change the world, starting the conversations we must have.
