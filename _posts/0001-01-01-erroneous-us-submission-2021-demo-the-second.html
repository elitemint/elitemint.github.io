{% raw %}The second demo of this solo act from Oregon.<br /><br />Here has in the debut, he presents a blend of an extremely melancholic mix of black and doom, and another Edward Munch’s cover (Love and Pain)<br />Instead of extremely slow pace and bassy melodies typical from Doom textures, you have just the gloom musically and lyrically, and the typical guitar solos from that genre but also the vocals and some speck of black metal’s fury.<br />The songwriting is completely breathtaking, filled with harmonies and ornaments, and between the guitar cries and the dismal vocals or even the beautiful lyrics, you have plenty to embrace and to let yourself go in MB’s heartfelt songs.<br /><br /><br /><br />Band: Erroneous <br />Album: Submission <br />Year: 2021<br />Label: Independent<br />Genre: Black / Doom Metal <br />Country: United States<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://erroneous.bandcamp.com/album/submission">https://erroneous.bandcamp.com/album/submission</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/erroneousdoom/">https://www.facebook.com/erroneousdoom/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/erroneousdoom/">https://www.instagram.com/erroneousdoom/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/erroneousdoom">https://soundcloud.com/erroneousdoom</a><br /><br />Tracklist: <br />1.
