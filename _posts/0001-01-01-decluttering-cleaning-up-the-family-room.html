{% raw %}Thanks for stopping by! In today‚Äôs video I‚Äôm going to finish decluttering my family room. I have 2 big built in bookshelves to tackle, declutter &amp; organize. I also have 2 end tables that I didn‚Äôt declutter in my first family room video. <br />You can find that video here and I decluttered all my cupboards that were completely filled with stuff! I also decluttered my coffee table that has a large amount of storage and was filled with more stuff ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/jAkgTQPcS3M">https://youtu.be/jAkgTQPcS3M</a><br /><br />I‚Äôm hosting thanksgiving at my house this year so I need to get the family all finished, decluttered and cleaned for Thursday<br /><br />Deckuttering the hidden spaces in my house has been so relaxing and rewarding. Even though I couldn‚Äôt see the clutter I knew it was there and it bothered me! <br /><br />So happy with how tidy the family room looks now ‚ù§Ô∏è<br /><br />If you‚Äôd like to checkout my couponing channel you can find it here <br />@Jodi M Dunn <br /><br />Want to contact me? <br />Email - jodimdunn@gmail.com<br />Instagram @ jodimdunn<br />P.O.
