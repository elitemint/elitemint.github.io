{% raw %}in person college?!!?!? what a concept! so happy to be back on campus - it feels so surreal, nerve-wracking but exciting! i kind of just filmed a bunch of stuff the week leading up to move in day, and compiled it into a vlog featuring a mild breakdown in reaction to my new hair, as well as some random bits and bobs of my days. if this upload seems late for the &quot;college youtube timeline,&quot; i started school on september 29 (yes, i know...just quarter system things), so i have been at school for only 2 weeks! anyways, whether you've started school recently, or have been in school for a while now...i hope you're doing alright, taking care of yourself, and doing your best! i'm proud of y'all :') <br /><br />until next time,<br />deborah ♡<br /><br />CHAPTERS:<br />0:00 - intro <br />0:29 - chapter 1: getting out of a slump<br />2:18 - chapter 2: a trip to ikea<br />2:57 - chapter 3: dyeing my hair pink!<br />6:05 - chapter 4: packing &amp; preparing for moving<br />9:40 - chapter 5: move in day!<br /> <br />CAPTION TRANSLATIONS <br />➢ you can contribute caption translations for this video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3DlHdGq">https://bit.ly/3DlHdGq</a><br /><br />☾ outfit deets* ☽<br />black corset top ↠ urban outfitters (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.magik.ly/ml/1azbr/)">https://go.magik.ly/ml/1azbr/)</a><br />white tank top ↠ h&amp;m (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.magik.ly/ml/1azbw/)">https://go.magik.ly/ml/1azbw/)</a><br />navy sweater ↠ yesstyle (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3mCZyIf)">https://bit.ly/3mCZyIf)</a> <br />pink beanie ↠ old zara (similar: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.magik.ly/ml/1azby/)">https://go.magik.ly/ml/1azby/)</a><br />green heart sweater ↠ old mixxmix <br /><br />☾ dorm stuff ☽<br />whiteboard ↠ (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.magik.ly/ml/1azcd/)">https://go.magik.ly/ml/1azcd/)</a><br />wooden lamp (clock) ↠ (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.magik.ly/ml/1azcf/)">https://go.magik.ly/ml/1azcf/)</a> <br />led lights ↠ (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.magik.ly/ml/1azcc/)">https://go.magik.ly/ml/1azcc/)</a> <br />steamer ↠ (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.magik.ly/ml/1azcb/)">https://go.magik.ly/ml/1azcb/)</a><br />tripod ↠ (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.magik.ly/ml/1azca/)">https://go.magik.ly/ml/1azca/)</a><br />black wire shelf ↠ (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.magik.ly/ml/1azc6/)">https://go.magik.ly/ml/1azc6/)</a><br />wooden shelf ↠ (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.magik.ly/ml/1azc7/)">https://go.magik.ly/ml/1azc7/)</a> <br /><br />★ socials ★<br />instagram ↠ @dobochobo (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dobochobo/)">https://www.instagram.com/dobochobo/)</a><br />tiktok ↠ @dobochobo <br />spotify ↠ @peachorbit <br />pinterest ↠ @dobochobo<br /><br />➢ current sub count: 220K :') so grateful for you all mwah<br /><br />♫ music ♫<br />epidemic sound<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://louiezong.bandcamp.com/​​​​​​">https://louiezong.bandcamp.com/​​​​​​</a><br /><br />❀ faq ❀<br />what's your name? deborah :-) (she/her pronouns)<br />how old are you? 19 (born in 2002)<br />what do you use to film? canon g7x mark ii + iphone 11<br />what do you use to edit? final cut pro x &amp; autodesk sketchbook (for graphics)<br />what does dobochobo mean? long story short, it's a nickname that i made up for myself LOL<br /><br />business inquiries only: dobochobo@gmail.com<br /><br />this video is not sponsored. <br />*some links are affiliate links, which means i get a tiny commission if you purchase using those links at no extra cost to you! thank you for helping support me so i can keep making videos~{% endraw %}
