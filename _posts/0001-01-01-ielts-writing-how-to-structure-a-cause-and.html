{% raw %}You can always send us your writings to be checked along with comprehensive feedback, the same as you see in this video. <br />In this video recorded by Ross IELTS Academy, we're going to check out a Task2 essay written by one of our candidates, and see why he got 7.5. <br /><br />Before doing that, remember 4 important things when you practicing the IELTS writing: <br />1. Fully address all parts of the task, and present a fully developed position in answer to the question. <br />2. Support your ideas in a logical way. Don’t forget about paragraphing appropriately. <br />3. Try to use a wide range of vocabulary and not repeating some words over and over. <br />4. Most of your sentences should be error-free grammatically. <br />To get 7 and above you must avoid using simple structures. <br />Don’t worry, I will explain all these things in detail, later in other videos. Now let’s get started to check this writing together. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rossielts.com/writing-general-and-academic/">https://rossielts.com/writing-general-and-academic/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rossielts.com/3-writing-correction-written-and-video-feedback/">https://rossielts.com/3-writing-correction-written-and-video-feedback/</a><br /><br />&quot;Good luck&quot;{% endraw %}
