{% raw %}The story of Xigera Safari Lodge is one of renewal, rebirth, family legacy and of the pioneering spirit that drives us to seek out Africa’s wild spaces. The same spirit that inspired this remarkable reimagining, perhaps a complete reinvention of an Okavango Delta safari.<br /><br />This is Xigera (pronounced ‘kee-jera’), named for the Pied Kingfisher that makes its home amid the watery channels of Botswana’s Moremi Game Reserve.<br /><br />Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.2by2holidays.co.uk">https://www.2by2holidays.co.uk</a> to speak to us about planning your next safari.{% endraw %}
