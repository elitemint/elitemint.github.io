{% raw %}Small cats are just as skilled and efficient as big cats when they hunt, and believe it or not, certain species, like the black-footed cat, are the cat family’s best hunters. Have you ever seen a caracal jump in the air to catch a bird? What about an ocelot hunting a coati? If you want to see small cats doing their thing, stick around, as we look at Cats, the small killers! <br /><br />► Subscribe For New Videos! ► shorturl.at/krBX9 <br /><br />Watch our “Top 15 Wild Dog Attacks”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/uXSJVYCrg6g">https://youtu.be/uXSJVYCrg6g</a><br />Watch our “15 Epic And Deadliest Hunts By Wild Animals”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/O4xClHAbp2A">https://youtu.be/O4xClHAbp2A</a><br />Watch our “15 Curious Cheetah Cubs Trying To Hunt”<br />video here:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/qHRClm2h4t8">https://youtu.be/qHRClm2h4t8</a><br /><br />Cat VS Fish <br /><br />Cats are carnivorous animals with a high protein requirement. Fish is a high-quality source of protein and fat that most cats enjoy eating. Cats enjoy fish because of its nutritional value, which they detect with their taste buds. The cat in this video has the pick of the litter when he approaches a small pond full of goldfish. He carefully plans the attack and just when the time is right, he snatches the biggest one out of the water and runs home to enjoy his meal. Check out how quick and skilled this cat is when he goes fishing. He quietly approaches the water and identifies his target, after which he grabs the fish with his paw, and it is game over. This cat isn’t satisfied with just grabbing a small fish. He goes into the water and hits the jackpot when he grabs a fish that’s almost as big as he is. Now, that’s what I call overachieving. <br /><br />Cat VS Rat<br /><br />This neighborhood cat dispatches a large rat. This rat is not a pet, but rather one of those nasty pests that get into houses, gnaw through walls to get into your food supply and spread diseases like leptospirosis, which can kill the person infected. Even if the cat kills the rat, the risk of the cat catching something is high, so while getting rid of the pest is a good thing, the cat may suffer the consequences of the attack, later on. Here is a black and white cat that snatches a rat and carries it in its mouth, to drop it after a few seconds. Maybe the rat didn’t taste as good as the cat thought it would? I think it’s more likely because the cat wants to keep playing with his new friend before killing it. <br /><br />The cat grabs the rat again and keeps playing with it. This rat is not having a great day at the office as the cat juggles the rat-like a bad juggler. This rat is trying to free itself from the grip of this cat, but the feline carries the rat-like it in its lunchbox and heads outside into the sunlight with the rodent. This cat has got a grip on a fairly large rat and the cat is not very big, so I’m quite surprised the rat is not putting up a better fight. I know it’s kind of hard when the cat has it in a headlock like that, but how did it get stuck into that position in the first place? The cat is not letting go and it’s using the same technique as its bigger cousins, choking the rat to death.{% endraw %}
