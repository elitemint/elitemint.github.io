{% raw %}I finally converted this VHS tape to my computer! This was a commercial for the Fairly OddParents Big Wish Sweepstakes where you could win a Chevy Uplander and a trip to the Nickelodeon Family Suites. Unfortunately, I never participated, but I probably wouldn't have won either way. Drop a like for more.{% endraw %}
