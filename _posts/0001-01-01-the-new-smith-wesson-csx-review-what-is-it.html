{% raw %}In this episode of TFBTV, James Reeves reviews (and mini-torture tests) the (super-leaked) NEW Smith &amp; Wesson CSX, or &quot;Chief's Special X&quot;. Is this just a metal S&amp;W Shield Plus? No - it's also hammer fired. And single action only. And smaller. And lighter. And holds more ammo. You know what, just watched the damned video. <br /><br />««« GEAR USED IN THIS VIDEO »»»<br />‣ Apparel: All TFBTV apparel is sponsored by 5.11 Tactical and you can get it at www.511tactical.com<br />‣  Belly Band Holster - James prefers the APG Defender - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://activeprogear.com/product/defender-concealment-holster/">https://activeprogear.com/product/defender-concealment-holster/</a><br />‣  Eye Pro, Non-Tactical - James wears Electric Knoxville sunglasses ☞ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2YOVr3J">https://amzn.to/2YOVr3J</a><br />‣  Eye Pro, Tactical - James also wears Oakley M-Frames ☞ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3hEFrI9">https://amzn.to/3hEFrI9</a><br />‣  Ear Pro, Over Ear - Walker Razors ☞ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3nl29ss">https://amzn.to/3nl29ss</a> <br />‣  Ear Pro, In Ear - Surefire Sonic Defenders ☞ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ZI5xns">https://amzn.to/2ZI5xns</a><br />‣  Watch - James and Ryan wear the Garmin Fenix 6 ☞ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3lexr1B">https://amzn.to/3lexr1B</a><br /><br />««« GUN AND GEAR GIVEAWAYS »»»<br />Check out our Patreon and SubscribeStar pages if you enjoy our program, and consider helping us at TFBTV out.
