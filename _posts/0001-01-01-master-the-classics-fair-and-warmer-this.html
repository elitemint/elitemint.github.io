{% raw %}This drink was first published by Harry Craddock in his Savoy cocktail book in 1930. It's a fun little Rum Manhattan variation that I love and I thought you guys might love it too!<br /><br />Although I don't have much on this cocktail as far as history goes, I thought it might bear mentioning that Craddock's himself is an interesting character and has written one of the most influential cocktail books of all time. He was a British Born bartender who plied his trade in the United States, when prohibition came around, he went back to London to continue in his chosen profession and became head of The American Bar at The Savoy. He also became a naturalized American citizen who moved back to his own country to work as an immigrant. If that ain't interesting I don't know what is.<br /><br />I hope you guys like this little selection from Mr. Craddock and if you haven't picked up the Savoy Cocktail book you should definitely do that.
