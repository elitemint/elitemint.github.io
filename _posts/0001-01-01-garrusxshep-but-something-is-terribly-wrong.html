{% raw %}I don't even know how glitches like this keep happening. Oddly enough, a very similar glitch occurred during Garrus's LM in ME2. Chaos seems to follow him wherever he goes. That's how you know him and Shepard were meant to be.<br />Seriously though, is there a way to stop crap like this from happening? Its really ruining the moment.{% endraw %}
