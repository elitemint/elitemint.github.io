{% raw %}Timo Somers plays all the guitar solos in the track 28 Days (Till the End of Time) on the new Star One album ‘Revel in Time’. Check out this video to see him play this truly brilliant solo and don’t miss his video message! For me Timo is one of the best players in the world right now, a tasteful combination of power, melody and virtuosity.{% endraw %}
