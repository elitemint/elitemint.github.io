If that were the case, the entire royal bloodline that traces its lineage to Edward has no legal right to the throne. In fact, according to our own constitutional rules, Britain's real monarch today is not Elizabeth II, but King Michael, a resident of Jerilderie, Australia.<br /><br />From Elizabeth II to Cleopatra, Real Royalty peels back the curtain to give a glimpse into the lives of some of the most influential families in the world, with new full length documentaries posted every week covering the monarchies of today and all throughout history.<br /><br />Subscribe to Real Royalty: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/3tofGQL">http://bit.ly/3tofGQL</a><br /><br />Content licensed from DRG to Little Dot Studios.<br />Any queries, please contact us at: owned-enquiries@littledotstudios.com{% endraw %}
