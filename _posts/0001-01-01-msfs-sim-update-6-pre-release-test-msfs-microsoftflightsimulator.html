{% raw %}#msfs #microsoftflightsimulator #vr<br />Today we are in Ushuaia, Argentina enjoying the sites and testing VR again!<br /><br />The intention of this video is to benchmark the type of performance I am getting in more remote regions of the world. I don’t want to make these tests all about numbers, so I will focus on the overall experience in VR. I have purposely chosen this location to show what my PC and this sim are capable of in terms of performance and graphics in VR. <br /><br />As we are all anticipating sim update 6, I thought it would be useful to make a few new videos which can be seen as pre-release demos. These can be useful to reference and compare against update 6 once it has been released. I will make some more videos in similar areas to try and illustrate how the sim is performing in VR. I hope this video helps you dial in your own system, and see you in the sky soon!<br />✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈✈<br />Simulación Extrema Ushuaia - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://secure.simmarket.com/simulacin-extrema-sawh-ushuaia-malvinas-argentinas-international-airport-patagonia-msfs.phtml">https://secure.simmarket.com/simulacin-extrema-sawh-ushuaia-malvinas-argentinas-international-airport-patagonia-msfs.phtml</a><br />✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈✈<br />Lots of tutorials, live streaming, group flights, chat and if you have any specific requests, please join my Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/pEd2rn9Evf">https://discord.gg/pEd2rn9Evf</a><br />My MSFS user ID: PIESKYTOURS<br />✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈✈ <br />★Partners With Orbx: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://orbx.group/about-orbx">https://orbx.group/about-orbx</a><br />★ WIDMOvr VR lenses: USE DISCOUNT code: PIE IN THE SKY TOURS for a 5% discount, and order it here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://widmovr.com">https://widmovr.com</a><br />★ Buttkicker Gamer 2: USE DISCOUNT code PIEINTHESKYTOURS for a 20% coupon for viewers (valid: 12/31/21): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thebuttkicker.com/buttkicker-gamer2">https://thebuttkicker.com/buttkicker-gamer2</a><br />✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈✈<br />My setup:<br />Intel® Core™ i9-10900K Processor<br />NVIDIA RTX 3080 <br />ROG STRIX Z490-F GAMING<br />64GB RAM (3200mhZ)<br />970 EVO Plus NVMe M.2 SSD 1TB<br />Logitech MK220 Wireless combo<br />Razer Nari Essential Wireless Gaming Headset<br />HP Reverb G2 <br />Oculus Quest 2<br />Shure SM7B<br />Rode PSA1<br />Focusrite Scarlett 6i6 Audio Interface<br />Adobe Premiere Pro<br />Adobe After Effects<br />Adobe Audition<br />Honeycomb Alpha Flight Controls Yoke<br />Logitech Flight Throttle Quadrant<br />Thrustmaster TFRP Rudder Pedals<br />PlaySeat Evolution Alcantara<br />Next Level Racing GT LITE Cockpit<br />✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈ ✈✈<br />🏆 SUPPORT MY CHANNEL 🏆<br />📸 Follow me on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/pieintheskytours">https://www.instagram.com/pieintheskytours</a>{% endraw %}
