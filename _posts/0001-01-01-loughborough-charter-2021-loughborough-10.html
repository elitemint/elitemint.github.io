{% raw %}We got to visit the 800th Loughborough Charter fair up in Loughborough.  one of the last fairs of the 2021 season before the Winter Wonderlands kick in and so glad we did , an amazing ride line up set out in a really great street fair , brilliant rides there from the stunning looking Exciter , King Frogs , Over The Falls , X-Treme , Atmosfear , Midnight Express,  6 Arm Extreme, Fighter , 2 brilliant waltzer and so much more that the list is massive.  Brilliant fair and we loved every minute of it. Once again another brilliant job by the Showmen, Show Women and gaff lads who have put on another brilliant Funfair .{% endraw %}
