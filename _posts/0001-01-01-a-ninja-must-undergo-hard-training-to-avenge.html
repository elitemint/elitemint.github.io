{% raw %}A ninja must undergo hard training to avenge the death of his wife who was kílled by the ninja clan<br /><br />Fight everyone and trust no one: it's the code of survival practiced by martial-arts master Casey Bowman after his life of domestic bliss is shattered by a savage act of violence. Vowing revenge, the fearless American stealthily tracks the killer from Osaka to Bangkok to Rangoon with the help of a wise and crafty sensei. His only clues: a series of victims whose necks bear the distinctive mark of strangulation by barbed wire. Fighting to avenge as well as to survive, Casey must sharpen his razor-like responses and take his battle skills to the next level, even using deep meditation to fake his own death. His target: the sinister drug lord Goro, who is flooding the streets with deadly meth cooked at his remote jungle factory. To prepare for his ultimate confrontation, Casey must finally become an invisible warrior worthy of the name Ninja. But just when his prey is cornered, an unexpected twist shows Casey that his battle is only beginning: he truly can trust no one.<br /><br />Movie: Ninja: Shadow of a Tear<br />Year of Release: 2013<br />Production companies: Millennium Films<br />Watch the full movie here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Ninja-Shadow-Tear-Scott-Adkins/dp/B07FLHZRFS">https://www.amazon.com/Ninja-Shadow-Tear-Scott-Adkins/dp/B07FLHZRFS</a><br /><br />Thank you for watching. <br /><br />sci fi movies, romance movie review, sci fi review, sci fi summary, storyflix, movie review, movie summary, movies under 10 minutes, science fiction movie, movie trailer, full movie, daniel, trailer, daniel cc, daniel cc movie review, Netflix, story recapped, movie recapped, story, recapped, story recapped channel, movie recap, story recap, movie recaps, horror movie review, true scary stories, horror stories, mr. nightmare, creepypasta, creepy stories, true horror stories, horror, scary, stories told, movie review, Daniel, daniel CC, science fiction, trailer, Daniel CC movie review, daniel cc movie channel, movie explain channel, movie recap and explain, daniel movie, movie review, movie trailer, story recapped, story recapped movie review, story recapped channel, movie explained, movie recap, story recap, movie recaps, ending explained, storyflix, movie storyline, suspense movies, netflix movies, daniel cc, movie review channel, daniel cc movie, daniel cc review, story recapped glass, recap king{% endraw %}
