{% raw %}I say &quot;TV stand&quot;, but my TV is mounted on the wall and I'm using this for my audio equipment only. In any case, it would make a very capable TV stand - the top is solid 1&quot; thick ash along with sides of the cabinet. I used three 8&quot; wide boards to make the top and sides and the grain is continuous across the mitered corner joints.<br />The centre section is made from two 6&quot; ash boards and a hunk of thick walnut. The shelves are actually arms that cantilever out from the middle and being open promotes better ventilation.<br />I say 5 boards in the title because the walnut was an optional upgrade. I could have used the offcut ends from the ash boards to make those parts by gluing two thicknesses together.<br />The top / sides is one piece and it lifts off of the centre section so that I can hook everything up.<br />The dimensions:  21&quot; high x 21&quot; deep x 43&quot; long.<br /><br />▶️ Project plans for sale: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ibuildit.ca/plans/">https://ibuildit.ca/plans/</a><br />▶️Support the work I do on Locals:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ibuildit.locals.com/">https://ibuildit.locals.com/</a><br />▶️ Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=865843&amp;ty=h">https://www.patreon.com/user?u=865843&amp;ty=h</a><br />▶️ Join my Makers Mob for detailed build tutorials:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.themakersmob.com/john-heisz-i-build-it/?via=ibuildit">https://go.themakersmob.com/john-heisz-i-build-it/?via=ibuildit</a><br /><br />My &quot;Scrap bin&quot; channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/IBuildItScrapBin">https://www.youtube.com/c/IBuildItScrapBin</a><br /><br />#ibuildit<br />#woodworking<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ibuildit.ca/">https://ibuildit.ca/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/I-Build-It-258048014240900/">https://www.facebook.com/I-Build-It-258048014240900/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/i_build_it.ca/">https://www.instagram.com/i_build_it.ca/</a>{% endraw %}
