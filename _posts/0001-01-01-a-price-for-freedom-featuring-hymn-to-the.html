{% raw %}&quot;I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same...&quot;<br /> <br />These sacred words are the foundation upon which service to our nation is built. This documentary video is a somber reminder that countless numbers of our brave countrymen have made the supreme sacrifice so that our nation will be preserved and its people will flourish. They are American heroes entombed in hallowed graves at home, abroad and beneath the seas - many whose final resting place is known only to God. <br /><br />“With special thanks to Douglas and Sharon Coppi, Stanley Moore, Herbert R.
