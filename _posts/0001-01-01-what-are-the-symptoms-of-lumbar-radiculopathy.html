{% raw %}What Are the Symptoms of Lumbar Radiculopathy? | Spinal Nerve Root Pain | Disc Bulge<br /><br />Click here to learn more about treatment of Lumbar Radiculopathy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://age2b.com/lumbar-radiculopathy-symptoms">https://age2b.com/lumbar-radiculopathy-symptoms</a><br /><br />Usually, the first and main symptom of lumbar radiculopathy is pain in the lower part of the spine. It occurs as a result of compression of the nerve roots caused by a disc herniation, bone spurs, or thickened ligaments. When lower back pain in lumbar radiculopathy is caused by an intervertebral disc herniation, it is made worse by bending forward while sitting for extended periods of time.<br /><br />Pain in the legs may be a symptom of lumbar radiculopathy. It occurs due to compression of nerves, which extend into the legs through the lumbar portion of the spine. Back pain in lumbar radiculopathy is usually intermittent; it comes and goes during the day and may be accompanied by tingling, burning, numbness, or muscle cramps.<br /><br />In most cases, pain in lumbar radiculopathy increases with movement. The reason this occurs is the compression of the nerve roots during the movement of the lumbar vertebrae. In some rare cases, people with lumbar radiculopathy have pain in one part of the leg, with numbness, tingling, or muscle weakness in another part.<br /><br />#radiculopathy #backpain #spine #lumbarradiculopathysymptoms{% endraw %}
