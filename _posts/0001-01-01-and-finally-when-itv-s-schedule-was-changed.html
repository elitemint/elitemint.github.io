{% raw %}When ITV's schedule was changed in early 1999, the main evening news was moved from 10pm - and the 'News at Ten' was therefore brought to an end. To mark the occasion ITN Factual made a documentary for Channel 4 (transmitted 7 March 1999) to tell the story of the News at Ten.<br /><br />Interviewees include current and former ITN figures: Andrew Gardner, Sandy Gall, Gerald Seymour, Sir Geoffrey Cox, Julia Somerville, Jon Snow, Sir David Nicholas, Trevor McDonald, Michael Nicholson, Anna Ford, Michael Brunson, Paul Carleton, Paul Davies, and Stewart Purvis.{% endraw %}
