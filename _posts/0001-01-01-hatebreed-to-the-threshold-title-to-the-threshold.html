{% raw %}TITLE: To The Threshold<br />ARTIST: Hatebreed<br />ALBUM: Supremacy<br />YEAR: 2006<br /><br />I DO NOT OWN ANYTHING!!!<br /><br />LYRICS:<br /><br />This is the sound of the lost, beaten and broken, rising up and claiming what has been taken from us<br />From the shadows of the past<br />From the depths of our own failures<br />Stepping forward into the light<br />Denying our demise<br />Decimating all uncertainty<br />Bowing to only who can place judgement upon me<br /><br />Give me your broken<br />give me your beaten<br />I will build them up <br />I will lead them<br />To The Threshold<br />Make you stronger<br />Make you believe<br />I am one in the same but now stronger than uncertainty<br />Within this army<br />This is more than a battle - cry<br />It's the blood of our lifeline<br />Flowing faster<br /><br />This is the sound of the lost, beaten and broken<br />Decimating all fears<br />Stronger than ever<br />Beyond every dream <br />Ascension into supremacy<br />Now we're stronger than ever<br />Harder than ever<br /><br />Give me your broken<br />give me your beaten<br />I will build them up <br />I will lead them<br />To The Threshold<br />To The Threshold<br />This is more than a battle - cry<br /><br />We were the broken <br />We were the beaten<br />I was once like you<br />Now I push myself to the threshold<br />Because I am stronger<br />Because I believe<br />Now I spit in the face of defeat<br />Now I'm stronger than all uncertainty{% endraw %}
