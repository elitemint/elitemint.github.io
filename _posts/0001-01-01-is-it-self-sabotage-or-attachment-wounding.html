{% raw %}There's a common misconception about having an anxious attachment style, an avoidant attachment style or a fearful-avoidant attachment style, which is that the associated behaviors are maladaptive. But this is only true *in a particular context.*<br /><br />What gets ignored too often in the attachment discourse is the strategic intelligence of our earliest impulses.
