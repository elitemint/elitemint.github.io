{% raw %}In today's tutorial I am showing you how to complete the invisible decrease for your next amigurumi project. Otherwise known as 'sc2tog' (single crochet two stitches together or 'dec' (decrease), this technique is very helpful for amigurumi (among other projects worked in the round), as it will ensure your stuffing doesn't show through!<br />I have done this at a beginner's pace, so hopefully this slow motion tutorial is helpful. Let me know down in the comments if you have any questions and if there are any beginner's  tutorials you would like to see.<br />Angela x<br /><br />If you would like to see how to complete a double crochet decrease (dc2tog) then head over to my other video here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/XtBhyrfZRUw">https://youtu.be/XtBhyrfZRUw</a><br /><br />//COME SAY HI:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/berceauknits/">https://www.instagram.com/berceauknits/</a><br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/berceauknits/">https://www.pinterest.co.uk/berceauknits/</a><br /><br />//VISIT MY SHOP:<br />Etsy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/berceauknits">https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/berceauknits</a><br /><br />//MATERIALS USED:<br />Clover Soft Touch Hook 2.5mm (C): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3d0UFW4">https://amzn.to/3d0UFW4</a><br />Ricorumi 100% Cotton DK Yarn: PINK <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3tC8aAz">https://amzn.to/3tC8aAz</a><br /><br />//MUSIC USED:<br />Epidemic Sound: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/es740p/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/es740p/</a><br /><br />//DISCLAIMER:<br />Links included in this description may be affiliate links.
