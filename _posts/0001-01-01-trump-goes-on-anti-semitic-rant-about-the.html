{% raw %}Donald Trump is no stranger to anti-semitic comments and viewpoints and he was at it again during a recent interview with journalist Barak Ravid. During the interview, Trump claimed that American Jewish people don’t care about the state of Israel, Congress was under &quot;absolute power&quot; of Israel until the Obama Administration, and that the New York Times is run by Jewish people that also hate Israel.

And they’re Jewish people that run The New York Times. I mean, the Sulzberger family.”&quot;<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/12/trump-israel-controlled-congress-jews-run-new-york-times-anti-semitism.html">https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/12/trump-israel-controlled-congress-jews-run-new-york-times-anti-semitism.html</a><br /><br />&quot;Donald Trump is the most openly anti-Semitic president in American history.
