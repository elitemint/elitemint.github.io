But under Â£300 is amazing for a luxury bag...<br /><br />What someone defines as a 'luxury bag' is very subjective.<br />In my teens I would have told you Fiorelli was exactly that.<br />Now the most important thing to me is quality.<br />I also think there is a minimum standard of presentation for such things- which is why I like to show the packaging and how it arrives.<br /><br />I try to be consistent with my reviews and do not seek to overly endorse or be overly negative about products. My aim on this channel is to provide reliable and helpful information to those wishing to purchase- whilst at the same time allowing myself to spend time talking about things I thoroughly enjoy.<br /> <br />This is not sponsored, and whilst I did reach out to the brand to ask for information after purchasing the bag... sadly I got no reply.<br /><br />Bag details: Cyme Mini.
