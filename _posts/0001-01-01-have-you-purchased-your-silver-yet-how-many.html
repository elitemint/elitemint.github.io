{% raw %}ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥How many of you have to have that Starbucks coffee or latte in the mornings?! Well did you know that 2 lattes cost the same as 1 ounce of silver? One thing Iâ€™ve learned over the years in developing wealth is that its not what you do one time, but its creating the right wealth habits. Remember spending is the opposite of investing, set up autosave for your silver today! I recommend 1-10 ounces per month, opposed to spending money on frivolous things that wonâ€™t make you money.ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.quicksilver.me/886682">https://www.quicksilver.me/886682</a>{% endraw %}
