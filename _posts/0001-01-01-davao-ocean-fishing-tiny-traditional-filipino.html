{% raw %}FROM FISHPONDS to ocean fishing.<br /><br />We are going out on the ocean in a 30 foot boat. Is this a good idea? I don't know. The destination: nearby in the Davao Gulf, and we are fishing sardines (tamban) off the Philippines coast. <br /><br />And it turned out to be a fun evening, ending with us eating tamban kinilaw on board!<br /><br />================<br />BRAND NEW MERCHANDISE!
