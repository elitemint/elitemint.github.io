{% raw %}Vans proudly presents Nice To See You, our first-ever globally collaborative skateboarding film that was created with help from the Vans skate team and talented filmmakers around the world. Nice To See You expresses the shared feeling of solidarity and commonality amongst skateboarders everywhere, regardless of location, background or identity. The film was produced under the guidance of Los Angeles-based renowned filmmaker and photographer Greg Hunt, with support from creative talents including Tommy Zhao, Shari White (who directed Vans’ Credits), Paul Labadie and Max Pack (who directed Vans Europe’s Tom’s Tales), George Kousoulis, Daniel Dent, and Kyota Kamei.<br /><br />Nice To See You stars: Adelaide Norris, Alexey Krasniy, Breana Geering, Chima Ferguson, Daiki Hoshino, Diego Todd, Digby Luxton, Dustin Henry, Etienne Gagne, Nick Michel, Notis Aggelis, Pedro Delfino, Rio Morishige, Ronnie Sandoval, Shogo Zama, Simon Zuzic, Una Farrar, and Wang Guohua, with appearances from many other Vans Family members.<br /><br />00:00 – 03:45 – Nick Michel<br />03:46 – 08:18 – Australia<br />08:19 – 12:41 – Ronnie Sandoval<br />12:42 – 15:16 – Alexey Krasniy<br />15:17 – 18:13 – Notis Aggelis<br />18:14 – 23:03– Japan<br />23:04 – 28:00 – Dustin Henry<br />28:01 – 33:22 - Diego Todd/Pedro Delfino<br />33:23 – 34:26 - Wang Guohua<br />34:27 – 37:18 - Breana Geering<br />37:19 – 43:13 – Chima Ferguson<br />43:14 - Credits<br /><br />MUSIC CREDITS<br />“NICE TO SEE YOU”<br />“Song About an Angel”<br />Written by Jeremy Enigk, William Goldsmith, Dan Hoerner, Nate Mendel<br />Published by Sub Pop Publishing / BMG Bumblebee obo Ironic Superlative Music, Northern Clam. &amp;
