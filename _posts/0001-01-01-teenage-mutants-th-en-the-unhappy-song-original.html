Teenage Mutants &amp; TH;EN - The Unhappy Song (Original Mix) <br />2. Teenage Mutants &amp; DBMM - Horn (Original Mix)  <br />3. Teenage Mutants &amp; TH;EN - Wrong  (Original Mix) <br />Teenage Mutants is back on Suara with &quot;The Unhappy EP&quot;. Although it may sound like we are talking about a sad release, it's not the case. &quot;The Unhappy Song&quot; is a very fresh track with an oriental touch and features a mix between a sitar and an acoustic guitar. &quot;Horn&quot; has this amazing and delicate male vocal that appears on the best moments of the track. Finally, &quot;Wrong&quot; is a melodic dancefloor focused cut begging to be dropped in dark techno clubs.<br />Again, the same formula: Teenage Mutants + Suara = Success<br />Artwork by GaAs<br />Mastering by www.pobla.es{% endraw %}
