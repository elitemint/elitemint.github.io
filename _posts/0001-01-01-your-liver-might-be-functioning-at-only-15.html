{% raw %}How you can clean up your external environment to re-activate your body’s self-healing processes and restore your gut health.<br /><br />In this episode of Bulletproof Radio, my guest is Dr. Edward Group, founder of the Global Healing Center. We talk about why disease and longevity begin in the gut and ways to keep your gut healthy through processes you’ve probably never heard of before.<br /><br />He’s “educating people on the root cause of disease and how they can clean up their external environment and how they can clean up their internal environment at the same time and take back control of their health and reactivate their body’s self-healing mechanism.”<br /><br />“Ninety percent of all the chemicals and toxins enter through the intestinal tract,” Dr. Group explains. He’s developed a unique form of oxygen to cleanse the digestive tract. This is paired with an active form of iodine that helps detoxify and helps repair any damaged tissue a lot faster.”<br /><br />Dr. Group’s background is in chiropractic and naturopathic care, nutrition and functional medicine, but he’s worked in all sorts of spaces in between. He’s closely followed the work of Tesla and even has his own “Men in Black”-type story from his early research work.<br /><br />We talk about his founding of the Global Healing Center, a nutrition and alternative medicine company that provides natural dietary/immune supplements and detox/cleanse programs, where he’s been CEO for 22 years. The Center’s began its own organic farm in 2009, which grew into a larger eco-manufacturing facility that makes products with pure, organic, and plant-based ingredients that can help you on your gut-healing journey.<br /><br />His personal mission is to teach and promote philosophies that produce good health, a clean environment, and positive thinking.<br /><br />Dr. Group has authored several publications and is a frequent guest on radio, TV programs and documentary films. He’s dedicated to helping others through his work and talks all about ways you can tune into greater healing on his YouTube Channel (with more than 25 million views).<br /><br />“Some of the cheapest, most effective things like diatomaceous activated charcoal, sunlight, water, meditation, these are all things that don’t cost any money yet have profound healing effects on the body,” Dr. Group says.<br /><br /><br />In this episode, Dr. Group and I cover a lot of ground. Everything from the intensity of the energy present in meditation to the ways you can profoundly heal your body. No matter your interest and knowledge in this topic, you’ll find something that resonates.<br /><br /><br />NEW BOOK! “Fast This Way: Burn Fat, Health Inflammation, and Eat Like the High Performing Human You Were Meant to Be”<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fastthisway.com">https://fastthisway.com</a><br /> <br />Connect with Dave Asprey!<br /> <br />Web: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://daveasprey.com/">https://daveasprey.com/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dave.asprey/">https://www.instagram.com/dave.asprey/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bulletproofexecutive/">https://www.facebook.com/bulletproofexecutive/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/bulletproofexec">https://twitter.com/bulletproofexec</a><br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DaveAspreyBPR">https://www.youtube.com/c/DaveAspreyBPR</a><br />Bulletproof Radio: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://daveasprey.com/category/podcasts/">https://daveasprey.com/category/podcasts/</a><br />Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://daveasprey.com/blog/">https://daveasprey.com/blog/</a>{% endraw %}
