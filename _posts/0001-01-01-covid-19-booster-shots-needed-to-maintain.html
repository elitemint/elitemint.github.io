{% raw %}From Feb 14, those aged 18 and above in Singapore will have to take a booster shot in order to maintain a fully vaccinated status against COVID-19, the multi-ministry task force announced on Wednesday (Jan 5).<br />The new rule will apply to those whose final vaccine dose was taken on May 20 last year or before, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cna.asia/3JIQ1dy">https://cna.asia/3JIQ1dy</a><br /><br />Mr Ong said Singapore must brace for a “much bigger” COVID-19 infection wave from Omicron compared to that from the Delta variant, even as studies show infections from the Omicron variant are less severe than that of Delta. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cna.asia/3JTDVyq">https://cna.asia/3JTDVyq</a><br /><br />Minister Lawrence Wong added that Singapore &quot;may have no choice but to tighten&quot; restrictions if the virus’ transmission is amplified by &quot;unnecessary risk&quot;. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cna.asia/3mZd5em">https://cna.asia/3mZd5em</a><br /><br />Meanwhile, primary care doctors, such as general practitioners, will now have more discretion to assess if their COVID-19 patients can recover in the community or should be referred to care facilities. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cna.asia/3EUoqT1">https://cna.asia/3EUoqT1</a><br /><br />This is a recording of the full news conference, including the Q&amp;A session with journalists.<br /><br />Subscribe to our channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cna.asia/youtubesub">https://cna.asia/youtubesub</a> <br /><br /><br /><br />Subscribe to our news service on Telegram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cna.asia/telegram">https://cna.asia/telegram</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Follow us:<br /><br />CNA: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cna.asia">https://cna.asia</a><br /><br />CNA Lifestyle: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.cnalifestyle.com">http://www.cnalifestyle.com</a> <br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/channelnewsasia">https://www.facebook.com/channelnewsasia</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/channelnewsasia">https://www.instagram.com/channelnewsasia</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia">https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia</a>{% endraw %}
