{% raw %}Friday after work the lads set out on a overnight mission, out to great barrier island. Soft baiting the afternoon at little barrier landing a few snappers the bite died out and we made a quick move to great barrier to anchor down for the night. After catching countless sharks we land the fish we came for. Waking up early in the morning we got to little Barrier for a quick coffee then we resumed to our fishing. <br /><br />Churr to the bro @dappabeats for his fire tune LIKE THAT listen here  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/dappabeatss">https://soundcloud.com/dappabeatss</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1We2XdgnoHFnqVIeRlgEt9?si=nHdamU7qRROGVPVrhuDhqg&amp;nd=1">https://open.spotify.com/artist/1We2XdgnoHFnqVIeRlgEt9?si=nHdamU7qRROGVPVrhuDhqg&amp;nd=1</a><br /><br />Shout out to the bros home brew <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylhKINXyiws">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylhKINXyiws</a>{% endraw %}
