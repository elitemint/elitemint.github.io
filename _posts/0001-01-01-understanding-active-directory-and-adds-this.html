{% raw %}This video gives you a brief Active Directory (AD) is a directory service that Microsoft developed for Windows domain networks. It is included in most Windows Server operating systems as a set of processes and services.A server running Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) is called a domain controller. It authenticates and authorizes all users and computers in a Windows domain type networkâ€”assigning and enforcing security policies for all computers and installing or updating software. For example, when a user logs into a computer that is part of a Windows domain, Active Directory checks the submitted password and determines whether the user is a system administrator or normal user. Also, it allows management and storage of information, provides authentication and authorization mechanisms, and establishes a framework to deploy other related services: Certificate Services, Federated Services, Lightweight Directory Services and Rights Management Services.<br />For more details you can visit us on the following links:<br /><br />Website : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.techetimes.com">http://www.techetimes.com</a><br /><br />Facebook Page : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TechETimes/">https://www.facebook.com/TechETimes/</a><br /><br />LinkedIn Profile : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/teche-times-890152157/of">https://www.linkedin.com/in/teche-times-890152157/of</a> what is AD and ADDS.<br /><br />Twitter : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TechETimes">https://twitter.com/TechETimes</a>{% endraw %}
