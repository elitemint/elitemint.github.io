{% raw %}► Historical Then And Now Photos, Locations and Cities<br />► Hello everyone and welcome back to Mystery Scoop.<br />In this unique video presentation, we compare historical Then and Now photos of the same locations, to observe how much the world has changed or perhaps remained the same. In some cases, the changes are enormous and almost unbelievable. The buildings, transportation, and clothing of the people appear to be vastly different. In other cases, landscapes have remained practically unchanged while people and technology have seen significant changes. Let's have a look at a few carefully selected scenes for this video. Let us know in the comments section below which change you found most compelling.<br /><br />Please check the video to see comparison photos showing how the world has changed, as seen via rephotography and juxtaposed images.<br /><br />Featured in this video:<br />00:00 Locations Then And Now, Intro<br />00:45 D-Day, Normandy, France, 1944 vs 2014<br />01:13 Osnabruck, Germany, 1904 vs 2016<br />01:41 Osnabruck Central Railway Station, Germany, 1965 vs 2015<br />02:09 Nowomiejska Street, Lodz, Poland, 1874 vs 2016<br />02:37 Paris, France, 1900 vs 2017<br />03:05 Szyperska Street, Poznan, Poland, 2006 vs 2017<br />03:33 Kjeasen Railway Bridge, Norway, 1927 vs 2008<br />04:01 The Grand Garden Palace, Dresden, Germany, 1900 vs 2005<br />04:29 St. Matthew Evangelical Church, Lodz, Poland, 1937 vs 2017<br />04:57 Osnabruck, Germany, 1953 vs 2015<br />05:25 St Gervais et St Protais, France, 1918 vs 2017<br />05:53 Karlstor, Munich, Germany, 1910 vs 2017<br />06:21 Koln Domplatte, Germany, 1945 vs 2011<br />06:49 Gymnasium, Osnabruck, Germany, 1870 vs 2015<br />07:17 Lodz, Poland, 1887 vs 2015<br /><br />Watch more Then and Now photos:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuCx3d-8mGB0YkhscgfHl28lDat83qQC-">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuCx3d-8mGB0YkhscgfHl28lDat83qQC-</a><br /><br />Image source:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OldPhotosInRealLife/">https://www.reddit.com/r/OldPhotosInRealLife/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.re.photos/en/">https://www.re.photos/en/</a><br />Licence: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a><br />---------<br />If you have enjoyed the video, please show some love by LIKING, COMMENTING and SUBSCRIBING to my channel!<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />#MysteryScoop #Juxtaposed #ThenNow #BeforeAfter #Locations #Time #Changes #RePhotography #OldNew #Cities<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />For any Copyright issues, please reach out to us first before filing a claim with YouTube.
