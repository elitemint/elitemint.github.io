{% raw %}Reach us and request an online demonstration of the UAV gimbal. You will see a video stream and will be in touch with our representative to control the mission! Our team will arrange an actual flight and demonstrate all camera system features in real-time, so you can judge gimbal performance on your own. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ukrspecsystems.com/drone-gimbals/usg-400">https://ukrspecsystems.com/drone-gimbals/usg-400</a><br /><br />USG-400 is a high-performance gyro-stabilized camera system for UAVs, drones, crewed aircraft. It combines industry-proven EO, uncooled IR, LRF, navigation sensors in a small package. USG-400 camera gimbal has superb stabilization performance, accurate coordinates acquisition, high-range monitoring capability, nearly perfect target tracking capability in any weather conditions.<br /><br />Another big part of the package is our mission control software. It allows you to plan your surveillance mission, makes the process of information collection much easier, and gives you tools to analyze your task after the flight and collect additional information. <br /><br />Aerowatcher software simplifies most of the common tasks that are being done by the sensor operator, allowing them to perform missions much faster. It has a full set of geo-referred features. For example, you can quickly get coordinates of the target, or click on the map to view at the selected point, or add geo-referred landmarks on the map with photos from the camera gimbal. It also supports multiple input methods (like keyboard+mouse, joysticks, control units) and allows sharing information in real-time with other team members, either with people on the ground or in the HQ. <br /><br />Altogether, we are talking about an all-in-one turnkey solution for long-range surveillance. It is suitable for Class 1 and Class 2 UAVs, small human-crewed aircraft, or helicopter installations. Everything you need to integrate and operate USG-400 gimbal is already included in the package, and you wonâ€™t need to buy any extra equipment. We know that many gimbals cost extremely expensive, so one of our goals was to make USG-400 reasonably priced and cost-effective while not compromising the performance.<br /><br />For more information visit our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ukrspecsystems.com">https://ukrspecsystems.com</a>{% endraw %}
