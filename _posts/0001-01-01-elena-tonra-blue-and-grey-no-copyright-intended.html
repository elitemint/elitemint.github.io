{% raw %}No copyright intended, I couldn't find this song on youtube so after over an hour of searching online, I found it and decided to share it with everyone else who maybe looking for it.<br /><br />Lyrics: one day there was a girl, who cried tears of pearls, her eyes were blue and green, like none I've ever seen. She met a man that night, who filled her with delight, and he spoke in poetry and rhyme, and she loved him in no time. Then he changed and then soon he became, jealous of her beauty and fame, so he locked her away and he forced her to play songs that were blue and songs that were grey. One day this lonely girl had had enough of her world, so she climbed to the top of the tallest tower and stood there for way over an hour, until she decided she'd jump. So she jumped with a very loud thump. And all of the neighbours they came out and cried when they discovered that this poor girl had died and the boy he just stood there and gasped, at this beauty asleep on the grass, and her eyes were like none he had seen, except for the girls in his dreams. Then he changed and then soon he became, depressed and very very strange. He'd lock himself away for days and days and play songs that were blue and play songs that were grey, he'd play songs that reminded him of that day. One day there was a girl who fell in love with a boy in a different world, and she speaks to him at night only in a certain light. She wore white and he wore black and they were like a perfect match. Though one was dead and one was alive, through many years their love did survive, till time faded and soon they became both exactly the same. And both are floating In the sky singing their own lullaby to a song that reminds them of a past time a song that reminds them of a past day (a song that is blue a song that is grey) x3{% endraw %}
