Rainbow Blvd # 270<br />Las Vegas, NV 89103<br /><br />This is my riskiest investment ever and this is my speculative plan to become a millionaire with NFTs - specifically with the OMI cryptocurrency which is my third largest position behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. OMI powers one of the coolest NFT apps I’ve ever seen.<br /><br />MY DISCLOSURE: <br />I invested $150,000 at the beginning of this year almost at the peak $0.009 which subsequently went down to $16,000. I never paper sold. I speculate someday it could be worth millions of dollars.<br /><br />WHAT IS VEVE?<br />The ECOMI team (which is the company that launched this) started to buy licenses in 2017 when no one even heard of what NFTs were - they hired Al Khan who brought North America shows like Yu-Gi-Oh, Pokemon and Ninja Turtles. Just recently they announced their Disney partnership which also includes licenses for brands like Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and much more. <br /><br />Together in collaboration with those brands, they started to create carbon neutral Licensed Premium Digital Collectibles that most us used to collect but all of these exist only in the digital world -  these collectibles are called NFTs. <br /><br />WHAT IS AN NFT?<br />NFT stands for non fungible token which is a unique digital asset that uses the blockchain to establish immutable ownership over digital assets.<br /><br />VEVE SELLS NFTS?<br />They have two main types of NFTs - comic books and digital collectibles. As of right now, the Ecomi team releases a comic book every Tuesday and Thursday at 8am standard pacific time. They retail for $6.99 - using something called Gems - 1 Gem = $1, and every gem is underpinned by the OMI token.<br /><br />They also do collectible drops which is an actual 3D model. When they release a collectible like Superman for example - it is only that one time - it’s unique and once it sells out - it will never be sold again. The only way to buy it once it's sold out is in the marketplace (in the VeVe app).<br /><br />HOW ARE PEOPLE MAKING MONEY WITH NFTs?<br />People compete to buy a collectible which they will either hold on to in hopes that the investment goes up in value or they will sell for an easy 10x profit (if it's a desirable NFT).<br /><br />Getting an NFT at retail prices is very difficult because there are several hundred thousand users on the platform competing for the same thing. <br /><br />HOW DOES OMI PLAY INTO THIS?<br />The highest gaining crypto of 2021 was OMI. Even more than Shib, more than Doge. It gained 16,366%, 163x from January 1st to today. If you had bought $10,000 of OMI on January 1st, you would have $1.63 million dollars. OMI is supposed to underpin the whole ecosystem of VeVe, unfortunately - it is almost impossible to buy this token.<br /><br />WHY DO YOU THINK IT WILL GO UP IN VALUE?<br />1. The migration to the Ethereum - once that happens OMI will have a lot more interoperability. This means they will also hopefully be listed on bigger exchanges like Binance, ImmutableX (a layer 2 solution for NFTs), and maybe they could get listed on Coinbase. <br /><br />2. SHIB’s 24 hour trading volume $7.75 billion - with over a hundred trading pairs. OMI has a 24 hour trading volume of $10 million with only 5 trading pairs. The entire SHIBA INU project is worth around $36.6 billion dollar, and OMI is worth only $1.3 billion. <br /><br />This means SHIB has 775 times more trading volume and is 28 times more valuable than a project that acquired some of the biggest licenses in the world with arguably the coolest app of NFTs in the market. I believe OMI is significantly undervalued. If OMI can match SHIB's market cap, each coin will be worth 17 cents and my position will be worth $2.75.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THE RISKS?<br />Watch the video to find out because no project is perfect but this is one of my favorite speculative investments that I believe has a good chance of paying off for taking the risk.<br /><br />*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.
