{% raw %}Goodland is a fun channel where ordinary objects come to life!  Here chewing gum, toothpaste, as well as vegetables and fruits can talk and joke with each other.  And an ordinary sugar cube saves itself from impending doom, from falling into a cup of hot coffee.  As you can see, these little things lead their secret life, like ours.  They are also born and die.  But such short videos can really cheer you up even on the worst of days!  Our channel proves that from time to time you can discover a whole new world for yourself, even among the simplest items.  All you need is a different look at simple things!<br /><br /><br /><br />Smile.  Enjoy watching!<br /><br />#cutedoodles #doodles #reallifedoodles{% endraw %}
