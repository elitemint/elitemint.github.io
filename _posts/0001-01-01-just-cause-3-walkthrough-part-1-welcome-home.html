This Just Cause 3 walkthrough will be completed showcasing every level, mission, boss, and story ending. <br /><br />PC Specs: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/p/jNJp4D">http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/p/jNJp4D</a><br /><br />Story<br /><br />Set several years after the events of Just Cause 2, Rico Rodriguez leaves The Agency and returns to his homeland of Medici, a fictional Mediterranean island under the brutal control of dictator General Di Ravello who has set his eyes on world domination. Wanting to stop him, Rico goes on a journey to destroy his evil plans<br /><br />Gameplay<br /><br />Just Cause 3 is an open world third-person action-adventure game that will be set on a fictional Mediterranean island known as Medici with Rico Rodriguez set as the protagonist. The map size has been confirmed to be similar to that of the setting of Just Cause 2 with 400 square miles (1,000 km2) being dedicated for the new setting. However, its volumetric terrain has increased to allow more verticality – as a result of this, it is now possible for the player to explore subterranean caverns and to scale buildings more effectively and realistically. The world of the game is composed of five major biomes, with each having unique landmarks and landscapes.<br /><br />A variety of tools will be provided to players for traversal in the game. Just Cause 2‍ '​s signature features – the grappling hook and parachute – will be re-appearing with improved mechanics. The focus on chaos and exaggerated physics will also remain. A new wingsuit, which is permanently equipped by the player, will be featured in the game and allow players to glide across the world in a much faster way. When the player almost reaches the ground while utilizing the wingsuit, they can draw themselves back up in the air by utilizing grapples. Players can switch between utilizing the parachute and wingsuit freely during missions or free-roam. In addition to the equipment provided, a wide range of weapons, like missile launchers and shotgun RPGs, and vehicles, such as fighter aircraft, planes, ships, and exotic cars, will be included in the game. These vehicles can be customized by the player and can be used as weapons.<br /><br />Other game mechanics have been overhauled and updated. For example, Rico now has the ability to attach and tether multiple objects together with his grappling hook, while parachuting is made more stable and allows players to shoot enemies from the air. Every object and non-playable character can also be hooked by the player with the use of the grappling hook. In-game currency has been left out of Just Cause 3, making the series' supply drops more easily accessible and imaginative for the player. However, this affects difficulty; for example, if the player chooses to ride a tank, the enemy AI will match the power of it and adopt weapons that would be able to take down a tank. Another new feature is giving the character infinite C4. Unlike previous installments that required players to purchase C4; Just Cause 3 instates this weapon to allow for more chaos. In Just Cause 2 players were able to stand on top of moving vehicles but only in the center; players are now allowed to move around on freely in Just Cause 3.[ Players can invade hostile military bases and towns featured in the game; they will act as fast travel locations if the invasion is successful.<br /><br />Creativity and destruction are heavily emphasized in Just Cause 3. For instance, many things in the game, including structures like bridges and statues, can be destroyed in a variety of ways.  A new mechanic called Rebel Drop will be introduced. It allows the player to pause the game to select equipment, weapons, and vehicles, through a pause menu. The selected objects will be dropped into the game's world and can be used by players. The game will feature Challenge Modes. It includes mini-games like wingsuit races and the destruction frenzy mode, in which new objectives and challenges will be unlocked when the player destroys an enemy base.<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1NYsK7D">http://bit.ly/1NYsK7D</a><br />Twitter Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/TetraNinja">http://twitter.com/TetraNinja</a><br />Facebook Fan Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://on.fb.me/kxJqjN">http://on.fb.me/kxJqjN</a><br />TwitchTV : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitch.tv/tetraninja">http://www.twitch.tv/tetraninja</a><br />YouTube Channel Extension App: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/13nAV0H">http://bit.ly/13nAV0H</a><br /><br />Developer: Avalanche Studios<br />Release: 12/01/2015<br />Genre: Action Adventure<br />Platforms: PlayStation 4 (PS4), XBOX One (XB1), Windows PC<br />Publisher: Square-Enix{% endraw %}
