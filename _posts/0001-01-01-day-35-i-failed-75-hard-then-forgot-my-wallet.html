{% raw %}15 Days into the 75 Hard program and I failed. The reason being just shows how hard this program actually is. <br /><br />I will say that in only 2 weeks it already reminded me how disciplined one can be and how beneficial it is. <br /><br />We are off to Cincinnati for the Championship Game, then we get to the airport before realizing I left my wallet and ID at home. <br /><br />Already a rough start to the morning but I canâ€™t let that set the time for the day. <br /><br />Follow Me On Instagram For More Behind The Scenes<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/anthonywfarrer/">https://www.instagram.com/anthonywfarrer/</a>{% endraw %}
