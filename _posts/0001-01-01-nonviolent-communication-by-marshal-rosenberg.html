It is not about convincing people to do what we want but to create a connection with another person where everyone’s needs are met. <br /><br />In the book, Rosenberg shares with us a better way of communicating with others. He calls it NonViolent Communication - a language of life! <br /><br />Communication is a fundamental building block of everyday life. If we want to function well in society, we need to learn to communicate effectively with the people surrounding us. <br /><br />Often when we communicate with others – irrational conflicts and misunderstandings arise, and we end up leaving conversations feeling disregarded or in despair. <br /><br />This is where NonViolent Communication enters the stage. At its core is the belief that all human beings have the capacity for compassion and empathy. We only resort to harmful behavior when we don’t identify more effective strategies.<br /><br />We hope you will enjoy the video!
