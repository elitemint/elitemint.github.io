Past performance is not indicative of future results. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. IPDATrader is not a professional forex trader, by no way is he saying you can achieve the same results as him. His results are not typical for just any trader to achieve. However, they are very possible. They are the result of long-term trading, none of these results shall come overnight. It takes time, but can definitely be done by a serious trader. Trade at your own risk, IPDATrader is not responsible. <br />Credits to ICT for making the Smart Money-side of trading public, huge inspiration to me: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/InnerCircleTrader">https://www.youtube.com/c/InnerCircleTrader</a><br /><br />===========================================================<br /><br />#forex #forextrader #bitcoin #trading #forextrading #money #forexsignals #trader #cryptocurrency #forexlifestyle #investment #business #entrepreneur #investing #crypto #invest #blockchain #forexmarket #forexlife #success #bitcoinmining #fx #stocks #investor #daytrader #btc #forexsignal<br /><br />Timestamps:<br />00:00 The Only Smart Money Strategy You Will Ever Need in Forex<br />00:52 4 Core Principles Of The Strategy<br />01:30 Step 1-Structure<br />07:02 Step 2,3 - Liquidity and POI<br />11:50 Step 4 - Confirmation<br />15:57 Trade-Example Using The Strategy{% endraw %}
