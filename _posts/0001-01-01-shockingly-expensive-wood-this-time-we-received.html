{% raw %}This time we received an order to cut into slabs a huge expensive log of bog oak, about 5,000 years old. The result is slabs 7 meters long and weighing about 1 ton. Bog oak, a unique material that nature took thousands of years to create. Bog oak is extracted from the depths of rivers and swamps in those places where oak grew many thousands of years ago. <br />Black stained oak is a noble, rare and valuable type of wood. No wonder its mining is compared with the development of deposits of precious stones and metals. This is a troublesome and expensive process, which certainly affects the final price of the product. For several centuries, elite furniture has been produced from bogged black oak, which adorns expensive offices, aristocratic salons and museums.<br /><br />You have never seen such a Bog Oak!
