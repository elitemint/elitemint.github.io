{% raw %}The Soviet Union survived its tumultuous first post-revolutionary years of civil war and imperialist invasion, but found itself isolated in a hostile, capitalist-dominated world. The Soviet government embarked on an all-out campaign of industrialization and collectivization that achieved a pace of economic development unparalleled in human history. But at the same time, the menace of fascism was rising, and the leadership of the Communist Party struggled through a string of shifts and policy reversals in international politics. In the end, 27 million Soviet citizens gave their lives in World War Two to defeat the Nazi war machine.  <br /><br />To discuss this period from the 1920s to the onset of World War II, Brian is joined by Carlos Martinez, author of “The End of the Beginning: Lessons of the Soviet Collapse,” co-founder of the No Cold War Campaign, and editor of the political analysis site Invent-The-Future.org. <br /><br />This is part 3 of the series “The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Union -- Lessons for Socialists.” <br /><br />Part 1 with Carlos Martinez: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Fb5grDNww6U">https://youtu.be/Fb5grDNww6U</a><br />Part 2 with Vijay Prashad: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Nnm19i0PMig">https://youtu.be/Nnm19i0PMig</a>{% endraw %}
