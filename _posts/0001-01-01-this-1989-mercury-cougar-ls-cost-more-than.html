Well, it wasn't quite that bad, but not far off.<br /><br />The MN 12 was much more substantial than at first look - it was a RWD platform, with 4-wheel independent suspension - and absolute rarity at e time with the exception of much higher-end European cars.<br /><br />It shared the platform with the Ford Thunderbird, which had been a sibling of the Cougar for many years, and also a variant of the MN12 rode underneath the Lincoln Mark VIII - but that was it.  $2 Billion to make just three cars, two of which competed against each other - it's hard to imagine Ford didn't have bigger plans for a return on their investment.<br /><br />This is a review of a very well kept and original 1989 Mercury Cougar LS  The review is by Bill of Curious Cars, and the car is for sale at Autohaus of Naples - on the web at www.AutoausNapls.com, or by phone at (239) 263-8500.{% endraw %}
