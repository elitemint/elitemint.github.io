The biggest BMW ever produced and arguably the most in your face! The m50d model starts from £85,000, but with the Visibility and Technology packages, the extras add £17,000, totally £107,000.<br /><br />The 4th generation Range Rover is being replaced by a new one next year, but this generation doesn't feel outdated. Tiff and Paul don't like the touchscreen, though! This one, with the Black Pack and big, 21 inch wheels costs over £100,000.<br /><br />Pendine Sands is a 7 mile long stretch of beach, famous for land speed record attempts, so it's only fair that we drag race these two SUV heavyweights, but on Lovecars, we like drag races with a difference. Starting with a low range drag race, which is handy for the X7, as it doesn't have a low gear ratio!<br /><br />Both cars handle both on and off the road, and Paul and Tiff test both, not that the owners of these cars will take them off road regularly!<br /><br />Which do you prefer? Let's hope the new Range Rover is even better! <br /><br />#Lovecars #Automotive #SUV<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/593tfpab">https://tinyurl.com/593tfpab</a> // Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lovecars.com/">https://lovecars.com/</a><br /><br />Follow Lovecars<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/2p96j2tu">https://tinyurl.com/2p96j2tu</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/e5sejhpe">https://tinyurl.com/e5sejhpe</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/3bw34cjd">https://tinyurl.com/3bw34cjd</a><br /><br />Follow the Lovecars Team:<br />Tiff: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/4nrdunb3">https://tinyurl.com/4nrdunb3</a><br />Paul: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/bdz24fs7">https://tinyurl.com/bdz24fs7</a><br /><br />Watch more videos!<br />Newest Videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/36cv9x97">https://tinyurl.com/36cv9x97</a><br />Aston Martin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/ezx9hyex">https://tinyurl.com/ezx9hyex</a><br />Hot Hatch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/2utnvzfh">https://tinyurl.com/2utnvzfh</a><br />Most Popular: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/2p8vk5at">https://tinyurl.com/2p8vk5at</a>{% endraw %}
