{% raw %}Ever wanted to implement facial recognition or verification into your application?<br /><br />In this series you'll learn how to build a deep facial recognition application to authenticate into an application. You'll start off by building a model using Deep Learning with Tensorflow which replicates what is shown in the paper titled Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition. Once that's all trained you'll be able to integrate it into a Kivy app and actually authenticate!<br /><br />Get the code: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://github.com/nicknochnack/FaceRecognition">https://github.com/nicknochnack/FaceRecognition</a><br />Final App: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://github.com/nicknochnack/FaceIDApp">https://github.com/nicknochnack/FaceIDApp</a><br /><br />Links<br />Paper: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf">https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf</a><br />Labelled Faces in the Wild: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/">http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/</a><br /><br />Chapters: <br />0:00 - Start<br />0:43 - Setting Up Tensorflow and Keras for Deep Learning<br />24:35 - Collecting Image Samples and Using the LFW Dataset<br />1:08:06 - Loading Images into the Tensorflow Dataloader<br />1:51:25 - Building a Siamese Neural Network<br />2:38:55 - Building a Custom Training Loop with tf.GradientTape<br />3:10:00 -  Testing the Model on Images<br />3:40:37 - Integrating with OpenCV<br />4:18:40 - Building the Kivy App and Integrating with Tensorflow<br /><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/324Epgo">https://bit.ly/324Epgo</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3mB1sZD">https://bit.ly/3mB1sZD</a><br />GitHub: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3mDJllD">https://bit.ly/3mDJllD</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2OCn3UW">https://bit.ly/2OCn3UW</a><br />Join the Discussion on Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3dQiZsV">https://bit.ly/3dQiZsV</a><br /><br />Happy coding!<br />Nick<br /><br />P.s.
