People use rosemary as tea. They also use it in their food, marinades, stews, soups, and food preservatives. Rosemary is even used in certain cosmetics. <br /><br />Rosemary has some very interesting properties, mainly from rosmarinic acid. Rosmarinic acid is the main phytonutrient in rosemary, and it has some really cool effects. <br /><br />Rosemary can help stimulate hair growth when used as an oil and applied to the scalp. One study showed a significant change when using rosemary to help inhibit cognitive decline. Another study showed that rosemary can increase insulin sensitivity and help with weight loss. Rosemary is also neuroprotective. <br /><br />There are potential benefits when using rosemary for: <br /> • Epilepsy <br /> • Pain relief <br /> • Infertility<br /> • Anxiety <br /> • Constipation <br /> • Muscle pain <br /> • Diabetes <br /> • Inflammation <br /> <br />If you have insulin resistance, which is very common, rosemary is a very good herb to use in your food on a regular basis. <br /><br />Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:<br />Dr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis &amp; Intermittent Fasting.
