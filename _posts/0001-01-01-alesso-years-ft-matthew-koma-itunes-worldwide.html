After being premiered on Swedish House Mafia's takeover of Pete Tong's Radio 1 show earlier this year the instrumental version of 'Years' immediately had EDM fans excited, and now Alesso is set to release the highly anticipated vocal version of the track featuring Matthew Koma on 4th August. Energized by the optimistic swoon of Koma's lyrics, Alesso's production shines as the shimmering piano melodies explode in a flurry of driving drums and uplifting, anthemic synths that are destined to soundtrack the summer and ignite festivals all over the world.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/refunerecords">https://www.facebook.com/refunerecords</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AlessoOfficial">https://www.facebook.com/AlessoOfficial</a>{% endraw %}
