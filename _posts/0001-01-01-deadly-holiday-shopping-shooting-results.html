{% raw %}Holiday shoppers at Burlington in North Hollywood were forced to evacuate when an assault turned deadly, as LAPD officers killed the armed suspect, as well as one innocent bystander, a 14-year-old girl in a dressing room. The latter has been attributed to what is likely from a stray bullet fired by an officer's fire arm.{% endraw %}
