It heightened image issues the league was facing at the time so commissioner David Stern made the NBA the first major sports league to have a dress code.

Today, players are in the front row of fashion shows and there are more eyes on NBA fashion than any other league.<br /><br />Shot using: Rode NT1 Condenser Microphone, 4K Video Downloader, and QuickTime Screen Recording <br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />I do not own any of the videos, photos or music used in this video.
