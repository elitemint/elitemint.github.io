{% raw %}IntenseAngler's &quot;Tip Of The Week&quot; - Episode 9.  How to accurately determine your position with a map and compass. This navigation tip is not only a useful outdoor skill to have, but one which may be a life saver as well. This week's tip is brought to you by our special guest host, Paul from BCoutdoorsurvival. Thank you  Paul.<br /><br />About &quot;Tip Of The Week&quot;:<br />In this new weekly series we will be sharing some wide-ranging outdoor centered tips, tricks, ideas, and &quot;how-to'&quot; videos in a short, concise, and to-the-point manner. A new video will be posted every Friday (as interest dictates). <br /><br />As part of this new series, I will be featuring a different channel each week in the &quot;intro&quot; segment of the video.
