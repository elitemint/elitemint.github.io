{% raw %}The IONIQ 5 is a big, heavy car. How does it fare at high speeds? And just how fast can it charge?<br /><br />Just a few days after getting the IONIQ 5, we went to the fantastic Fully Charged Outside event. Here’s how the car performed at 70mph/113km speeds in good weather with a charging stop on the way back home.<br /><br />I was expecting much worse efficiency than this so I suppose I was pleasantly surprised. Cold weather efficiency videos will come soon.<br /><br />There will also be a video of Flaviana at Fully Charged by the way — this is just me, sorry!<br /><br />Stats if you can’t be bothered to watch…<br /><br />Outward journey (no air con, tailwind): 3.5 miles/kWh  /  17.8 kWh/100km<br />Return journey (with air con, headwind): 3.2 miles/kWh  /  19.4 kWh/100km<br /><br /><br />Tweet me: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/tillathenun">https://twitter.com/tillathenun</a><br /><br /><br />Please support the channel!
