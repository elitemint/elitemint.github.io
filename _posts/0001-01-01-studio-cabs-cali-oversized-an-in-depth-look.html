{% raw %}Join Nolly and Rabea in part 1 of our in-depth video series in which they demonstrate our Studio Cabs: Cali Oversized plugin, talking guitar tone and giving background information as they go.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------<br /><br />GGD Studio Cabs: Cali Oversized is available now! Get it here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ggd.news/StudioCabsCali">https://ggd.news/StudioCabsCali</a><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Studio Cabs: Cali Oversized Edition is the second in our Studio Cabs series, and is a deep dive into what is potentially the most famous recording 4x12 of our time, renowned for its amazing smoothness, rich midrange and tight low end under the microphone. These attributes make it particularly suited to overdriven and high gain tones where they sound simply huge and pretty much mix-ready.<br /><br />Capturing the tones for this was a labor of love for us - we’ve been obsessed with the sounds these cabs make for decades, but when Nolly started working as a producer he quickly found that not all of them have “the sound”. It turns out to get that iconic tone you need to track down golden examples from the 90s and early 2000s, so that’s what he did, amassing well over a dozen from that time period and auditioning countless individual speakers on top of that. <br /><br />We chose only the 6 very best sounding speakers from his collection to capture for this plugin. Each was captured with 8 microphone options: 57, both vintage and modern 421 variants, two ribbons, two condensers and also an authentically-captured dual 57 Fredman array. <br /><br />For all except the latter you can sweep the mic position across the sweet spot of each speaker using the Dark to Bright knob. The usable range for each microphone was carefully defined with each speaker separately, meaning that you can’t go wrong anywhere on the dial. Just adjust to preference. The plugin also has an intuitive Master EQ switch that subtly filters, sweetens and adds clarity, if you feel you need to add a touch of polish. <br /><br />We’ve kept the popular .wav export function from our Zilla cabinet edition if you want to export you favourite IR blends to use with other devices, and you can load 3rd party IRs within the plugin too, though we hope you find everything you need within the cabinets we’ve captured.<br /><br />We’re extremely proud of this plugin, and frankly wish we’d had it at our disposal many years ago - it would have saved a lot of time and heartache chasing the perfect guitar tone. We really hope it gives you as much enjoyment as we had making it.<br /><br />Videography by Josh Gurner{% endraw %}
