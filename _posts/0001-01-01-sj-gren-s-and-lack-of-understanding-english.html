{% raw %}Lack of understanding with Sjögren's.<br /><br /><br />Sjögren's syndrome is a hard-hitting disease which is mostly invisible. It's an systemic auto-immune disease with many symptoms, which vary in severity.  That ensures that really only your doctor and fellow patients understand what you are going through. This is why the National Sjögren's Patients Association of the Netherlands made this film about lack of understanding. <br /><br />Subtitles made possible by Tramédico, Lauren Reinhoudt.<br /><br /><br />.{% endraw %}
