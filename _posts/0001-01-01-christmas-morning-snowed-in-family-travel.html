{% raw %}We journeyed home from Africa on Qatar Airways in their incredible QSuite. It made a 17 hour flight with 3 kids not just survivable, BUT ENJOYABLE! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.qatarairways.com/">https://www.qatarairways.com/</a><br /><br />This year we gifted families trips home to see their loved ones for Christmas. We are grateful for our partners IHG Hotels and Resorts. They have wonderful brands like Intercontinental, Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza, so please check them out for your next epic adventure! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ihg.com/">https://www.ihg.com/</a><br /><br />We ourselves haven’t been “home” in Colorado for 2 years so we went to surprise our family! We flew to Colorado to see family for a few days and then took off in search of SNOW! Boy, did we find it in Lake Tahoe! We enjoyed a wonderful and cozy Christmas as a family. We are so grateful for this precious time together with our young children and we will cherish these memories forever. We hope you had a wonderful Christmas and holiday season. We have more snowy Lake Tahoe adventures ahead! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.visitrenotahoe.com/">https://www.visitrenotahoe.com/</a><br /><br />Much Love,<br />The Bucket List Family<br /><br />/// OTHER VIDEOS :<br /><br />WHAT'S INSIDE??
