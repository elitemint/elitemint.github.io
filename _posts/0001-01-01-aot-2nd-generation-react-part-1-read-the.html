{% raw %}The reactions was a bit off aaah 😵<br />Btw i don't recommend giving suggestions since I already planned for what they are going to react to. <br /><br />Characters (mine,not canon):<br />Mizuki Kirstein<br />Emma Kirstein<br />Akio Arlert<br />Hina Reiss<br />Haruko<br />.<br />Ships in this video:<br />YumiHisu<br />(LeviHan,EreMika and Aruani will be on the next part!) <br />. <br />I'm really sorry if there are any mistakes here! I know this is really cringy and stuff, I'm not rlly good at making aot reactions since this is my first time <br />. <br />Now I'll just answer questions that y'all are probably going to ask <br />. <br />&quot;Why did levi adopt haruko tho?&quot; <br />Because levi actually took in/took care of Haruko before he adopt her because he found her in the streets when she was still a baby,later on he decided to adopt Haruko because she reminded him of hange.<br />PS.Her personalities,looks are almost like past (SS1-3) hange<br />. <br />&quot;Why won't mikasa told her children about eren?&quot;<br />She actually did,but all she said was that eren was her important friend. <br /><br />(One day Mizuki accidentally heard what mikasa said about eren.She found it suspicious,so she really want to found out who eren was.)<br />. <br />&quot;How did they know ymir died?&quot; <br />It was obvious when it says &quot;sacrifice&quot; and in that scene they thought ymir hang herself when ymir was actually about to uhm- eAteN<br />. <br />ANYWAYS credits (tiktok):<br />-@josephrule34 (mikasa edit,ladies and gentleman,doja cat) <br />-@shinjifagg (mikasa edit,gentleman) <br />@uwuudino (mikasa ackerman,idk the song) <br />-@shrimpue (mikasa edit,rich boy) <br />-@fe1winter (mikasa edit,maneater) <br />-@erengift (mikasa edit,the one with the cat- idk the song) <br />-@vanitas.ae (mikasa edit,idk the title of the song again) <br />-@kvibes_anime (mikasa eren levi hange edit) <br />-@gracee_314 (mikasa blushing edit,idk prob an indonesian song) <br />-@gaarans (historia reiss edit,idk the song) <br />-@natthakit10110 (historia edit,snowman) <br />-@simp4aotwomen (historia punches levi,idk the song) <br />-@editxloarr (when historia became queen,idk the song) <br />-@fixx_xel (historia edit,idk the song help) <br />-@romantaries (historia edit,idkkkk the song) <br />-@samvanime (Ymirxhistoria edit,idk the song) <br />-@miss.e.l.i.s.a (what is historia sexuality?)<br />-@coasxt (Ymirxhistoria edit,idk the song-) <br />-@dixdieesan (historia edit,uhh idk) <br />-@kunymir307 (Ymirxhistoria edit,i still don't know the song) <br />-@crescent.editz (Annie edit,dunno the song) <br />-@jeansstripper (Annie edit,Alors on Danse)<br />-@emmatales (Annie edit,idk the song 😐) <br />-@annieleonheartswife1 (Annie:I'm a bad b*tch you can't kill me,giorno's theme) <br />-@_lonet_ (Female titan aka Annie edit,snowman) <br />-@saikkiiwi (Annie edit,idk the song) <br /><br />Credits for youtube:<br />-<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/q2i43rqnpE8">https://youtu.be/q2i43rqnpE8</a> <br />-<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Bd9xyLorApM">https://youtu.be/Bd9xyLorApM</a> <br />-<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/QGDrNIs-jPM">https://youtu.be/QGDrNIs-jPM</a> <br />. <br />Ah,Have a good day or night!{% endraw %}
