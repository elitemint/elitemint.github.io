{% raw %}The dock shenanigans continue, and while repudiative, this was the most productive trip of the ENTIRE YEAR... Plus, it's either this or a carp catch and cook, which may or may not be finally happening. Anywhoodles, Booberto and I met a bud Chris down at the dock for some post-darkness kitty cat fishing, and well.. We got em, even with them getting wrapped in junk.
