I've seen comments on another one of my videos about low carb saying something like &quot;Oh sure, you can lose weight on low carb, which is why all the rice eating Japanese people are so thin, right?&quot; <br />So with this video (and maybe the last one), I'm hoping to show that the diet over here is more complex than just &quot;high carb&quot;<br /><br /><br />0:00 - Intro: America &amp; Japan<br />0:42 - People walk more in Japan<br />1:35 - Portion sizes are smaller <br />2:30 - America and Soda<br />2:40 - Rice vs. Wheat<br />3:50 - Fermented foods keeping the gut healthy<br />5:14 - Meat consumption is balanced with Fish consumption<br />5:54 - Muscle meat and organ meat balance<br />7:57 - Green Tea<br />8:43 - School Lunches in Japan<br /><br />A pdf of the transcript with links to my sources can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/17282506">https://www.patreon.com/posts/17282506</a><br /><br />- - - <br /><br />Big thanks to Greg from &quot;Life Where I'm From&quot; for letting me use some shots from his video &quot;Tokyo by Train&quot; ! - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/8EvfNU">https://goo.gl/8EvfNU</a>  (They're the professional shots near the start of people walking in Kamakura / around the train station)<br />-Make sure and check out his channel - it's very interesting, especially if you're interested in Japan: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/s1Xfvt">https://goo.gl/s1Xfvt</a> <br />- - -<br />Featured Music:<br />Broke for Free - Playground Pigeon<br />Broke for Free - IF<br /><br />For Business inquiries: <br />joseph.everett.wil@gmail.com{% endraw %}
