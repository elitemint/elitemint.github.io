{% raw %}Germany registered a record number of COVID-19 cases on Thursday, breaking a record set in December 2020. Disease control agency the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) reported 33,949 new infections in a single day.<br /><br />The news came one day after Health Minister Jens Spahn declared that Germany was living in a &quot;pandemic of the unvaccinated&quot; and that the fourth wave of the virus was &quot;in full force&quot; across the country.<br /><br />What is the situation for hospitals and vaccines?<br /><br />As Germany's vaccination program lags behind other European countries, Spahn also warned that those unwilling to get vaccinated could face new restrictions, such as being barred from shops and restaurants.<br /><br />Recent figures from the RKI show that only 66.5% of Germans are fully vaccinated, compared to 88% in Portugal and 81% in Spain.<br /><br />Hospitals were also beginning to buckle under the pressure as the number of intensive care beds filled up, largely populated by the unvaccinated.<br /><br />On Wednesday night, the rate of hospitalizations per 100,000 residents over 7 days, the German government's new key statistic to measure the severity of the pandemic, rose to 3.62 up from 3.29 just the day before.<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />For more news go to: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.dw.com/en/">http://www.dw.com/en/</a><br />Follow DW on social media:<br />►Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/">https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/</a><br />►Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/dwnews">https://twitter.com/dwnews</a><br />►Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dwnews">https://www.instagram.com/dwnews</a><br />Für Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch">https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch</a><br /><br />#Germany #Coronavirus #Pandemic{% endraw %}
