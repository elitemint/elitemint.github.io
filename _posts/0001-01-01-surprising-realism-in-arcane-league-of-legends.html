{% raw %}I've been watching Netflix's Arcane: League of Legends, and it's amazing! Even better than I was hoping. The writing, visual quality, and voice acting are even better than I expected. The fight scenes are both badass and brutally realistic.<br /><br />It's a convincing, immersive world overall, although of course there are some oddities (possibly mistakes). So let's delve into it and take a look at some of the things that stood out to me. Over-thinking mode engaged. :)<br /><br />*** Time Stamps ***<br /><br />00:00 - 00:58  Intro<br />00:58 - 03:02  Vi's boxing skills<br />03:02 - 03:41  Dodging a knife<br />03:41 - 03:59  Vander's knuckle duster brawling<br />03:59 - 05:34  Vi vs. Sevika with bionic arm<br />05:34 - 07:29  Accurate gun handling &amp; aim<br />07:29 - 08:46  Ingame LoL vs. Arcane Caitlyn<br />08:46 - 09:21  Animation / immersion / Steampunk<br />09:21 - 10:59  Logical flaw: Hextech gauntlets (&amp; partial cyberlimbs)<br />10:59 - 14:11  Confused by Caitlyn's rifle - What is it?<br />14:11 - 14:52  How many cartridges can it hold?<br />14:52 - 15:22  Final comments / outro<br /><br /><br />*** Music ***<br /><br />Intro song:<br />&quot;Illuminate&quot; by Vindsvept<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vindsvept.bandcamp.com/track/illuminate">https://vindsvept.bandcamp.com/track/illuminate</a><br />Used with artist's permission<br /><br />Outtakes:<br />&quot;Little People At Work&quot; by Horrorpen<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://opengameart.org/content/little-people-at-work-loop">https://opengameart.org/content/little-people-at-work-loop</a><br />Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license (CC BY 3.0)<br /><br />Outro:<br />&quot;Highland Storm&quot; by The Slanted Room Records<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://theslantedroom.github.io/steve.yee/">https://theslantedroom.github.io/steve.yee/</a><br />Used with artist's permission<br /><br /><br />*** Support the channel ***<br /><br />Help fund future videos, get bonus content and access to an exclusive Discord server<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/skallagrim">http://www.patreon.com/skallagrim</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.subscribestar.com/skallagrim">https://www.subscribestar.com/skallagrim</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3WIohkLkH4GFoMrrWVZZFA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3WIohkLkH4GFoMrrWVZZFA/join</a><br /><br />Books about history and/or martial arts, swords, knives, video/audio equipment, and other stuff I recommend (as an Amazon Affiliate I earn commission through these links):<br />US - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/skallagrimnilsson">https://www.amazon.com/shop/skallagrimnilsson</a><br />Canada - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2HeOCMA">https://amzn.to/2HeOCMA</a><br /><br />Other ways to support the channel by shopping through affiliate links:<br /><br />Kult of Athena, my favorite online store for reproductions of historical arms and armor, fantasy swords, etc:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kultofathena.com/?koa=259">https://www.kultofathena.com/?koa=259</a><br /><br />Where to get HEMA gear and practice swords:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.woodenswords.com/?Click=1799">http://www.woodenswords.com/?Click=1799</a><br /><br />*** Social media &amp; merch ***<br /><br />How to contact me (can't always reply, as I get too many messages):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Skallagrim/about">https://www.youtube.com/c/Skallagrim/about</a><br /><br />See a list of my video uploads:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/_Skallagrim_">https://twitter.com/_Skallagrim_</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/SkallagrimYT">https://www.facebook.com/SkallagrimYT</a><br /><br />Channel-related shirts and other merch:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://skallagrim.spreadshirt.com/">http://skallagrim.spreadshirt.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/skallagrim">https://teespring.com/stores/skallagrim</a><br /><br />#skallagrim #arcane #leagueoflegends{% endraw %}
