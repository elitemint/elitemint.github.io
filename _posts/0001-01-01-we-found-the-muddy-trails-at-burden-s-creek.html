{% raw %}Part 2 of the Burden's Creek Ride! We found some NASTY mud that the 420 could NOT get through but we still sent it! We also found some water trails that looked just like Canal Road! Speaking of Canal, I need to make another trip back out there! Where should I go next? I've been thinking of Elton Swamp; if you've been would you recommend? Leave it down in the comments below!<br /><br />I ordered the new 520 top end kit! Unfortunately, it has no ETA which means the 420 will be down for a minute! But, once it comes in, I'll be making a install video on it and give my review on the power, reliability, etc. Keep a lookout on my Instagram, I post the most recent news on there! STAY TUNED!<br /><br />***GIVEAWAY*** ***GIVEAWAY*** ***GIVEAWAY*** <br /><br />I've partnered up with @full.send.mud.straps on Instagram and we're giving away 5 MUD STRAPS!
