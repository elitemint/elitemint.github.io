It's a crazy story that even Hollywood couldn't conceive of. After my studies, I started working in the knife industry, writing books, working intensively with special forces worldwide and developing knives for them. Thirty-five years later, I got the chance to develop the knives for the last part of the Rambo series, which closed a circle for me personally.<br /> <br />I have been seriously collecting film knives since 1985. From 1987 also the originals from the USA. What I have always regretted as a serious collector was the fact that there were either only the very expensive and limited handcrafted knives of the knifemakers like Jimmy Lile, Gil Hibben and Jack Crain or the cheap replicas, which are only suitable as wall hangers. Neither the steel nor the quality of the workmanship are very good, because with these replicas one preferred to appeal to the film souvenir collector. The real knife enthusiast or even the right knife user couldn't do anything with these cheap replicas. My intention was to change something here from the beginning.<br /><br />We have developed our knives in three categories: the handmade version for the super demanding collector. All made by hand and limited to only 100 pieces. Then the High End collector series in cooperation with my partner Lionsteel. Here we only use really best materials. Galco as the original manufacturer of the Rambo 2 sheaths also came on board. Limited to 300 pieces each. And then the CNC² variant as a knife for real use. This series is primarily aimed at the real user, who wants to use his knife and want to have a reliable but also affordable knife. The custom version of the MK9 costs 2,375,- EURO, the CNC-Tec from Lionsteel 925,- EUR and the CNC² 359,- EUR. You can already see the difference. There are also no film or advertising prints on our knives as in the film souvenir replicas. No real operator would go into combat with such a knife! Our knives are primarily tactical knives that can be seen in a film. That's how I like to see the whole project. We don't do fictitious, unrealistic knives with glossy polish or the like!{% endraw %}
