{% raw %}Poor actors go through so much to bring us our favourite movies. From not being able to pee while in costume, to not being able to eat due to restricting corsets to straight up passing out while filming from lack of good breath support. We’re wondering just what lengths they will go to to get the shot. One of the biggest things they seem to complain about is the heat! When your latex suit is hugging you in all the wrong places, you can kind of get the image. And speaking of latex, Ruby Rose dropped the role of Bat Girl because of it! Her hives were only getting worse every time she put it on. Sometimes, you have to take the mask off to protect your own safety. And sometimes, you need your stunt double to step in and take over entirely, because of a horrible glue allergy. Which is how it was for Emma Watson in Harry Potter. Contact lenses can be sunglasses. We didn’t know that. And they can also be paper cut magnets. Beards can burn you. At least, the one that set on fire in Pirates of the Caribbean could. Thongs are painful at the best of times, we imagine even more so underneath that spidey suit. Christian Bale gave Robert Pattinson the best advice as he passed the batman torch down. And that’s, make sure your costume is capable of letting you take a wiz. What a wise man. And so many actors had to be fit with costume-cooling systems, like Skarsgard in Dune and Dan Stevens in Beauty and the Beast. Oh, and let’s not forget the double who’s prosthetic filled up with blood after nicking his eyebrow with an axe. That’s a big yikes.<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Things">http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Things</a><br /><br />Chapters:<br />00:00 Intro<br />00:16 Meowch<br />00:49 Axe-ual Danger<br />01:26 Oil Bath<br />01:56 A Real Pain in the Neck<br />02:22 Run with Scissors<br />02:45 Sweatiest Prince<br />03:17 Seeing Stars<br />03:49 Hives<br />04:18 Stuck Like That<br />04:46 Never Let Go, Rose<br />05:12 Boiling Zombies<br />05:48 Inevitable Headache<br />06:21 Wearing Ladies Underwear<br />06:43 Watered-Down Harley<br />07:07 Stuffed Up<br />07:34 Papercuts<br />08:04 Breathless<br />08:50 Complainer<br />09:13 Flaming Beard<br />09:32 Airhead<br />01:14 Outro<br /><br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheThingscom/">https://www.facebook.com/TheThingscom/</a><br /><br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thethings.com">https://www.thethings.com</a><br /><br />Written by: Kydra Ryan<br />Narrated by: Kydra Ryan<br />Edited by: Maite Cambra<br /><br /><br />For copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com{% endraw %}
