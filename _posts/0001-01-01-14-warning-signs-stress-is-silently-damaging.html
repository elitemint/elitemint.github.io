Just like sore muscles, stress can cause you to clench your jaw or grind your teeth. If you are experiencing jaw pain or frequent headaches, you could be clenching your jaw without noticing. Take a moment to relax all of the muscles in your face. <br /><br />Back Pain: When we are stressed, we tend to tense more than usual. A constant flex of certain muscle groups can cause sore muscles. Why do we tense up when we are stressed out? This seems to be the bodyâ€™s natural response as if to protect you from an oncoming injury. The problem is, if you never relax, those muscles stay tense and at the end of the day you could be feeling exhausted and sore.<br /><br />Second Guessing Yourself: Stress affects how we think and process information, including how we make decisions. No matter how you make decisions, be it more intuitive, analytical, or somewhere in the middle, that is your tried-and-true decision-making style. If it works for you, you usually stick by it. However, if you feel yourself questioning how you make decisions, continuously switching up your style, or avoiding decisions, you could be stressed out. <br /><br />Numbness or Tingling in Your Arms and Hands: You may be holding all that tension you're feeling in your neck and shoulders, which is a very common problem. With major stress, the tension can lead to compression of a particular bundle of nerves that goes into your arm. This can cause numbness and tingling. <br /><br />For more information, please watch the video until the very end.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Subscribe to Bestie : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/tUqro6">https://goo.gl/tUqro6</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/">https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bestiehealth/">https://www.instagram.com/bestiehealth/</a>{% endraw %}
