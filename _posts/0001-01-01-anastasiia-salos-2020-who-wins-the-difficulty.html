{% raw %}Anastasiia Salos - Who wins the Difficulty?<br />This is me trying to figure out how much a routine could worth if it was executed perfectly.<br /><br />Some precisions/corrections<br />1:20 this are 2 rotation not 3<br />1:50 Could be transmission without hands / passing through (without visual control) (0.3)<br />2:43 small throw-catch (without hands / on the floor) (0.2)<br />3:35 Really could be a on a good day catch outside visual control + in rotation (+0.2)<br /><br />***<br />✨ Instagram: clematisrg5<br />❤️ My Patreon <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/clematisRG">https://www.patreon.com/clematisRG</a><br />I usually don't earn anything from Youtube, the advertisements you see are usually only because sometimes I have to use copyright gymnast's musics or FIG contents. <br /><br />#AnastasiiaSalos #Tokyo2020 #Difficulty #Rhythmicgymnastics{% endraw %}
