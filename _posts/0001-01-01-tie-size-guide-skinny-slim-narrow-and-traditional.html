This is great for guys who are very slender and like to wear clothing that is very fitted. Due to its small width, it’s also recommended to use a smaller knot, such as a a four in hand knot, and be worn more casually.<br /><br />If you are a thicker gent then it’s best to stay away from these neckties due to the disproportion it would give to the wearer. <br /><br />Next up, the Slim tie<br /><br />This tie is only half inch bigger than the skinny tie and has become popular amongst younger professionals. This tie is slightly a step up from the skinny tie because it works well for both formal and casual events. (2.5)<br /><br />It’s a great option for teens or men of short stature who cannot fill out a traditional tie. <br /><br />Next is the Narrow width tie, which is a great in-between size that won’t look too skinny or too wide. it’s a modern width that works well for both big or small men. (3-in)<br /><br />Last but not least is the traditional tie that measures up to 3.25- 3.5 inches. This is a very standard size in the market and it’s a width that works for all occasions. <br /><br />If for some reason you unsure of the width of your tie, then you can always measure it with a tape ruler or us a measuring app whenever you’re out shopping for one. <br />I know this may be confusing or too much to take in so here is a size range guide according to your body type.<br /><br />if your a very slim/slender man, it recommended you go for something falls in line from 2.25 to 2.75 inches in width. <br /><br />If you are an average or athletic build then you have a bit more to play with starting from 2.25 to 3.25 inches in width. <br /><br />if you are a much broader and larger man then it is recommended you go for 2.75 in to 3.5 inches. <br /><br />also don’t forget to match the tie width to your lapel if you decided to throw on a suit jacket.{% endraw %}
