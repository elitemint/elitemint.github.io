{% raw %}Marryanne Gray is living with the shame and guilt of accidentally killing someone. It happened in 1977 near Oxford, Ohio, when she was 22 years old. She was driving her dadâ€™s car down a two-lane county road, going the speed limit of 45 miles per hour. All of a sudden, she says she saw a pale flash and felt a bump. She had hit and killed an 8-year-old boy named Brian, who ran out into the street while getting the mail. She says after 44 years, she still struggles to find joy in her life.{% endraw %}
