I was interested in the complete elimination of fear from the mind, and here’s where I’ve arrived.<br /><br />Fear is a barrier that prevents the mind from learning, and the source of fear is our desire to protect ourselves from pain. But we can’t protect ourselves from pain. Our protection lies in the hands of Fate. Fate trades by a contract, and it’s possible to learn this contract and lessen the amount of pain we receive in life. But to completely eliminate fear from the mind, two things have to be true: when Fate does give us pain, it’s necessary and bearable. And only when fear vanishes are we able to be free, uncontrolled by anyone. But as long as fear exists in the mind, there’s always a tyrant trying to control us.<br /><br />RELATED VIDEOS<br />_<br />Practical Philosophy Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5faAYlGYYoF7rgKH4oo_B81n4wE1n2xP">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5faAYlGYYoF7rgKH4oo_B81n4wE1n2xP</a><br /><br />GET MORE FREE CONTENT<br />—<br />Get Daily Thoughts on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/freedomintht">http://twitter.com/freedomintht</a><br />Get Daily Insights on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/freedomintht">http://instagram.com/freedomintht</a><br />Get Exclusive Essays in my Newsletter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://freedominthought.com/exclusives">http://freedominthought.com/exclusives</a><br /><br />FURTHER READING<br />—<br />The Dhammapada by Buddha: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/xQQG">https://geni.us/xQQG</a><br /><br />NOTES<br />—<br />(1) Videos are just my opinion, for entertainment and informational purposes.
