{% raw %}2-This video shows my Nanna demonstrating how to ward off the evil eye - a Calabrian folk healing ritual. A step-by-step procedure is below. Please note that there are many variations of this practice. Blog Post here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nipotidiagata.wordpress.com/2018/01/15/how-to-ward-off-il-malocchio-the-evil-eye-calabrese-style/">https://nipotidiagata.wordpress.com/2018/01/15/how-to-ward-off-il-malocchio-the-evil-eye-calabrese-style/</a><br /><br />The following is my family’s method of protection, or ritual to thwart the evil eye (and determine if you are fascina, or bound by malocchio). Following this, there is also a video showing my Nanna demonstrating this Calabrian folk healing ritual.<br /><br />Materials:<br /><br />Glass, Water (3/4 full), Tablespoon, Oil (any oil will do; my Nanna uses vegetable oil)<br /><br />Steps:<br /><br />1- Fill a glass 3/4 full with water, and place on flat surface.<br />2- Pour vegetable oil on tablespoon.<br />3- While thinking of the person who is ill, dip your thumb into the oil and drop 4 drops in a cross formation (sign of the cross).<br />4- If the person is fascina, the oil droplets will either “clump” together as one oil puddle on the water’s surface, or make a “horn” shape.<br />5- If the person is not fascina, the oil droplets will simply fall into the water in separate drops.<br />6- Repeat until all oil is used.<br />7- If “commissioned” to perform the ritual, the person would be informed if they are or are not. If they are, they are supposed to feel better after the ritual is complete.{% endraw %}
