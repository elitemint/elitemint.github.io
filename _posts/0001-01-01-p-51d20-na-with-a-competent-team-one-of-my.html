{% raw %}One of my absolute favourites, the D-models, P-51s. A joy to fly, fast, great dive characteristics and decent fire power.<br />I just do not fly them enough - because competent teams is a rarity..<br /><br /><br />Here they DO keep their discipline however. Making sure to get altitude, speed and donÂ´t get involved in silly turn fights..{% endraw %}
