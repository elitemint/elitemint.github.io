{% raw %}If you are planning to temporarily disable your Instagram account then this video is for you. In less than 2 minutes you can disable your Instagram account for a short period of time; no data will be lost if you temporarily disable your insta.<br /><br />To deactivate your account, you can either use your computer or a mobile browser. You will not be able to disable the Instagram account using the app itself (though you can visit instagram.com from the app within and disable it which is clearly explained in the video).<br /><br />After deactivating your account, you will be logged out of the Instagram application. To reactivate your account simply sign in and your account with data will be back.<br /><br />Hope this video is helpful.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://heyletslearnsomething.com/blog/deactivate-instagram-account-temporarily">https://heyletslearnsomething.com/blog/deactivate-instagram-account-temporarily</a><br />-----------------------------<br />Learn more about WordPress useful codes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://skl.sh/2GgiOKn">https://skl.sh/2GgiOKn</a><br /><br />-----------------------------<br />We got A scores on GTmetrix and 90+ on Google PageSpeed Insights for heyletslearnsomething.com!<br /><br />These are affiliate links, BUT WE USE THEM on our site; We do not promote anything we don't use!  <br /><br />WP Rocket:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shrsl.com/3348v">https://shrsl.com/3348v</a><br /><br />Hosting:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shrsl.com/33491">https://shrsl.com/33491</a><br /><br />WordPress themes - We use &quot;Enfold&quot;<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://1.envato.market/c/2653046/528319/4415">https://1.envato.market/c/2653046/528319/4415</a>{% endraw %}
