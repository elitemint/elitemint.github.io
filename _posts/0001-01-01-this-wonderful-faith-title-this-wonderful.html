{% raw %}Title:  This Wonderful Faith<br /><br />Artist: LSM<br /><br />Album: Faith &amp; Love <br /><br /><br /><br />Titus 3:15 ( Footnote 1 - 4th Paragraph )<br /><br /><br /><br />This wonderful faith and this super-excellent love are out of the Triune God, who earnestly desires to be joined to us to be our everything. This Triune God passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection from the dead, and ascension to the heavens on high and was ultimately consummated as the life-giving Spirit ( 1 Cor. 15:45 ). This Spirit of life ( Rom. 8:2 ), who includes divinity, humanity, and Christ's crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension and is the reality of the all-inclusive Christ ( John 14:16-20 ), dwells in our regenerated spirit ( Rom. 8:16, 2 Tim. 4:22 ).{% endraw %}
