{% raw %}TacticalDoodle and I hit the TNP Bunker for another Tactical Philosophy video! This time we share our thoughts and experiences on the 5.45x39mm caliber. It's not widely used by most guys and the AR15 still dominates the scene. But in the AK74-ish platform which we concentrate on here, it has some advantages and holds interest when other ammo might be unavailable. It's a key reason some are considering adding the platform.<br />We'll cover the ballistics, discuss Russian military ammunition, show you the penetration of 7N6 and commercial loads, discuss accuracy of the stamped receiver AK, highlight the SAWC of the usual AK platform, delight in its shootability and more. Though it's not a play by play against the ubiquitous 5.56x45mm, some comparisons will have to be made. Lots of TNP in-field shooting drills and testing is shown, all of which focused are opinions. As predicted in this video, the commies have cut off Russian importation of these calibers so supply has been affected. But you may still have or score the rec'd quantity in the future of this proven Russian war caliber.<br /><br />Another feature length Tactical POU video only made possible by TNP Donors:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Nutnfancy">https://www.patreon.com/Nutnfancy</a><br />You can now donate to TNP via PayPal if you'd prefer that method, humble gratitude from us for that support too: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/y5zzf9tq">https://tinyurl.com/y5zzf9tq</a><br /><br />Magpul AK Zukhov furniture we love: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shrsl.com/3bd6z">https://shrsl.com/3bd6z</a><br />Corvette Model in Background:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3z2dv8w">https://amzn.to/3z2dv8w</a>{% endraw %}
