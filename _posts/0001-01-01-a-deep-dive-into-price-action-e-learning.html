In this E-learning session I take a deep dive into price action and explain the details that are rarely talked about in candlestick or chart reading courses.  As technicians traders are often distracted by the next shinny indicator or combination thereof and lose focus on the what really matters, Price Action!  <br /><br />We only get paid when price moves.  Indicators pay nothing but isn't interesting we spend the most of our time studying everything but price.  I hope in this video I demist rate the importance of becoming a student of price and how that study can greatly improve your trading results.  Price is always trying to give us clues of future price action if were willing to go the extra mile and can read what it's saying.  I hope this deep dive into price action help you imporve your charting skills and helps you reach your trading goals.<br /> <br />‚úÖTry Right Way Options for 30 days - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/RWO60daytrial">http://bit.ly/RWO60daytrial</a><br /><br />‚úÖOne of my favorite and most profitable trading patterns I call, ‚ÄúPop-Out-Of-The-Box.‚Äù  You can get the full Pop-Out-Of-The-Box workshop course here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/3sDI6Wr">http://bit.ly/3sDI6Wr</a><br /><br />‚úÖThere is no easier way to make money in the market than finding a trending stock and just waiting for the next entry.
