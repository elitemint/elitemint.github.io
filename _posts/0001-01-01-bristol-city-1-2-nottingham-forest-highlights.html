{% raw %}Highlights from Ashton Gate as two injury-time goals from Nottingham Forest substitute Lyle Taylor denied City what promised to be their first home win of the season.<br /><br />Alex Scott scored his first club goal to put the Robins ahead at half-time but Taylor dispatched from the penalty spot just as four minutes of added time were announced.<br /><br />The points looked to be shared but there was still time for the visitors to throw themselves forward again, and Taylor found himself in the right place at the right time as he put the ball over the line at the far post.<br /><br />It was the cruellest of endings in a match where City had been largely positive and looked to have bounced back from disappointment just days earlier, however sport can be nasty and so it proved at a rain-soaked Ashton Gate where the wait for a first home win of the season continues.<br /><br />Follow Bristol City on Social Media!<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/bristolcity">https://twitter.com/bristolcity</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bristolcityfc">https://www.facebook.com/bristolcityfc</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bristolcityfc">https://www.instagram.com/bristolcityfc</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/bristolcityfc">https://www.tiktok.com/bristolcityfc</a><br /><br />For more, head to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bcfc.co.uk">https://www.bcfc.co.uk</a>{% endraw %}
