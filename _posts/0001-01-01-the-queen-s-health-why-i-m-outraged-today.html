{% raw %}ðŸ’  Today on the River Show we have a chainwag about Her Majesty's health followed by a cosy Tip Jar Corner which begins at 24:00<br /><br />ðŸ’– My Tip Jar for those who have kindly asked: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/theriverbank">https://www.paypal.me/theriverbank</a> (Follow the link and select the 'Send' option)<br /><br />ðŸ’  DISCLAIMER: The River Show is presented as lighthearted entertainment with genuine opinion pieces blended with a dash of comedy, parody and a sprinkling of theatre. Commentary is offered in the style of conjecture and gossip, with the viewer encouraged to take all views and opinions expressed with a pinch of salt and use their own discretion.  I'm not a royal expert, and am not here to educate you. I'm here to shoot the breeze, have a giggle and sip the tea. I hope you enjoy the show.<br /><br />ðŸ’  I respectfully ask that all remarks, questions and messages are kept to the comment section under the video.  I don't use Instagram or Twitter and I don't accept gifts, emails or post.  Thank you for your understanding.<br /><br />ðŸ’  Business enquiries only: <br />Write to Madeleine at amanagement898@gmail.com with 'River' in the subject box.{% endraw %}
