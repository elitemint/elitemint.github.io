{% raw %}The Drop of Perfume makes anyone within Victor's shriek radius Oblivious, meaning that they cannot hear the Killer's terror radius. Even if you increase the radius with Madeleine's Glove (+4m), this effect is quite trivial in most situations and is largely overshadowed by the much stronger Silencing Cloth add-on, which straight up makes Charlotte undetectable. That being said, if you send yourself to a good map and place Victor strategically... you can still get some interesting results. ðŸ˜„<br /><br />Watch live: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/Otzdarva">https://www.twitch.tv/Otzdarva</a><br />Join our community: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://discord.gg/Otzdarva">http://discord.gg/Otzdarva</a><br /><br />Thumbnail 3D render by the lovely Ev3ntic:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/Ev3ntic">https://www.twitch.tv/Ev3ntic</a>{% endraw %}
