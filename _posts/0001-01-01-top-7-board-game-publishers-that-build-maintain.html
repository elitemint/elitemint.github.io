And I think that's incredible. Whether it's engaging, response times, regular live streams, general customer service or whatever....I really appreciate the companies that go the extra mile. <br /><br />TimeStamps:<br />0:00:00 - Introduction<br />0:02:15 - Awaken Realms<br />0:04:07 - Lucky Duck Games<br />0:06:19 - Chip Theory Games<br />0:08:40 - Orange Nebula<br />0:10:08 - IV Games<br />0:12:20 - Stonemaier Games<br />0:15:49 - Mythic Games<br />0:16:50 - Closing Up<br /><br />The Weekly Quack Podcast - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://theweeklyquack.com/">http://theweeklyquack.com/</a><br /><br />For great prices on new and used board games, check us out at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://boardgameco.com/">https://boardgameco.com/</a> If you have an active BoardGameGeek collection set up, trade with us here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://boardgametraders.com/#/">https://boardgametraders.com/#/</a><br /><br />For media inquiries, please email alex@boardgameco.com{% endraw %}
