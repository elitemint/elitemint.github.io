{% raw %}Real Club Valderrama showed it's teeth as Pablo Larrazábal battled to an opening level par round of 71.<br /><br />► SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://et.golf/Subscribe">http://et.golf/Subscribe</a> <br /><br /><br /><br />The Race to Dubai makes its way to Real Club Valderrama for the 2021 Estrella Damm N.A. Andalucía Masters. World number one Jon Rahm will be hoping to improve on his T17th finish in Madrid last week. Valderrama is where his father watched the 1997 Ryder Cup and was inspired to take up the game and introduce it to Jon. Bernd Wiesberger has three top-20s in his last four starts, including a T12 last week and a runner-up finish in the Omega European Masters. He double bogeyed the last in Switzerland, but Crans-sur-Sierre is a similarly strategic layout to Valderrama. 48-year-old Richard Bland is in the form of his life and is now up to 78 in the world rankings courtesy of a win and seven top-10s in his last 15 events. He backed up a T4 at the Dunhill Links with a T9 in Madrid last week. Other names to look out for include Thomas Pieters, Andrew Johnston and Mattias Schwab.<br /><br /><br /><br />► WEBSITE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.europeantour.com">http://www.europeantour.com</a><br /><br />► FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheEuropeanTour">https://www.facebook.com/TheEuropeanTour</a> <br /><br />► TWITTER <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/EuropeanTour">https://twitter.com/EuropeanTour</a> <br /><br />► INSTAGRAM <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/europeantour">https://instagram.com/europeantour</a>{% endraw %}
