{% raw %}Hi :) this is a more detailed version of my previous video where I talked about how I make digital handwritten notes using OneNote. The tablet I use in the video: <br />Wacom One graphics tablet (small)*: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/38umgwA">https://amzn.to/38umgwA</a><br />The adapter I use*: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/35tARqa">https://amzn.to/35tARqa</a><br /><br />* As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.

All opinions about the tablet are my own.<br /><br />A pen tablet is a cheaper alternative to buying a new iPad or any touch screen device - it still enables you to make digital notes. Its lightweight and easy to carry and I wish I started using my pen tablet for making notes sooner. <br /><br />It can be tricky to get used to using a pen tablet to make written notes on your laptop, but in this video I share different tips on how to make this process easier. <br /><br />Prior to using the Wacom One tablet, I used the Wacom Intuos small pen tablet for about 6 years. The tablet still works fine but I decided to switch because I was having issues with my cable and the tablet itself was getting a bit worn out (due to neglect on my part to be fair). I initially purchased this to create digital art but ended up using this a lot during A levels to do past papers on my laptop.<br /><br />Fast forward to now, I use my graphics tablet regularly to make handwritten digital notes - it wasn't always like this though. I started off making typed notes at the start of my degree but I didn't really enjoy doing that. So I spent a lot of time handwriting my notes. However, as the years went by I found that  I was just stacking up a lot of paper notes that were difficult to navigate. For example if I wanted to search my notes for Marfans syndrome, it would take me ages to find out bits I had written about it from all of my years of studying. For a while I contemplated buying an iPad Pro and apple pencil to make my notes since I really enjoy making digital art too. But it was just waaaay too expensive for me to justify buying at this point in my life as a student, so I carried on making traditional handwritten notes.<br />Then I rediscovered my Wacom Tablet and started making digital notes. Now everything is so much easier to find, I can write as much as I want and I don't have to worry about carrying all of my notes to the library to revise a certain module. Everything is on my laptop. Even better - I can access everything on any device as long as they are connected to the internet. If you're a medical student or any type of student, you will probably find this to be a useful alternative to buying an iPad. You can connect a wacom tablet to whatever device/laptop you're working with - you don't need anything fancy.<br /><br /><br />APPS I USE: <br />1. OneNote (FREE) - very easy to use, you can write typed/handwritten notes. You can add tags to info, search up things easily and add pdf's. You can structure your notes really well. You can share your notes with others. You can access your notes online on any device. And it's FREE. <br />2. Notability - you can edit pdf documents very easily. If you're an A-level or GCSE student you might find this app useful to do lots of past papers. You can organise your past papers into folders and write your answers of this pdf. You can then export them as PDF again to share with others. It costs £1.99 I believe, which for me isn't too bad considering I have used it a lot. <br />3. Microsoft PowerPoint/Word - you can use pen tools on these applications. Just click on the draw tab.<br />4. Autodesk (FREE) - the app I use for drawing but also for making the animations/handwriting for these videos. It's a really good free app for digital art and drawing. You have plenty of brush/pen options and can control the settings on them to customise the tool. If you like drawing, you might enjoy doodling on there and copying/pasting your drawings onto one note.<br /><br /><br />I use a USB-C to USB 3.0 adapter to connect my wacom tablet to my laptop.<br />Time stamps: <br />0:27 - OneNote basics<br />0:53 - Paper style<br />1:20 - Draw tab <br />2:23 - Writing with the tablet <br />2:55 - Buttons on the pen<br />4:35 - Shapes for structure<br />4:53 - Images and shortcuts<br />6:00 - Tags and searching<br />7:41 - Lecture notes<br />8:34 - Summary<br /><br /><br /><br />Music: <br />Music by Goosetaf - Cherry Blossom - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thmatc.co/?l=58A0DC3C">https://thmatc.co/?l=58A0DC3C</a><br />Music by Goosetaf - Fresh Air - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thmatc.co/?l=4764E107">https://thmatc.co/?l=4764E107</a><br />Music by Goosetaf - Efflorescence - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thmatc.co/?l=55111C68">https://thmatc.co/?l=55111C68</a><br />Music by Goosetaf - Bumblebee - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thmatc.co/?l=82BEC6A2">https://thmatc.co/?l=82BEC6A2</a><br />Music by Rögg Collins - Up All Night - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thmatc.co/?l=34075D88">https://thmatc.co/?l=34075D88</a><br /><br />Thank you for watching :)<br /><br />As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.
