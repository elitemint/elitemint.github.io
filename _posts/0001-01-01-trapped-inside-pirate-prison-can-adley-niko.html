{% raw %}it’s a Dad and Kids day with some Mom and Baby updates!!<br /><br />JOIN OUR FAM!! --- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/rfgp8V">http://goo.gl/rfgp8V</a><br /><br />Best Pirate Day Ever 1147<br /><br />I know I've said this many times before, but I love having breakfast with my kiddos. Espcially when we're all three having cereal and laughing and starting our day and morning routine off right. Today, Adley gives you the run down of what we're doing. Since Jenny is off being a good mama to Navey, Adley, Niko Bear, and I are going to the lake to play on the new playground set we have on pirate island. But we have to face time Jenny and see the new baby first. Oh, she is sooo cute!!<br /><br />We get to the lake and the kids run as fast as they can to the beach. They love our new pirate ship and even though we played on it for hours yesterday, they can't wait to play pretend some more today. We do have to clean up and mop a little, because some sand has got inside the pirate ship. While we're setting things up, we discover that Adley's new toy make up set has lights, music, and sound effects. It's so cool and she is so happy. We give you guys a quick tour of the new pirate ship, with all its cool animals, unicorns from unicorn island, and our new swing set. it's like having a super fun backyard or a park we can go to any time. Adley and Niko do get caught by pirates and trapped in jail, but luckily I was able to find the keys to free them.<br /><br />We can't spend the day at the beach without swimming. We first make the kiddos little babies out of water balloons, then they jump in, watching the baby do tricks and float in the water. Who knew water balloons could be used as great toys and not just for battles. <br /><br />We head home to see Jenny, who has some amazing baby updates and we end the vlog playing with marbles in the ultimate toy room!!<br /><br /><br />\\\\<br />Watch Adley's last video: 2 PiNK FLAMiNGO PETS!!
