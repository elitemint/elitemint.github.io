{% raw %}As coronavirus infections continue to rapidly spread, hospitals around the word are in dire need of mechanical ventilators, which are currently critically under supplied. We developed a solution to deliver oxygen and create high positive pressure without the use of a ventilator by designing a 3D-printed connector that holds together standard medical equipment. It is called the Materialise Passive NIP, with NIP standing for non-invasive PEEP, and is currently being fast tracked through the regulatory process to make it available as soon as possible during this crisis.<br /><br />Read more: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://mtls.me/2vwh">http://mtls.me/2vwh</a><br /><br />Disclaimer: The Materialise NIP Connector is not commercially available in the United States.{% endraw %}
