As of Wednesday's close, the index was up by 1.8% for November to date, and hovered less than 0.7% below its all-time intraday high. <br /><br />Nvidia (NVDA) shares jumped to help lead both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq higher after the semiconductor company posted record quarterly revenues and strong full-year guidance.

Target (TGT) executives flagged rising labor and other input costs during their earnings call on Wednesday and added to a chorus of other company mentions of inflation. <br /><br />The possibility that elevated inflation will stick around longer than previously anticipated remained a central focus for investors, both for its potential dampening effect on consumer spending, and as a potential catalyst for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than previously telegraphed. The U.S. central bank has so far maintained its accommodative tilt and telegraphed that an initial interest rate hike could take place sometime next year, depending on the evolution of the economic recovery. Investors also continue to await a formal announcement from President Joe Biden about his nominee for Fed chair, with the most likely candidates being current Fed Chair Jerome Powell, and current Fed Governor Lael Brainard.<br /><br />For more on this article, please visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-news-live-updates-november-18-2021-231831751.html">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-news-live-updates-november-18-2021-231831751.html</a>{% endraw %}
