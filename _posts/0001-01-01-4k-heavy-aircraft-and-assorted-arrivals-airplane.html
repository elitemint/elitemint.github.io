{% raw %}Wishing you a Happy New Year 2020 and a Happy New Decade! It's been a while since my last post but I finally snagged some spare time to run up to my hometown Chicago O'Hare <br />to catch some of the latest action. In this video I finally get a decent video of the Austrian Airlines 60th Anniversary Livery and some clips of aircraft in the new United livery as well. <br />Sad to see the KLM 747 finish service to O'Hare after many years of proud service but we welcome the Boeing 787 Dreamliner in all of its increasingly common varieties. <br /><br />It is shaping up to be a promising new year with some new arrivals planned for this year later on including El Al coming back March 22nd and Qantas starting their inaugural to Brisbane on April 15th I will try to get both of these two the day of their first arrival, but if not, rest assured I will try to get several good videos of them in the days that follow. <br /><br />Thanks for your patience putting up with my busy schedule... I do try to post new video as often as I can and I realize that's not been very often lately. <br /><br />A B!G THANX to ALL 60,000+ subscribers!!! <br />I'd still make videos even if nobody watched but you all make it all the more worthwhile. <br /><br />Filmed 1/17/2020 <br />Rather dark and overcast due to an approaching snowstorm at the time of this filming. <br />All Landings are on Runway 10C <br />***************************************************************************<br />See the pinned comment for aircraft identification and flight information. <br />***************************************************************************<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />Follow me on Twitter at <br /><br />twitter.com/ohareaviation<br /><br />-------------------------------<br /><br />Follow me on Instagram at <br /><br />instagram.com/ohareaviation<br /><br />-------------------------------<br /><br />This video is the property of O'HareAviation Plane Spotting &amp; Flight Tracking. <br /><br />It may not be used in any way without permission.<br /><br /><br /><br />Planespotting Chicago O'Hare International Airport KORD / ORD 2020<br /><br />© O'HareAviation 2020<br /><br /><br /><br />#planespotting    #bigplanes     #watchingairplanes{% endraw %}
