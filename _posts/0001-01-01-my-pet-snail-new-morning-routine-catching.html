Are you ready for another Hawaii adventure?! In Hawaii I saw a lot of bugs, snails, lizards, and birds and I had so much fun getting close to them and seeing them up close!! Since animals were everywhere I wanted to show you guys some of the beautiful and weird wildlife by our vacation spot!! One morning when Mom was asleep Dad and I went outside to catch some bugs and we found some snails!! We wanted to make a house for them so we set up a table, bed, chairs, and living room for them!! We even got them some food, water, and some new friends!! We Tried to catch a lizard but they are too fast!! A couple days before we caught one though with my friend Dorothy Gee from the Bucket List Family!! It was so fun playing with these animals!!<br /><br />my last video - ADLEY PRINCESS ARIEL MAKEOVER!! the little mermaid in real life with Dorothy Gee<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ixAEucGcl4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ixAEucGcl4</a><br /><br />my dad's last video - BLACK BEACH SAND CASTLE!!
