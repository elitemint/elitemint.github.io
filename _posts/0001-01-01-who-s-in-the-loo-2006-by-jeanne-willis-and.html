{% raw %}PICTURE BOOKS OUR KIDS LOVED (READ BY OUR KIDS)<br /><br />Welcome to London's largest dedicated children's books event, the Barnes Children's Literature Festival <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.barneskidslitfest.org.">http://www.barneskidslitfest.org.</a><br /><br />Barnes is organised by families for families who love books like we do. One of our absolutely favourite things to do is sharing the books that we loved with our kids and now they're reading them to us. We've put together a few of their greatest hits here because we reckon you'll love them too! <br /><br />Cheers, Barnes XO   <br /><br />'Who's in the loo? There's a very long queue. Is it an elephant having a poo?' There's a queue for the loo at the zoo! Who can be taking so long?<br /><br />Who's in the Loo (2006)<br />Author: Jeanne Willis<br />Illustrator: Adrian Reynolds<br />Publisher: Golden Books, an imprint of Penguin Random House<br /><br />Music: www.zapsplat.com{% endraw %}
