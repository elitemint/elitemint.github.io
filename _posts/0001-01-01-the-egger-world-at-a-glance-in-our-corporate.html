{% raw %}On the occasion of our 60th company anniversary, we ask ourselves the question: &quot;What connects Roman from Poland with Lance from the U.S. or Aude from France?&quot; Our answer: &quot;The passion for our unique material wood&quot; in a new corporate video. Our new video focuses on the perspectives of our employees, like Roman or Aude. In addition to the owners and Group Management, employees introduce the company and describe what makes EGGER special for them - from the first plant manager of the St. Johann plant Manfred Dittrich to mechanical engineering apprentice Alexander Dorfer. They talk about the multi-faceted history of our Group, past and current milestones and venture a glance into the future.{% endraw %}
