{% raw %}I go over an article I wrote<br /><br />telegram link (can also be viewed on web browser):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://telegra.ph/Meta-Materials--Torchlight-An-Interpretation-of-a-Short-Squeeze-Through-a-Unique-RTO-11-24">https://telegra.ph/Meta-Materials--Torchlight-An-Interpretation-of-a-Short-Squeeze-Through-a-Unique-RTO-11-24</a><br />Reddit link<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChunkyDD/comments/r17wgw/meta_materials_torchlight_an_interpretation_of_a/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">https://www.reddit.com/r/ChunkyDD/comments/r17wgw/meta_materials_torchlight_an_interpretation_of_a/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share</a><br /><br />*edit<br />I wrongly said a pro-rata dividend is total value of the sale/holders<br />whereas I should have said<br />total value of the sale/issued shares.<br /><br />any shorts that didn't cover on the record date would then be trapped and be owning a debt of a Series A Preferred Stock...and like I inferred I'm my article, to meet their contractual obligations and close those contracts short sellers would have to buy $MMAT in lieu of $TRCH shares need (as trch no longer exists)<br /><br />&quot;they are preferred shares for a reason&quot;<br /><br />-GP<br /><br />this video is my opinion, not advice and I am not an advisor.{% endraw %}
