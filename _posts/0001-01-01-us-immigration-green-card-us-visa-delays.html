{% raw %}US Immigration.  <br /><br />Possible Immigration Delays due to US Govt shutdown. <br /><br />As Fiscal Year 2022 federal budget negotiations continue, U.S. government funding could expire on December 3, 2021 unless Congress passes spending legislation to avoid a partial government shutdown. In the event of a shutdown, some immigration processes would be suspended and several others should be unaffected, but the shut down can inflict, further processing delays for your GreenCard &amp; Visa Processing, this might even worsen the Visa and Greencard backlog situation. Will your immigration case be affected?.  <br /><br />A shutdown is not certain. The Fiscal Year 2022 budget and related legislative measures are being actively negotiated, and Congress has the option of enacting short-term funding to keep the government open during these negotiations, as it has done several times in recent years during similar budget discussions. This week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a stopgap spending measure, to fund the federal government at its current levels through December 3rd  2021. Likelihood of passage in the Senate is unclear, but there is concern among legislators and government officials about the negative impact of even a partial government shutdown during the COVID emergency.
