{% raw %}In this episode of the Billy Yang Podcast, I sat down with ultra athlete Zach Miller for a podcast talking running and racing, coming back from injury and some of his overall life philosophy. The conversation picks up where we last saw Zach in his film as a caretaker at Barr Camp to a now, a life on the road in his converted bus traveling through North America. We cover our summer at Hardrock, uncertainty around coming back from his injury, the pros and cons of social media, the recent passing of his grandmother and her legacy and much more. <br /><br />ZACH film: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/xvJMlwNUAsI">https://youtu.be/xvJMlwNUAsI</a><br />Cover photo by: Alexis Berg<br /><br />If you would like to support my work, consider donating to my Patreon page at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/BillyYang">https://www.patreon.com/BillyYang</a><br /><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/billyyang/">https://www.instagram.com/billyyang/</a><br />STRAVA: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/1484097">https://www.strava.com/athletes/1484097</a><br /><br />______________<br /><br />Â© Billy Yang Films, LLC 2021<br /><br />Twitter: @BillyYang<br />Instagram: @BillyYangPodcast<br />Facebook: @BillyYangPodcast<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.billyyangfilms.com/">http://www.billyyangfilms.com/</a>{% endraw %}
