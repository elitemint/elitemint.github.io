{% raw %}It's everyone's favorite strike, Exodus Crash!  I think this and by extension Hollowed Lair are a bit better on GM because all of those immunity phases actually feel like they have impact compared to just running them on normal mode.  Anyway, here's a guide.<br /><br />Guns, Subclasses and Mods - 0:00<br />Shut Up, What's The Strat? - 5:19<br />Boss Kill w/ Comms - 14:07<br /><br />Loadouts: I ran double fusion, Jotunn and Threaded Needle, Clyde ran Divinity and an auto, barely used his power weapon, Sneaky ran an Ager's Scepter super energy spam build since we had 2 Warlocks for a run.  I would recommend double fusion or at least 1 person who is able to stack Particle Deconstruction quickly for everyone else.<br /><br />Supers: Well of Radiance, Banner Shield, Shadowshot.  Don't bother getting fancy, don't bother with much else.  Just play it safe.  There is no need for much else.  Stasis is ok, but with so many Overload Champions and Stasis potentially messing up stuns, you can skip it, although it can be helpful with all the trash mobs.<br /><br />Mods: I ran double arc resistance and Protective Light as I usually do, although I did try an Elemental Well build that in theory I liked, but in practice, I just wasn't executing on.  I don't think you need to get fancy here either, Withering Heat, Particle Decon, any of the seasonal stasis mods if you have someone running stasis, scavs, finders and champion stuns.  Keep it simple.<br /><br />Yes, I'm making a video about the dungeon situation.<br /><br />5% discount on ASTRO gear: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.astro.family/DATTO">http://www.astro.family/DATTO</a> (works in all available regions)<br /><br />Save $50 dollars when you buy a pre-built PC from Evolve PCs when you use code DATTO at checkout: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.evolvepcs.gg">https://www.evolvepcs.gg</a><br /><br />Epic Games Store Creator Code: HelloDatto<br /><br />Danielle's Advanced.GG code: TRVL at checkout (Datto has no affiliation with advanced.gg)<br /><br />Need a good chair?
