I was born and raised on a sheep farm watching my dad who was the shepherd.<br /><br />At 18 I went away from farming to work in the city (something I still do) and at 23 (2013) I decided I wanted to do something for some extra money so I went on a sheep shearing course. The hardest thing I’ll ever do was learning to shear sheep. [shudders thinking about it]<br /><br />I shore whilst on my holidays from work for 2 years and then in 2015 my dad died so I decided to get my own sheep so I could continue working with sheep as it was something I loved doing. From there it escalated quickly from my first 4 sheep in my mum’s garden to now running around 600 breeding ewes.<br /><br />I shore over 15,000 sheep this season in UK and I also travel to Norway for shearing in March and September. (Covid messed it up this year)<br /><br />A few years ago I bought myself a sheep pregnancy scanner and have been building up my run since then.  <br /><br />I watched a few farm vlogs on YouTube and decided I could have a go and now here we are!<br /><br />Thanks for watching my videos and please subscribe if you want to see more in future.{% endraw %}
