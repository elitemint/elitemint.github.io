{% raw %}he four young men who make up contemporary R&amp;B group Prophet Jones loaded up their self-titled debut album on the estimable Motown label with all the right elements for success. From smooth, multi-part harmony vocals to hip-hop inflected delivery, from lush R&amp;B ballads to thumping, danceable beats, Prophet Jones seems to have all the bases covered. Accordingly, this album quickly leaped into the Billboard charts immediately upon its release. It's not hard to hear why. The group's considerable vocal chops are wrapped around some sure-fire hooks (even if one tune, &quot;Doin' Me,&quot; seems uncomfortably close to Warren G's &quot;Regulate&quot;). And Prophet Jones's chosen subject matter tends toward the time-honored boot-knockin' that's been the province of successful R&amp;B singers from day one.{% endraw %}
