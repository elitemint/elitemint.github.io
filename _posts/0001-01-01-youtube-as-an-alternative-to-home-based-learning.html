{% raw %}The goal of this project was to examine the reception that students had on teachers’ YouTube videos as learning tools during school closure and national lockdown. Since early 2020, schools have been ordered to close several times due to the unpredictable number of cases that seemed to surge in several waves. Consequently, students and teachers had to adapt to virtual platforms and digital tools as an alternative to physical classroom lessons. The study was conducted on a group of early childhood education students at a vocational college in Sabah. These students were expected to attend a series of tutorials by tuning in to the Youtube videos originally created by their teacher. The videos contained explanations and demonstrations of materials development and teaching techniques related to the curriculum in early childhood education. The feasibility of such approach was assessed through students’ perception and understanding of the topics. The instruments were questionnaire, open-ended questions and students’ performance in assessment tasks. The findings revealed that such approach appeared to be effective in meeting students’ individual pace in learning while encouraging them to be more creative.{% endraw %}
