{% raw %}This term &quot;mitochondrial dysfunction&quot; or &quot;mitochondrial syndrome&quot; is increasingly being talked about in regard to detoxification.  What is it?  What does it mean?  Where are the mitochondria and how are they linked to mould exposure? This week's episode is going to cover this fascinating topic.  <br /><br />REFERENCES:<br /><br />Wang, L., Li, W., Cheng, D. et al.
