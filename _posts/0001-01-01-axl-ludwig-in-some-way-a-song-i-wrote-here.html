{% raw %}A song I wrote, here is the lyrics.<br /><br />When you are sad or feeling lonely<br />You´ll find my footprints inside yourself<br />Like a memory, a postcard  <br />Or my guitar pick on your shelf<br /><br />The shadows´s long from the mountain tops<br />They were keeping my cries at bay<br />Now I fly high as an eagle<br />Over your house everyday<br /><br />I´m still here In some way<br /><br />From now on I can´t scare you<br />With the chance that I´ll leave too soon<br />Instead I can be a rosebud<br />Or the bright side of the moon<br /><br />I can be a sound in the forest<br />The motion in a wave<br />The fire in your chest my love<br />Every time you need to be brave<br /><br />I am still here in some way<br /><br />It´s hard to say ”I love you”<br />When I´m six feet under ground<br />I would like to kiss your cheeks<br />And say ”baby you are number one”<br /><br />I wish that I could be there<br />Every time something is wrong<br />But the best that I can give you<br />Is this very fucked up song{% endraw %}
