{% raw %}Do this workout everyday to see major weight loss results!!<br /><br />Are you ready to burn MAX calories? This workout is for you!! This 3 mile workout will NOT disappoint you! Make sure to share and track your progress in the comments to encourage all your fellow walkers who are doing this at home.<br /><br />This workout requires only your own body weight and can be done virtually anywhere. It is beginner friendly, and if you want to make it even more challenging, you can add some small 3-5lb weights. <br /><br />I did this workout with my bodyweight alone and i was sore (this is coming from someone who has been working out for over 10 years!)<br /><br />If you struggle with any of the moves, ITS OKAY, just keep stepping. This will keep your heart rate up, which is optimal for elevating your metabolism and burning the most amount of calories possible! This workout is great for your heart health, and also GREAT for your mood! <br /><br />If you struggle with getting the entire workout done just come back tomorrow and try to go for a little longer. There is nothing wrong with building your way up to doing this full workout! We all start somewhere and there is NO shame whatsoever in going at your own pace.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with my walking workouts, also make sure to check out the rest of my walking workouts. They are quick, fun, and really pack the burn (trust me i am not just saying this, i sweat like CRAZY when i do these workouts).<br /><br />Workout: 40s exercise, 20s walk<br />1.walk on the spot <br />2.wide walk &amp; arm swing x2<br />3.narrow jog x2<br />4.side to side praise bounce x2<br />5. high knee march x2<br />6. knee up pumpers x2<br />7. kick &amp; reach x2<br />8. side shuffle x2<br />9. kick forward and back x2<br />10. step back &amp; ground tap x2<br />11. standing rock wall climb x2<br />12. alternating star jacks x2<br />13. curtsy ground taps x2<br />14. bounce &amp; hip twist x2<br />15. side to side 90 degree curls x2<br />16. step back &amp; knee drive x2<br />17. half squat step out x2<br />18. heel taps x2<br />19. pull down ball slam  x2<br />20. 4 corner punches x2<br />21. speed feet &amp; side punch x2<br />22. rumba arm roll &amp; butt kick x2<br />23. side step kick out x2<br /><br />giveaway link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.iluslabel.com/">https://www.iluslabel.com/</a><br /><br />To get the BEST (AND QUICKER) RESULTS, follow a nutrition plan that supports your goals.
