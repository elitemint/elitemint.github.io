{% raw %}The La Palma / Cumbre Vieja eruption is now in its 65th day. Today's main news is that the official confirmation of the eruption magnitude being upgraded from VEI 2 to VEI 3 occurred, as declared by involcan. Additionally, a large phreatomagmatic explosion occurred due to a patch of groundwater flashing to steam adjacent to the active vents. Although eruptive activity is truly decreasing, a large magnitude 5.1 earthquake struck the island on November 19th. This video will discuss what is likely to happen next as this Spanish Canary Island volcano. <br /><br />Social media link(s) of a scientific organization which can provide more up to date information:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.involcan.org/">http://www.involcan.org/</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/INVOLCAN">https://www.facebook.com/INVOLCAN</a>   <br /><br />Special Thanks: TV Canarias, INVOLCAN, @efadi_LP (idafe.com)<br /><br />If you would like to support this channel, consider becoming a patron at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/geologyhub.">http://patreon.com/geologyhub.</a><br /><br />Another way to support this channel is to make an order via our gemstone and geology related etsy store at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://prospectingarizona.etsy.com.">http://prospectingarizona.etsy.com.</a>{% endraw %}
