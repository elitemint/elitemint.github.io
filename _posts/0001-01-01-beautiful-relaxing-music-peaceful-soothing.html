{% raw %}Beautiful Relaxing Music, Peaceful Soothing Instrumental Music, &quot;Dreams of Hawaii&quot; By Tim Janis.  My instrumental music can help you find deep relaxation, relieve anxiety, and find peace. My music incorporates relaxing sounds of nature and features flute music, piano music, harp music, &amp; violin music. I am a composer from Maine and created my channel as a place to visit, relax and find peace.<br /><br />In this video we journey through the beautiful Hawaiian Islands. Through mountains, beautiful beaches and coral reeds.
