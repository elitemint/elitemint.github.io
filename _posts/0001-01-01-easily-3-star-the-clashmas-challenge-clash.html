{% raw %}How to Complete the Clashmas Challenge in Clash of Clans. Judo Sloth Gaming provides a Tutorial Guide for this new event and exactly how to Best 3 Star the Clashmas Event. The Air Troops have a different AI to ground troops and choose a random spot on their desired building; so whilst this challenge is very easy with this strategy, there is a rare chance the troops can pat slightly different. I have worked for HOURS to find the best method to ensure Super Minions and Grand Warden go to the core. Be sure to share your 3 Star Success and best of luck.
