{% raw %}SATSANG OF THE WEEK<br />mooji.tv/satsang-of-the-week<br /><br />In this powerful and rich Satsang, Moojibaba guides us into the direct experience of our true Self, and shows us how to navigate the resistances that come from the mind and the challenges which life will bring.<br /><br />“If you have that attitude, ‘I’m totally here for this,’ then Grace put that attitude in you. Come what may, however much the tree of life is changing, my roots are in you. My roots are in the True. <br /><br />With such an attitude, how can you fail? <br /><br />You’re waking up in love, through love, for love. This love is life itself.”<br /><br />A touching follow up meeting took place with the second questioner after this Satsang and can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vimeo.com/347914398/da126c619e">https://vimeo.com/347914398/da126c619e</a><br /><br />~<br /><br />8 July 2019<br />Monte Sahaja, Portugal<br /><br />Music before Satsang: &quot;Hare Ram, Hare Krishna&quot; (traditional Indian Bhajan) performed by Mahababa, Viktor Nemeth &amp; Arun Melwani<br /><br />~<br /><br />This video is the ‘Satsang of the Week’ for 14 July 2019<br />To subscribe or watch this weekly service, please visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mooji.tv/satsang-of-the-week">https://mooji.tv/satsang-of-the-week</a><br /><br />#Mooji #satsang #spirituality #advaita #nonduality #awakening{% endraw %}
