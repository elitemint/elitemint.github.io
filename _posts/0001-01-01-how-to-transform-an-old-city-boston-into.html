As founder and CEO of Endeca, he reimagined the database to support faceted information ultimately leading to Oracle acquiring the company as its 6th largest acquisition ever when announced (reported at $1.1 billion).<br /><br />He was part of the team creating Akamai that reimagined global Internet content distribution – now carrying peaks of 15 terabits/s of web traffic on any given day – and led the team at Inktomi that reimagined the network cache to create carrier class caching. Earlier he worked with AT&amp;T Teradata where enterprise computing was reimagined with the first use of Intel processors for enterprise servers.
