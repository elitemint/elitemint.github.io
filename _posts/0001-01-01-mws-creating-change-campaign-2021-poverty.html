{% raw %}A moving story of one mother's silent struggle and budding hope, watch the third installation of MWS Creating Change Campaign's video that explores the issue of poverty based on a true story. <br /><br />Peering into the life of Miko Lew, a mother caring for her elderly in-laws and schooling children, catch a glimpse of the complex challenges many families like hers face, and the hope sustainable change brings. Today, we rejoice with Miko over her transformation and are grateful for volunteers like Josephine who walk faithfully as a friend. Hear directly from them as they share their hearts at the end.<br /><br />MWS seeks to empower many more on their journey towards holistic well-being. Beyond addressing financial needs, our person-centred approach across all our 21 Centres and Programmes provides emotional, relational, and psychosocial support.<br /><br />Find out more about how you can be an agent of sustainable change at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mws.sg/creating-change/">https://mws.sg/creating-change/</a>{% endraw %}
