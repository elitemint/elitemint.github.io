{% raw %}Patients that regularly try to adjust their own back can either have really LOUD back crunches like this patient (because, to be honest, she saved them all for me) or have nothing to release at all - which is oftentimes disappointing to the patient. Patients oftentimes come in already popping and cracking segments of the spine that they shouldn't, but are seeking relief of their spinal symptoms. Chiropractic is useful in that we can set and align the boney structures of the spine (subluxations) and provide relief for this type of patient. I often advise not try and attempt to adjust the structures of the the neck while I'm treating them as this doesn't allow me to properly evaluate my work when bones are being manipulated constantly by the patient. Sometimes, I will refuse to see a patient if they can't break the habit! <br />DISCLAIMER: THIS VIDEO IS FOR ENTERTAINMENT AS WELL AS EDUCATION.
