Several PA officials attended the event: PA Minister of Education Ali Zaidan (Abu Zuhri), Fatah Central Committee member Tawfiq Tirawi, Advisor to PA Chairman Abbas on NGOs and Member of Fatah Central Committee Sultan Abu Al-Einein, District Governor of Bethlehem Abd Al-Fattah Hamayel and Director of the Bethlehem Education Administration Nisreen Yasser Amr.<br /><br />Fatah Central Committee member Tawfiq Tirawi: &quot;I say, from a position of responsibility, not a centimeter of Jerusalem will be liberated unless every grain of Palestinian soil is soaked in the blood of its brave people. For Jerusalem doesn't need negotiations, because negotiations will not bring Jerusalem back to us. What will bring back Jerusalem are the struggle and the resolve... We have conducted negotiations, while not laying down the rifle. It [the rifle] may be resting but we will not neglect our principles. We will rest the fighter's rest, but each period has its method of struggle. From fighting to Intifada, to popular resistance, to negotiations -- but we will not abandon [our principles] -- not in negotiations and not in any other way. I say, from a position of responsibility, the negotiations resulted in nothing except for the [release of the] prisoners.&quot; <br />[Official PA TV Live, Dec. 19, 2013]{% endraw %}
