My name is Erika Kullberg.  I'm a lawyer by profession, but my passion is personal finance. After I graduated, I had over $200,000 of student debt, so I made it my mission to dive into everything personal finance-related, so I could equip myself with the tools to pay off the student loans as quickly as possible.  I ended up paying them off in under 2 years, and now it's my passion project to share with you all of the strategies I've used to pay off my student loans, increase my net worth, credit card hack (travel on points), invest, house hack (invest in real estate), build passive income streams, and more.  I hope you'll join me on the channel!<br /><br />ðŸ“® LET'S CONNECT!<br />SUBSCRIBE to my channel<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoSw1rKMkCbwzKpkC0OjRKA?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoSw1rKMkCbwzKpkC0OjRKA?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />----------<br />Instagram<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/erikankullberg">https://www.instagram.com/erikankullberg</a><br />----------<br />Facebook<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/erikankullberg/">https://www.facebook.com/erikankullberg/</a><br />----------<br />Website<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://erikakullberg.com">http://erikakullberg.com</a><br />----------<br />Guide to Legally Protecting Your Business<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plugandlaw.com/legal-guide">https://plugandlaw.com/legal-guide</a><br /><br /><br />NOTE: This description contains some affiliate links, meaning that I may earn a minimal commission if you click through and use these links (at no additional cost to you).<br /><br />Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.
