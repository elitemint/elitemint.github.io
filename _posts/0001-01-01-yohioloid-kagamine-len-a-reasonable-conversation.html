{% raw %}&quot;I can fix him&quot; - Pais Sleepinggods<br />-<br />Well, you can say a lot about Dalanthan Moless, but you can’t call him an unbeliever. As a Sleepless Star, he worships Fate, who, thousands of years ago, knocked the other Gods unconscious, and he devoutly follows the major tenet of his religion: sleep is for the weak. Close your eyes and you’re basically asking to die. With all those waking hours to kill, it’s just as well he’s picked up some…unorthodox hobbies.<br />But now he’s travelling with Pais, who has to make this whole big thing about ‘ethics’ and ‘being a good person’. Bad luck indeed.<br />-<br />New entry in the Sleeping Gods song series! And this one’s kind of weird. I don’t think anyone outside of the friend group will get particularly much out of it, so sorry about that!<br />Early Dalanthan and Pais interaction was basically exactly what you’d expect from the conscience of the party and the murder hobo. I hope I’ve managed to  capture the vibe!<br />Sorry for not uploading for a year. Basically, I got extremely sick and couldn’t make anything. Things are better now and I hope to be able to post at least semi-regularly.<br />-<br />if you point out the typo in this video i reserve the right to block you :(<br />-<br />Murasaki Kujaku's instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/murasakikujaku/">https://www.instagram.com/murasakikujaku/</a><br />Thanks again, Mura—and sorry for taking so long to get this out after you sent me the art. Pleasure working with you as always!<br />-<br />LYRICS: <br />DALANTHAN:<br />Doncha know<br />Fate has a plan for you<br />And when he sends a sign you better follow his cue<br />And you can't escape it anyway no matter what you do<br />So you might as well accept the choice was never with you<br /><br />Doncha know<br />Fate has a plan for you<br />And when he sends a sign you better follow his cue<br />And you can't escape it anyway no matter what you do<br />So you might as well accept the choice was never with you<br /><br />Oh<br />Some people wanna do good<br />With the 'right thing' they're obsessed<br />Personally, never really got the appeal<br />But it's fine for them I guess<br /><br />Well, some people wanna change me<br />And that's where I have to draw the line<br />Turn around my life for peace and harmony?<br />Uh, thanks? But I think I'll be fine<br /><br />Here's a rule that I thought went unspoken:<br />You can't fix what has never been broken<br /><br />Doncha know<br />Fate has a plan for you<br />And when he sends a sign you better follow his cue<br />And you can't escape it anyway no matter what you do<br />So you might as well accept the choice was never with you<br /><br />Doncha know<br />Fate has a plan for you<br />And when he sends a sign you better follow his cue<br />And you can't escape it anyway no matter what you do<br />So you might as well accept the choice was never with you<br /><br />PAIS:<br />Faith as your sanction to justify injustice<br />Reminds me of a place I used to know<br />You’re so far gone that frankly I’m disgusted<br />Every word you say is a psychic blow<br />But even so, oh, no matter how you posture<br />There’s more to you, of that I have no doubt<br />‘Cause thing is, Dalanthan, nobody’s born a monster<br />What’s your problem? Help me help you out<br /><br />DALANTHAN:<br />I don't kill people 'cause I have a reason<br />I kill people 'cause it's fun!<br />Prowling the night, because sleeping would be treason<br />And if you see me coming, you should run<br />Dice and cards and violence and drinking<br />I'm the kind of person you should hate<br />Keeping myself far too busy to be thinking<br />That's the kind of thing I leave to Fate<br /><br />PAIS:<br />You're deranged<br /><br />DALANTHAN:<br />That so?<br /><br />PAIS:<br />But you can change!<br /><br />DALANTHAN:<br />Uh, no?<br /><br />PAIS:<br />Show a little kindness, get it back in exchange!<br /><br />DALANTHAN:<br />And you believe that?<br /><br />PAIS:<br />I do<br /><br />DALANTHAN:<br />Then you're naive, cat<br /><br />PAIS:<br />Says you!<br /><br />DALANTHAN:<br />And this world is gonna have you dead in five seconds flat<br /><br />PAIS: <br />Hey!<br /><br />DALANTHAN:<br />You complain, but the real biggest danger<br />Is all this trust that you put into strangers <br /><br />Doncha know<br />Fate has a plan for you<br />And when he sends a sign you better follow his cue<br />And you can't escape it anyway no matter what you do<br />So you might as well accept the choice was never with you<br /><br />DALANTHAN (PAIS):<br />Doncha know<br />Fate has a plan for you (Faith in strangers is all I’ve got!)<br />And when he sends you a sign you better follow his cue (Maybe it’s naïve, but it’s what they)<br />And you can't escape it anyway no matter what you do (Need, and you’d be so much happier)<br />So you might as well accept the choice was never with you (If you’d just give it a shot) <br /><br />DALANTHAN:<br />Listen, cat<br />Let me explain some stuff<br />It’s not like I’m gonna kill you so no need to act tough<br />It’s an amnesty for teammates, and I swear that’s not a bluff<br />I won’t murder those I travel with, is that not enough?<br /><br />PAIS: <br />Well, for now at least, I’m guessing<br /><br />BOTH:<br />It will have to be enough<br />-<br />follow my socials!<br />tumblr: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://deadrosencrantz.tumblr.com/">https://deadrosencrantz.tumblr.com/</a><br />twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/twink_skywalker">https://twitter.com/twink_skywalker</a><br />soundcloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/rosencrantz-117997391">https://soundcloud.com/rosencrantz-117997391</a><br />twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/dead_rosencrantz">https://www.twitch.tv/dead_rosencrantz</a><br />discord server: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/GBPcy7PkCk">https://discord.gg/GBPcy7PkCk</a>{% endraw %}
