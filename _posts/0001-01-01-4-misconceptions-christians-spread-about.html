{% raw %}Dr. Bart Ehrman joins me here to discuss extremely common misconceptions about the New Testament and early Christianity. The misconceptions are: <br />“The gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, were written by eyewitnesses, possibly the apostles themselves.”<br />“Christianity was relatively unified in the first few centuries, and only became theologically diverse and fragmented with time. The further you go back, the more united Christianity is.”<br />“The proto-orthodox church fathers did not accept the authority of any texts we’d now consider non-canonical, such as the apocalypse of Peter.”<br />“Legendary accounts of Jesus birth, ministry, and death did not have time to form by the time the Gospels were written. So, the gospel accounts are purely historical.”<br /> <br />Check out and sign up for Dr. Ehrman’s webinar here (thanks for the support!):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gmskeptic--ehrman.thrivecart.com/did-the-christmas-story-really-happen/">https://gmskeptic--ehrman.thrivecart.com/did-the-christmas-story-really-happen/</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />-------------------------------------------FOLLOW-------------------------------------------<br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/gm_skeptic">https://twitter.com/gm_skeptic</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/GMSkeptic/">https://www.facebook.com/GMSkeptic/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />-------------------------------------------SUPPORT-------------------------------------------<br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/GeneticallyModifiedSkeptic">https://www.patreon.com/GeneticallyModifiedSkeptic</a><br />PayPal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/GMSkeptic">https://www.paypal.me/GMSkeptic</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />-------------------------------------------Resources for atheists in need-------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />Find a Secular Therapist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.seculartherapy.org">https://www.seculartherapy.org</a><br /><br />Recovering from Religion helps connect those who are leaving or have left their religion with support, resources and community: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.recoveringfromreligion.org/#rfr-welcome">https://www.recoveringfromreligion.org/#rfr-welcome</a><br /><br />Resources for Ex-Mu’s: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://exmuslims.org/join-us/">https://exmuslims.org/join-us/</a><br /><br />The Deconstruction Network: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.phildrysdale.com/">https://www.phildrysdale.com/</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This video contains 100% therapeutic grade skepticism.*<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />*This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA{% endraw %}
