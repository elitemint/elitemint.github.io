{% raw %}&quot;The mind is very restless, turbulent, strong and obstinate, O Krishna. It appears to me that it is more difficult to control than the wind&quot; - Bhagavad Gita (6.34)<br />&quot;Lord Krishna said: O mighty-armed son of Kunti, what you say is correct; the mind is indeed very difficult to restrain. But by practice and detachment, it can be controlled&quot; -  Bhagavad Gita (6.35)<br /><br />Inspired by these verses, Swami Sarvapriyananda provides invaluable guidance on improving our meditation.<br /><br />► To support the Vedanta Society of New York:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.vedantany.org/donate">http://www.vedantany.org/donate</a><br /><br />Vedanta NY Archives: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/VedantaNewYorkArchives">https://www.youtube.com/c/VedantaNewYorkArchives</a><br />Web: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://vedantany.org">http://vedantany.org</a><br />Soundcloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://Soundcloud.com/VedantaNY">http://Soundcloud.com/VedantaNY</a><br />iTunes Podcast: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/vedanta-talks-itunes">http://bit.ly/vedanta-talks-itunes</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IrDmqXhiGwwyQcIUjRhtB">https://open.spotify.com/show/5IrDmqXhiGwwyQcIUjRhtB</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/VedantaNY">https://www.facebook.com/VedantaNY</a><br /><br />ABOUT VEDANTA<br />Vedanta is one of the world’s most ancient religious philosophies and one of its broadest.
