In telling your story.”<br />― Gary Vaynerchuk<br /><br />Personally, I’m a huge fan of Gary Vaynerchuk. I love what the guy represents. His success as an Entrepreneur has truly inspired me and he has done an unbelievable amount of good in the business world. His views on life and on business have been a breath of fresh air. Gary’s insane hustle and work ethic are the kinds of things that not enough people in this world seem to possess nowadays.<br />I finished reading this particular book last night and I have to say that once again Gary provided me with practical knowledge I can apply in my own life to better my situation. This book is filled with smart business ideas you can use to give yourself a better chance of becoming a successful Entrepreneur.<br /><br />Create Valuable Content<br /><br />Throughout the book, Gary emphasizes the importance of creating valuable content be it through a blog, vlog, podcast, website, etc. Gary is all about creating value for other people and I absolutely love that about him. Being a Blogger myself, I never truly appreciated the importance of the words I type until after reading this book. My Blog has the potential to reach countless people all around the world, and Gary reminded me that I always need to remain authentic and be conscious of the message I am putting out into the world.<br />Be it the written word, audio, or video — choose your platform carefully. This is another point that Gary does a fantastic job of driving home throughout the book. It is a good reminder for us to focus on our strengths and be self-aware of what our weaknesses are as well. It doesn’t mean you can’t choose all 3 platforms, but you need to focus on choosing the best platform for you initially where you can give yourself the best chance of success.<br /><br />Become An Influencer<br /><br />Gary also does a phenomenal job of painting the big picture of what your life can look like when you have consistently put out high-quality content over a long period of time. When you have a solid following and large corporations start hearing about you on social media, oftentimes these same corporations might contact you and want you to endorse their products for them to your large audience. This is one of the main reasons why certain people out there are considered “social media influencers”. These people are their own personal brand and they are a respected brand.<br />Gary Vaynerchuk reminded me with this book that having a high-quality personal brand is essential in today’s ultra-competitive society. You are a walking business, everything you do and say can set you up for success or failure in the business world.<br /><br />#Business #Leadership #passion{% endraw %}
