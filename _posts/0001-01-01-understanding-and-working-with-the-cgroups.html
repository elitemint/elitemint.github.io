{% raw %}Understanding and Working with the Cgroups Interface - Michael Anderson, The PTR Group, LLC<br /><br />The cgroups (control group) interface was added to the mainline kernel in 2.6.24 and is a major feature of the container models such as Docker and LXC/LXD. However, you don't find many references to the use of cgroups in the embedded space. In fact, the cgroups code can provide a wealth of options to the embedded developer. In this session, we will describe the major features of control groups and how they can be used in both affecting control and testing major code features during the debugging process.{% endraw %}
