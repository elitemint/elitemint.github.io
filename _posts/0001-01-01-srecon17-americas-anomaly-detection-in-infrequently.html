In this talk, we will introduce our approaches used to deal with such issues. Our scenarios are actually more complicated in that, in China, the holidays do not have the fixed calendar dates, and different holidays have absolutely different traffic patterns. However the practical deployment of the methods in this talk shows the pretty satisfying results in terms of alarming precision and recall.<br /><br />View the full SREcon17 Americas Program at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon17americas/program">https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon17americas/program</a>{% endraw %}
