{% raw %}In this video,  I'll be covering the fashion of The Chanels from Scream Queens Season 1. The Chanels are the beautiful, wealthy, popular, and stylish clique of haughty girls belonging to the most demanding sorority Kappa Kappa Tau at Wallace University. The main three members of the posse are the queen- Chanel Oberlin, Sadie Swenson or Chanel #3, and Libby Putney aka Chanel #5. The cohesive and glamorous style of the Chanels is one that has grown to be iconic and visually captivating on-screen with a great impact off. I’ll be analyzing the overall quintessential fashion of the Chanels and breaking down each of the member’s distinctive styles in relation to their personal attributes. <br />We will be taking a look at styling techniques, the designer brands of choices, the coveted look, and the symbolism of ensembles within and outside of the Chanels’ group-think. I’ll also be covering the psychology and sociology of the girl posse of identical name and the phenomenon of the inexplicably identical individuals to see how the behaviors, belief systems, and the look of the overall group identity of the “Chanels” impacts each member. Through this, we will understand this style of personal fashion as an aesthetic and each of the members' styles on an individual level as well as how it functions in the world as a clique.<br /><br />CONTENT:<br />INTRODUCTION - 0:00 <br />THE VISUAL NARRATIVE OF HIGH FASHION - 1:15<br />THE AESTHETIC OF THE CHANELS - 3:36<br />INEXPLICABLY IDENTICAL INDIVIDUALS - 5:00<br />THE MEANING OF OBERLIN'S LOOKS - 7:21<br />CHANEL #3 &amp; #5'S SYMBOLIC STYLE - 9:49<br />CONCLUSION - 13:23<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CleverAndChic/">https://www.youtube.com/c/CleverAndChic/</a><br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/cleverchic">https://twitter.com/cleverchic</a><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/thecleverandchic/">https://instagram.com/thecleverandchic/</a><br />PINTEREST: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pinterest.com/cleverandchic/">https://pinterest.com/cleverandchic/</a><br />JOIN: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ohkwMsZHsV5dEE4boU0Lg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ohkwMsZHsV5dEE4boU0Lg/join</a><br /><br />MUSIC: Fashion House - Kosatka<br /><br />SOURCES:<br />Costume Designer Interview- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fashionista.com/2015/09/scream-queens-costumes-lou-eyrich">https://fashionista.com/2015/09/scream-queens-costumes-lou-eyrich</a><br />10 Questions with SCREAM QUEENS Costume Designer Lou Eyrich- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.whowhatwear.com/scream-queens-fox-2015">https://www.whowhatwear.com/scream-queens-fox-2015</a><br />Scream Queens and Style .com- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fashionista.com/2015/09/scream-queens-costumes-lou-eyrich">https://fashionista.com/2015/09/scream-queens-costumes-lou-eyrich</a><br />Scream Queens Bios/Timelines- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://scream-queens.fandom.com/wiki/Scream_Queens_Wiki">https://scream-queens.fandom.com/wiki/Scream_Queens_Wiki</a><br />TV Tropes- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tvtropes.org/">https://tvtropes.org/</a><br />Chanels Style- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eonline.com/photos/17280/scream-queens-style-how-to-be-a-chanel-in-9-easy-steps">https://www.eonline.com/photos/17280/scream-queens-style-how-to-be-a-chanel-in-9-easy-steps</a><br />Enclothed Cognition- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103112000200">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103112000200</a><br />Mission statement - <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.valleymagazinepsu.com/the-history-mystery-and-wonder-of-moschino/#:~:text=In%201983%2C%20Moschino's%20vision%20came,having%20fun%E2%80%9D%20while%20staying%20grounded.">http://www.valleymagazinepsu.com/the-history-mystery-and-wonder-of-moschino/#:~:text=In%201983%2C%20Moschino's%20vision%20came,having%20fun%E2%80%9D%20while%20staying%20grounded.</a><br /><br /><br />Copyright Disclaimer under section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education and research.
