{% raw %}Midday stroll in the sand at Barceloneta Beach. Good weather at mid October which led to many people to come to the beach.<br /><br />Barcelona city coastline is made up of six beaches in a single stretch of line: San Sebestián, La Barceloneta, Somorrostro, Nova Icaria, Bogatell, Mar Bella and Nova Mar Bella.<br /><br />There is a good assortment of restaurants and beach bars along the main beaches. During the summer hundreds of people gather in the sand to start a party.<br />This is a newly created channel and I'm publishing at least two videos a week. Please consider subscribe if you want to see more content and hit the 'Like' button if you enjoy my videos.<br /><br />This channel features relaxing strolls on the beach with the sound of breaker waves washing the shore and exiting walks on the animated buzzing of beach bars and hectic characters.<br /><br />Beaches have a world on their own, from urban beaches to remote coves. The lively atmosphere of Ipanema, La Barceloneta or Maspalomas, to the inner peace of Famara or Cofete.<br /><br />If you are planning a trip to any of the places I depict in my videos, I hope you find them useful, as this is my main intention.<br /><br />Please feel free to leave a comment with your feedback and suggestions.<br /><br />You can also visit my other channel, which shows sightseeing walks in cities and music summaries of places I visited: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfZkhKCyCCkfSVS2a4b4zVA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfZkhKCyCCkfSVS2a4b4zVA</a>{% endraw %}
