Unfortunately, he must choose between two opposing philosophies: Jackie says he should protect himself and fight back, while Marion advocates a non-violent approach. Meanwhile, Tiffany fights with her boyfriend on the telephone and agonizes about whether to call him back or wait for him to call her.{% endraw %}
