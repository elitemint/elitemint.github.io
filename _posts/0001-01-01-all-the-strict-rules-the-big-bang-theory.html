{% raw %}The Big Bang Theory was on screens for more than a decade. And it was a quite hard job for every cast member to keep their show and even make it funnier! So there is no wonder that there were some rules for The Big Bang Theory cast that they had to follow, moreover, one rule is still working!<br /><br />Ossa is going to tell you all about The Big Bang Theory strict rules. What was the hardest rule for The Big Bang Theory actors, especially for Kaley Cuoco (Penny), to follow so they were dreaming about breaking it? Why does no one want to talk about the show‚Äôs pilot episode and what are the differences between it and TBBT that we watched and loved? <br /><br />How did Wil Wheaton‚Äôs and Kevin Sussman‚Äôs (Stuart Bloom) improvisations affect on show‚Äôs plot and was it actually allowed for actors to change the lines? What was the impact of the live audience on the sitcom set? What was Mayim BialiBialik‚Äôs (Amy Farrah Fowler) second job on set and how she was rewarded for it? Why were there only DC heroes‚Äô costumes and no Marvel heroes‚Äô costumes in tv series? <br /><br />What were the rules of style for every character and why only Panny‚Äôs style was various? Why did Kaley Cuoco (Penny), Jim Parson (Sheldon Cooper), and Johny Galecki (Leonard Hofstadter) protest and how did it affect Simon Hilberg (Howard Wolowitz), Kunal Nayyar (Raj Koothrappali), Mayim BialiBialik (Amy Farrah Fowler), Kevin Sussman (Stuart Bloom), and Melissa Rauch (Bernadette Rostenkowski-Wolowitz)? <br /><br />Did every member of TBBT cast get the same salary or was someone richer than others? Why it was okay if suddenly everyone start to dance?
