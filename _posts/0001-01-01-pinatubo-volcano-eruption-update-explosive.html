{% raw %}The Mount Pinatubo volcano in the Philippines just produced a new eruption, sending a plume of ash 14,300 meters or 44,000 feet into the atmosphere. Although the eruption only lasted for four minutes on November 30th, there is a worry that more explosions will occur rather soon. This video will separate fact from fiction, and discuss what size and duration of volcanic activity is expected at Mount Pinatubo. It is a very famous volcano as it produced one of the 20th century's largest explosive eruptions in 1991.<br /><br />Social media link(s) of a scientific organization which can provide more up to date information:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/">https://www.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/</a><br /><br />Special Thanks: Philippines AirAsia Captain Aljess Lasmarias<br /><br />If you would like to support this channel, consider becoming a patron at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/geologyhub.">http://patreon.com/geologyhub.</a><br /><br />Another way to support this channel is to make an order via our gemstone and geology related etsy store at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://prospectingarizona.etsy.com.">http://prospectingarizona.etsy.com.</a>{% endraw %}
