So welcome to Ksenia's vlog.<br /><br />#Russianrecipes #StPetersburg #weekend #vlog<br /><br />▶️ My online store. Check it out! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/troikarussiangoods/shop">https://www.facebook.com/troikarussiangoods/shop</a><br />▶️ My 2nd channel Learn Russian with TV Shows  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2mksbsgHuZCLtVfzRrC1IA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2mksbsgHuZCLtVfzRrC1IA</a><br />▶️ My Instagram @kseniya_zem<br /><br />Oats pancake recipe:<br />30 gr oats<br />1 egg<br />30 ml milk<br />Ricotta for topping<br />Banana for topping<br />Mix oats, egg, and milk with your blender. Heat your skillet. Pour a little vegetable or olive oil. Pour oats-egg-milk mixture on the skillet. Make the surface even, if it's not. Fry a pancake. Divide your pancake by 4 segments. Slice some banana. Mash it with a fork. Take 3 to 4 tea spoons ricotta, add your mashed banana. Mix everything together. Spread the ricotta-banana mixture on the pancake. Make a little cake.<br /><br />Apple puree (mash)  recipe:<br />I take 6 - 8 middle sized apples, wash them, cut out the cores, cut them into segments. Then I take baking paper, lay it on baking tray. Bake the apples in your oven set for convection mode for 20 min on 200 C. Let them cool. Put your baked apples into a jar and mash them with a blender. Sugar free, natural and yammy!<br /><br />Omelette recipe:<br />One tomato<br />1 - 2 cloves garlic<br />100 ml milk (I pour milk estimating by eye)<br />2 eggs<br />Slice your tomato, cut garlic. Simmer tomato and garlic till they get soft. Mix milk and eggs together. Add egg-milk mixture to the vegetables. Fry till it's ready. You can sprinkle your omelette with cheese. Enjoy!!{% endraw %}
