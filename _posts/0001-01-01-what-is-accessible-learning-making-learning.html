{% raw %}Making learning more accessible is a key objective for many organisations, but what does this mean in reality and how do you get started? The focus is all too often on compliance with technical standards, however, this is just one aspect of accessibility and making learning truly accessible requires a broader approach.<br /><br />Shona Smart, Learning Technologies Consultant with eCom, presented a seminar at Learning Technologies called: ‘Accessible Learning – Much More Than Design Standards’. This video is an extract from the seminar in which Shona outlines what accessible learning is and introduces eCom’s recent work with RNIB.<br /><br />To view the recording of the full webinar, please visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ogv2JHeI6f0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ogv2JHeI6f0</a><br /><br />© eCom Scotland Ltd.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ecomscotland.com/">http://www.ecomscotland.com/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ecomscotland">https://twitter.com/ecomscotland</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/eComScotland">https://www.facebook.com/eComScotland</a><br />Linkedin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ecom-scotland">https://www.linkedin.com/company/ecom-scotland</a><br />Youtube channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Ecomscotland">https://www.youtube.com/c/Ecomscotland</a>{% endraw %}
