{% raw %}I used a 250cc engine for buid, the engine has four forward gears and a reverse gear, the wheels are derived from the quad bike, the front is from the motorcycle.  I bought all the parts used from auction sites. <br />I have no experience in building such vehicles, so the work on this  trike motorcycle took some time, but the end result is satisfactory, riding this motorized trike is great fun :){% endraw %}
