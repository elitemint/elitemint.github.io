Now it's time for them to feel.<br /><br />This is the fifth track from Sleeping At Last's Atlas: Year Two.<br /><br />I do not own the rights to this song. All rights belong to Sleeping At Last.<br /><br />Sleeping At Last: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/SleepingAtLast1">http://www.youtube.com/user/SleepingAtLast1</a><br /><br />Lyrics (provided by Peter Little):<br /><br />when will i feel this<br />as vivid as it truly is,<br />fall in love in a single touch,<br />and fall apart when it hurts too much?<br /><br />can we skip past near-death clichés<br />where my heart restarts, as my life replays?<br />all i want is to flip a switch<br />before something breaks that cannot be fixed.<br /><br />i know, i know- the sirens sound<br />just before the walls come down.<br />pain is a well-intentioned weatherman<br />predicting God as best he can,<br />but God i want to feel again.<br /><br />rain or shine, i don’t feel a thing,<br />just some information upon my skin.<br />i miss the subtle aches when the weather changed,<br />the barometric pressure we always blamed.<br /><br />all i want is to flip a switch<br />before something breaks that cannot be fixed.<br /><br />invisible machinery,<br />these moving parts inside of me<br />well, they’ve been shutting down for quite some time,<br />leaving only rust behind.<br /><br />well i know, i know- the sirens sound<br />just before the walls come down.<br />pain is a well-intentioned weatherman<br />predicting God as best he can,<br />but God i want to feel again,<br />oh God i want to feel again.<br /><br />down my arms, a thousand satellites<br />suddenly discover signs of life.{% endraw %}
