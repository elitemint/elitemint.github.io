Farm Aid artists and board members Willie Nelson, Neil Young, John Mellencamp, Dave Matthews and Margo Price host an annual festival to raise funds to support Farm Aid’s work with family farmers and to inspire people to choose family farm food. For more than 35 years, Farm Aid, with the support of the artists who contribute their performances each year, has raised more than $60 million to support programs that help farmers thrive, expand the reach of the Good Food Movement, take action to change the dominant system of industrial agriculture and promote food from family farms.<br /><br />For more information about Farm Aid, visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://farmaid.org ">https://farmaid.org </a> <br /><br />Buy Farm Aid merch at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.farmaid.org">https://shop.farmaid.org</a><br /><br />Farm Aid’s performances are donated by the artists in order to raise funds and raise awareness for family farmers.
