{% raw %}If you have oily skin/pores, then this tutorial is for you! Your pores can’t magically vanish (or even get smaller, for that matter). They can, however, look like they’ve disappeared—all it takes is a good skincare regimen and a few key makeup techniques. Before starting the makeup, always make sure to do a morning regimen and apply sunscreen (extremely important!!), after which you can start your makeup. Lots of love, Smitha<br /><br />❤️Products used in this tutorial (in order):<br />Concealer brush options:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2SQeTKp">https://amzn.to/2SQeTKp</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2SYtzqJ">https://amzn.to/2SYtzqJ</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/34KXTYH">https://amzn.to/34KXTYH</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3idjota">https://amzn.to/3idjota</a><br />Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Facial Moisturizer <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3fRLvN0">https://amzn.to/3fRLvN0</a><br />e.l.f.
