The Boston native, steps back on the scene in search of another triumph with his third LP, “Love and Resistance” which sees the producer diving deeper in his influences that have helped to carved out his sound that he’s mastered.<br /><br />“The strains of Afro and Latin flavors are interwoven and still heavily permeate but the underlying groove and rhythms have taken on a more modern, jazz-funk and disco-soul vibe with nods to Bobby Caldwell, Roy Ayers, the Mizell brothers and Nile Rodgers’ Chic.”{% endraw %}
