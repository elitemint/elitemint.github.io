{% raw %}Hey Guardians! Today we discuss Eris' absence in Season Of The Lost. You would think a character centered around the hive would pop up (even in the lore), but she is no where to be found. Is this strictly for development purposes (as we'll discuss) or does it have a deeper meaning?<br /><br />“Destiny 2 Where Is Eris&quot;<br />“Destiny 2 Season Of The Lost Eris Morn&quot;<br />“Destiny 2 Eris Morn&quot;<br />“Destiny 2 Witch Queen Eris&quot;<br /><br />Thanks for watching! Im Evade and ill catch ya in the next one{% endraw %}
