{% raw %}lyrics:<br /><br />You can still see where the water was<br />In a line at the top of the chimney bricks<br />Sometimes, something so broken can never be fixed<br />So we saved a few things that were spared<br />And brought it to the ground<br />Cause you always build it better the second time around<br /><br />I drove past the place where we use to live<br />Where you said you never wanted kids<br />Sometimes, something so broken can never be fixed<br />I'm sleeping more and eating again<br />I'm starting over like a factory town<br />And you always build it better the second time around<br /><br />You always build it better the second time around<br />You always build it better the second time around<br />You always build it better<br />You always build it better<br />You always build it better the second time around<br />You always build it better the second time around<br />You always build it better the second time around<br />You always build it better the second time around<br /><br />music: ARON WRIGHT<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.aronwright.com/">http://www.aronwright.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/aronwright">https://www.youtube.com/user/aronwright</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/aronwright">https://soundcloud.com/aronwright</a><br /><br />photo:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/26603173@N04/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/26603173@N04/</a>{% endraw %}
