{% raw %}October 4th 2015 Prayer In This Manner&quot; Matthew 6:6-18<br /><br />By Pastor Ray Sleiman<br /><br />Matthew 6:6-18 (ESV)<br />6 But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.<br />7 “And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, forthey think that they will be heard for their many words. 8 Do not be like them,for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. 9 Pray then like this:<br />“Our Father in heaven,<br />hallowed be your name.[a]<br />10 Your kingdom come,<br />your will be done,[b]<br />    on earth as it is in heaven.<br />11 Give us this day our daily bread,[c]<br />12 and forgive us our debts,<br />    as we also have forgiven our debtors.<br />13 And lead us not into temptation,<br />    but deliver us from evil.[d]<br />14 For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, 15 but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.<br />Fasting 16 “And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. 17 But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, 18 that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.<br /><br />Romans 8:26 (ESV)<br />26 Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.<br /><br />Matthew 7:7 (ESV)<br />7 “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.<br /><br />Psalm 145:2-3 (ESV)<br />2 Every day I will bless you<br />    and praise your name forever and ever.<br />3 Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised,<br />    and his greatness is unsearchable.<br /><br />Revelation 11:17 (ESV)<br />17 saying, “We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty,<br />    who is and who was,<br />for you have taken your great power<br />    and begun to reign.<br /><br />1 Peter 3:7 (ESV)<br />7 Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you[a] of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.<br /><br />Matthew 18:19-20 (ESV)<br />19 Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. 20 For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them.”<br /><br />Acts 4:29-31 (ESV)<br />29 And now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant to your servants[a] to continue to speak your word with all boldness, 30 while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of yourholy servant Jesus.” 31 And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness.<br /><br />Matthew 6:9 (ESV)<br />9 Pray then like this:<br />“Our Father in heaven,<br />hallowed be your name.[a]<br /><br />James 5:16 (ESV)<br />16 Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working.[a]<br /><br />1 Thessalonians 5:17 (ESV)<br />17 pray without ceasing,<br /><br />Luke 6:28 (ESV)<br />28 bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you.<br /><br />Luke 18:1 (ESV)<br />18 And he told them a parable to the effect that they ought always to pray and not lose heart.<br /><br />John 16:24 (ESV)<br />24 Until now you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive,that your joy may be full.<br /><br />Matthew 6:9 (ESV)<br />9 Pray then like this:<br />“Our Father in heaven,<br />hallowed be your name.[a]<br /><br />John 14:13 (ESV)<br />13 Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.<br /><br />Psalm 50:15 (ESV)<br />15 and call upon me in the day of trouble;<br />    I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me.”<br /><br />Psalm 109:4 (ESV)<br />4 In return for my love they accuse me,<br />    but I give myself to prayer.[a]<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.gtgchurch.org">http://www.gtgchurch.org</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.lebanonprayergroup.org">http://www.lebanonprayergroup.org</a>{% endraw %}
