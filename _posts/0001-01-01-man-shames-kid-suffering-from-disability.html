There’s this perception out there that when people are sick or disabled, somehow they’re just not as good us. That their lives aren’t as important or as valuable as a healthy person’s. So how do we treat a disabled person? The reality is just because someone may walk, talk or move differently than us, on the inside they are exactly the same. In fact, the biggest disability of all is the one people have on the inside when they judge others based on what they see on the outside.
