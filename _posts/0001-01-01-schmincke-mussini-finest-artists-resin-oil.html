{% raw %}MUSSINI, a resin-oil colour with a long history, is celebrating its 140th anniversary.<br />Developed in 1881 as one of the original products of the Schmincke company and based on old master recipes. The company's founders, Herman Schmincke and Josef Horadam, acquired these recipes from the art professor Cesare Mussini, who taught at the Academy of Fine Arts in Florence. <br /><br />Good to know: with the invention of the tube, resin-oil colours could now be used for plein air painting and thus have beome famous around the world. <br />The true secret of MUSSINI is the combination of selected painter's oils and the best Indonesian Dammar natural resin. The brilliance and the depth effect of the colours are unique, because the natural resin solutions reduce the fatty oils that tend to yellow in the long term and improve the deep drying and light refraction properties. <br />Up to now, only the best pigments are used for this series and with a selection of 108 colours, MUSSINI resin-oil colours are for many oil painters, as well as for Dirk Schmitt, the best thing that can happen to canvas. <br /><br />You will find more about our artists colours at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.schmincke.de">https://www.schmincke.de</a><br /> Learn more about the artist Dirk Schmitt at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dirk-schmitt.de">https://www.dirk-schmitt.de</a>{% endraw %}
