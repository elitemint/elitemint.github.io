{% raw %}With businesses all wanting their information 'connected', the teams delivering the capability often still do this in an unconnected way, so here is the 3rd of 3 short videos that show how delivery teams can playback requirements with relationships and traceability between the Requirements, the developed Tech Solutions, the Business Process and related end user <br />training / methods material, whilst simplifying the ability for the client to understand the relationships, risks and impacts and visualize what they are getting?<br />Whilst this video was aimed at PLM and Digital Engineering, it should be applicable to any delivery team.<br />Note: Blueworks live is the modelling tool for process in this video, but any Process Modelling (not mapping) application should be capable.{% endraw %}
