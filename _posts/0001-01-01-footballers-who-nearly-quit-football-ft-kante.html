If so, Basically my videos are my own opinions about FIFA and Football. If you're someone who loves playing games and sports then you're at the right place to find all the knowledgeable information. Each video has its own topic which makes it different and provides valuable information such as how good Football Players are in the present or will be in the future‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs why you see every FUT Card with a different Overall Rating compared to the previous year‚Ä¶ either It‚Äôs an Upgrade or a Downgrade. Now, It comes to the most requested content on my channel‚Ä¶ FIFA Confirmed Transfers &amp; Rumours, It is a series which I started since the creation of my channel and now upload it every two days‚Ä¶ because a lot of players move or change their clubs for different reasons. When does the Transfer Window open/closes? Well‚Ä¶ the answer is simple it opens on the 1st of January and closes in Mid-December! That‚Äôs the time when players can be purchased or sold by their clubs. With all that said, my main aim is to share the knowledge/experience that I gained throughout the last 8 years by watching Football, analyzing the weekly matches, news, podcasts, and playing video games like FIFA‚Ä¶ which is the most well-known sports game ever. I hope you can learn something from my daily videos.<br /><br />What type of Videos / Series you can expect? üôÑ<br />You can expect different types of videos/series such as Confirmed Transfers, Player Ratings Upgrades / Downgrades, FIFA History, and sometimes Football Facts.<br /><br />There is one question many people ask me‚Ä¶ ZAN! How do you make your videos? Well‚Ä¶ I watch events, news, documentaries, and podcasts to keep myself up to date and then share my knowledge/experience with you all :)<br /><br />¬Æ All the videos on this channel are made by myself, from A-Z. It takes me 8-10 hours to make a single video. The music I use in my videos is free copyright music, mainly from (NCS) NoCopyrightSounds. I hope you enjoy my original content! ‚ö†Ô∏è<br /><br />PS: Let me know in the comments below if you want to see any other type of videos! üòú{% endraw %}
