{% raw %}We used the Hot Wheels Super 6 Lane Raceway to set up our most challenging track yet. Each car will attempt to complete all 6 lanes. Decide your rides by leaving a comment below. Choose 1 car on card and 1 loose car. If both of your cars complete the track you will get a shout at the end of the event. Let's see who makes it.{% endraw %}
