Clean the barn <br />3. Clean the stones<br />4. Scrub the stones<br />5. Clean the stones again ðŸ˜­<br />6.

We use these funds to feed our cat, who demands an abundance of cat soup (yes thatâ€™s a real thing!)<br /><br />Theo and Bee gave up their busy city lifestyles in 2014 to explore alternative living, and have lived in vans and boats since then without looking back! Along with their cat Ginjey Bear they have been driving around the world in their self converted Sprinter van. However, when the global pandemic hit they began converting their abandoned stone barn in Central Portugal to turn into a wonderful tiny stone cottage. Along the way, they have rescued a playful cat called Furrnando and have a wonderful flock of Chickens!{% endraw %}
