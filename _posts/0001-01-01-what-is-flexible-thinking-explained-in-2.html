Flexible thinking is also referred to as mental flexibility or cognitive flexibility.<br />It's an important skill in this era of rapid change to be sufficiently flexible and be able to adapt to new situations.<br />Itâ€™s quite common that we have to change the way we are doing things like analysing information or using different approaches when solving a problem.<br />But itâ€™s certainly not an easy thing to do, because as humans we get used to doing things in the same way because it requires less effort.<br />If you know that dealing with emails takes you about 1 hour a day then you just accept it as it is without questioning it.<br />The problem is that if you donâ€™t change anything then over time you will be spending more and more time on this activity and that will reduce time you can work on other things.<br />So the key is to shift your mindset and look at things from different perspectives. This would mean asking yourself a question - Why am I getting so many emails?<br />Is there a problem with internal processes in your team and everyone is asking you questions or is there missing information that can be added to your website so people donâ€™t send you emails.<br />Of course, you can figure out how to reply quicker to your emails by having email templates, but itâ€™s even better to stop getting them in the first place.<br />To improve flexible thinking itâ€™s critical that you raise your self-awareness as that will enable you to see the bigger picture and you can practice it by reflecting on your daily activities.<br /><br />I hope that you enjoyed this video and I was able to give you a quick summary of what Flexible Thinking is and why itâ€™s important.     _________________<br /><br />Hi, My name is Janis and Iâ€™m Content Creator and Entrepreneur.<br /><br />One thing that Iâ€™m really passionate about is Time Management.
