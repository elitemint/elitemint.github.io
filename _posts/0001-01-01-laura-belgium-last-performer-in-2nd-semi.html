{% raw %}Laura will represent Belgium at the 2016 Eurovision Song Contest with the song What's The Pressure. She will be the last performer on stage in the second Semi-Final, which she sees an advantage, as she hopes the audience will remember her song, although it means that she has to watch all the other artists go on before her.{% endraw %}
