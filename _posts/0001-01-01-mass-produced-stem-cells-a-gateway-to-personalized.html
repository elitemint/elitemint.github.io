{% raw %}Ronawk T-blocks are disrupting the industry by enabling the production of adult stem cells in large quantities.<br /><br />Ronawk, a Kansas-based bioengineering firm founded by A.J. Mellott, PhD, and Heather Decker, revolutionized stem cell research with the T-block, an innovative hydrogel scaffold that enables the mass production of adult stem cells. The startup’s chief executive officer, Dr. Mellott, says that CELLINK’s renowned team of application scientists supported him from beginning to end, as he perfected his prototype on the BIO X™ all the way to manufacturing it in high throughputs on the Lumen X™.<br /><br />Read more: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cellink.com/customer-spotlight/are-mass-produced-stem-cells-the-gateway-to-personalized-medicine/">https://www.cellink.com/customer-spotlight/are-mass-produced-stem-cells-the-gateway-to-personalized-medicine/</a>{% endraw %}
