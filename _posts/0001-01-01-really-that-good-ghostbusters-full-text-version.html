{% raw %}Full Text-Version Now Available!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://moviebob.blogspot.com/2015/04/really-that-good-ghostbusters-now-with.html">http://moviebob.blogspot.com/2015/04/really-that-good-ghostbusters-now-with.html</a><br /><br />REALLY THAT GOOD is a new kind of film-criticism series, built around the radical premise that just because &quot;everyone knows&quot; a movie is a classic doesn't mean it stops being worth a deeper look.<br /><br />Case in point: Ivan Reitman's GHOSTBUSTERS is one of the most beloved blockbuster comedies of all time, spawning generations of devoted fans and an empire of toys, cartoons, video-games and a even hotly-anticipated reboot next year. Okay, fine - pretty much everybody loves GHOSTBUSTERS... but when was the last time you really thought about just what makes it such an enduring classic?<br /><br />While it's easy to write GHOSTBUSTERS off as yet another amusing but simplistic and/or &quot;shallow&quot; blockbuster elevated to &quot;classic&quot; status by nostalgia-blinded Generation Xers still chugging Ecto-Cooler and polishing their cartoon-inspired action figures; this re-examination argues that the film actually doesn't get enough credit - and aims to prove it with a thorough examination of its unique characters, unconventional screenplay and the surprisingly subversive themes and big ideas you may never have considered were there all along!<br /><br />REALLY THAT GOOD is an independent production of MovieBob.
