{% raw %}&quot;Mad Money&quot; host Jim Cramer on Wednesday ripped what he called &quot;bearish billionaires&quot; who have been negative on the stock market for years.

By contrast, many hourly workers in the U.S. are seeing their wages go up right now, he said.<br /><br />“I think many of the wealthy, wittingly or unwittingly, are pulling up the ladder behind them by scaring you away from the stock market with horror stories about the dangers of inflation lurking everywhere,” Cramer said.<br /><br />Cramer said it goes beyond dire inflation warnings of late.<br /><br />“They’re also scaring you away from some of the best stocks in the market that really don’t have anything to do with inflation at all,” he said, highlighting Tesla, Amazon and Netflix as examples.<br /><br />“Rich and powerful people spent years coming on air and talking trash about all three,” Cramer said, but he contended they’ve become some of the most successful companies of all time.<br /><br />Aside from a few exceptions, Cramer urged retail investors to stop taking their cue from “super-rich money managers.”<br /><br />“Do you think it’s a coincidence that so many hedge fund guys made giant bets against [Tesla, Amazon and Netflix] and lost? I don’t think so,” Cramer said.<br /><br />“The people behind those companies wanted to create wealth for their shareholder; they were willing to take huge risks for you in order to help you get rich long with themselves. If you held their stocks for long , that’s exactly what you did,” he said. “That’s huge for the vast majority of people, but if you’ve already got a billion dollars, it’s meaningless, which is why they have no appreciation for these companies or their evangelical leaders.”<br /><br />» Subscribe to CNBC TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic</a> <br /><br />Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.
