{% raw %}Agriculture accounts for 17 percent of worldwide CO2 emissions. But what if there were a way to produce it without harming the planet? The idea is called permaculture – growing vegetables in a circular, self-sustaining system, without artificial pesticides or fertilizer.<br /><br />We're destroying our environment at an alarming rate. But it doesn't need to be this way. Our new channel Planet A explores the shift towards an eco-friendly world — and challenges our ideas about what dealing with climate change means. We look at the big and the small: What we can do and how the system needs to change. Every Friday we'll take a truly global look at how to get us out of this mess.<br /><br />#PlanetA #Permaculture #SustainableAgriculture<br /><br />Read More:<br /><br />Permaculture methods and principles: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://permacultureprinciples.com/resources/free-downloads/">https://permacultureprinciples.com/resources/free-downloads/</a><br /><br />Scientific evidence for permaculture methods: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/9/3218">https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/9/3218</a><br /><br />Scalability and commercial possibilities for permaculture: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13165-020-00281-8">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13165-020-00281-8</a><br /><br />Permaculture projects worldwide: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://permacultureglobal.org/">https://permacultureglobal.org/</a><br /><br />Special thanks to: Simin Fadaee, Immo Fiebrig, Narsanna Koppula, Julius Reiff and Sabine Zikeli for background interviews. <br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />1:02 Farming the permaculture way<br />2:02 What is permaculture?<br />3:05 Design and water management<br />4:39 Building up the soil<br />5:22 Polyculture, habitats and pesticides<br />7:21 Permaculture worldwide<br />8:04 The future of permaculture<br />10:44 Conclusion<br /><br />Reporter: Kiyo Dörrer<br />Camera &amp; Video Editor: Henning Goll<br />Supervising Editor: Joanna Gottschalk{% endraw %}
