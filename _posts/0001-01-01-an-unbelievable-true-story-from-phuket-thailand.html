{% raw %}To those who have asked if I have a Patreon, I have something WAY BETTER.  Check it out here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://retiredworkingforyou.com/memberships/">https://retiredworkingforyou.com/memberships/</a>   <br /><br />What 5 Star Marine in Phuket, Thailand have done during the past 14 months is nothing short of unbelievable.  This video will tell the story about how, when the pandemic struck, one man decided to begin helping those in need on his home island and as the need grew, so did the effort.  Today, One Phuket has handed out more than 210,000 'Life Bags' with daily essentials for a local family who have no income.  On Phuket, where tourism is basically everything, this has provided a lifeline and gotten many through this challenging year.  <br /><br />The news in Bangkok and Thailand has been mostly bad this past year, but the Phuket Sandbox is reopening travel and bringing hope to the locals who are looking to get back on their feet.  So book a ticket and be a hero!   <br /><br />Here are some links and if you want to donate directly to One Phuket, they would appreciate any help you can give.  <br /><br />One Phuket Donations: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.weeboon.com/en/campaign/help-us-provide-life-bags-for-phuket-">https://www.weeboon.com/en/campaign/help-us-provide-life-bags-for-phuket-</a><br />One Phuket Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/onephuket">https://www.facebook.com/groups/onephuket</a> <br />5 Star Marine: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://5starmarinephuket.com/">https://5starmarinephuket.com/</a> <br />Sutay Muay Thai: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sutaiphuket.com/">https://sutaiphuket.com/</a> <br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />To those who have asked if I have a Patreon, I have something WAY BETTER.
