{% raw %}Common - When We Move | Vevo Ctrl  (Live Session)<br /><br />Declarations of cultural pride don't come much more passionate or engaging than &quot;How We Move.&quot; Common's 'A Beautiful Revolution, Part 2' album teems with big ideas, great grooves, and fierce flows, but this track, which features Black Thought and Seun Kuti, rides a powerhouse rhythm with sizable Afro-Pop influences (yes, Seun is Fela's son). When the rappers jump in, they're carried along by river of propulsion. The Chicago hip-hop icon, who's been a longtime Vevo bud, is at his best here, so goosebumps abound. &quot;Wherever we are you can feel the prowess/Whenever we move, yo, we turn the style up/I'ma just give Black power its flowers/Whether in the projects or the palace.&quot; It was big treat to have the maestro hit our Brooklyn studios and spit this one. Heads up, greatness is in the house. <br /><br />Watch the official video for &quot;When We Move&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/DZQL3EsZztw">https://youtu.be/DZQL3EsZztw</a><br /><br />Watch music videos by Common: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBGDlQIq1hx5nSTIpWTsGAQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBGDlQIq1hx5nSTIpWTsGAQ</a><br /><br />Buy &amp; stream A Beautiful Revolution Pt. 2 out now: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/Common_ABRPart2">https://found.ee/Common_ABRPart2</a> <br />Listen to &quot;Imagine&quot; ft.
