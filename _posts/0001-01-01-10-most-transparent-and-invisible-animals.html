{% raw %}10 Most Transparent And Invisible Animals In The World<br /><br />If you're new, Subscribe! → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/djmfuX">http://goo.gl/djmfuX</a><br /><br /><br />Some animals are known for their bright vibrant colors (peacock) while others are known for their ability to blend in with their surroundings (chameleon), but some blend in in a totally different way... by being completely invisible, this tactic is used by a small handful of species in order to protect themselves against predators and also to be more effective hunters. Transparency in living organisms is almost hard to imagine but it happens and scientists are continually searching every corner of the globe in hopes of better understanding these unique creatures and in hopes of discovering even more.  <br /><br />10. Glasswing Butterfly <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAzbNUX4dUA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAzbNUX4dUA</a><br />This stunning butterfly known as the glasswing, can be found mainly in Central and Northern regions of South America stretching as far north as Texas and as far south as Chile. Despite their name, this butterfly’s wings are far from fragile, in fact, this phenomenal looking creature and carry up to 40 times their own weight, that’s like you or me carrying around 800 pounds! Adding to the harty reputation of this butterfly is the fact that they migrate vast distances and are able to travel as far as 12 miles a day and can reach speeds of 8 miles per hour! Like most butterflies, the glass wing spends a good chunk of its life avoiding predators, mainly birds, in order to combat this threat the glasswings use their transparency to camouflage when flying and have evolved a resistance to toxic plants, this resistance allows them to eat toxic substances that will cause predators to reject them as a food source. <br /><br />9. European eel<br />The European Eel is a type of eel that can grow to upwards of 3 and a half feet long! Unfortunately due to overfishing, parasites, and man-made barriers, the European eel is now listed as critically endangered. For hundreds of years, nearly nothing was known about these creatures, this was largely because they begin their lives in fresh inland water before returning to the ocean to spawn and die, this meant that fisherman and scientists failed to recover young specimens in areas where they had previously found adults, furthermore after a certain age the <br />European eels become silver in color, further confusing early researchers. Another mystery surrounding this creature is that researchers are still having a difficult time establishing a life expectancy for them because captive species have reached the age of 80 and anecdotal evidence from Sweden suggests that a single specimen may have lived 155 years in a family’s well.<br /><br />8. Reticulated Glass Frog<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7zARByAu1c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7zARByAu1c</a><br />This creature isn’t in fact fully transparent but it definitely qualifies for our list! Glass frogs live mainly in trees along rivers and streams where they blend in quite easily, afterall they aren’t exactly giant, with the average specimen being between 1 and a half and 3 inches in length. But probably the most captivating aspect of these frogs is that their abdominal skin is transparent making their heart, lungs, and digestive tract fully visible, while this sight may make some folks a bit squeamish it is undeniably incredible to watch the organs of a living creature function in real-time. If you want one of these majestic creatures living in your home, you can own one for about $149.99 American dollars.<br /><br /><br />Top 5 Best is the #1 place for all your heart warming stories about amazing people that will inspire you everyday.

Some of the larger species live in polar waters and can reach upwards of 5 cm, despite their tiny size, they are carnivorous beings that grasp prey with tentacles or suckers, but their specific hunting tactics are highly variable with some populations, laying in wait and ambushing their target, while others actively pursue their prey. As for getting around, these tiny creatures have fins that look similar to wings and have earned them the nickname of sea butterflies, they use these wings to paddle themselves at speeds up to 100 millimeters per second, which, even though that’s only about 0.22 mph, is an impressive speed for these little fellows!<br /><br />family friendly pg clean<br /><br />#viralstory #amazingpeople #top5best{% endraw %}
