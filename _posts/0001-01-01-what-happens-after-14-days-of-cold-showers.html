His use of “doctor” or “Dr.” in relation to himself solely refers to that degree.  Dr. Berg is a licensed chiropractor in Virginia, California, and Louisiana, but he no longer practices chiropractic in any state and does not see patients so he can focus on educating people as a full time activity, yet he maintains an active license.

It should not be used to self-diagnose and it is not a substitute for a medical exam, cure, treatment, diagnosis, and prescription or recommendation.  It does not create a doctor-patient relationship between Dr. Berg and you.  You should not make any change in your health regimen or diet before first consulting a physician and obtaining a medical exam, diagnosis, and recommendation.  Always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. <br /><br />#keto #ketodiet #weightloss #ketolifestyle<br /><br />Thanks for watching.
