Here is one of the most common questions I get asked. I've also asked this question before I started learning how to fly. The simple answer is YES! you can start on your pilot journey even if you don't naturally have 20/20 vision. The FAA states that  those allowed to legally fly are required to have 20/20 distance view with or without correctional lenses. The keywords being with or without.<br /><br />So if you don't naturally have 20/20 vision you can get prescription glasses or contact lenses that allows you to see 20/20 and with that you can wear those correctional lenses to fly. My personal journey has been the same. I'd been wearing correctional lenses for almost 2 decades and I recently had eye lasik surgery.<br /><br />I will make a video update on my experience so far with lasik and how it has affected my flying.<br /><br />My Airplane Specs<br />- 2021 Sling TSi<br />- Rotax 915 (141 hp engine)<br />- Range: up to 1000 miles<br />- Climb rate: 1200 fpm<br />- Speed: 170 mph<br />- Fuel: 8 gph<br />- Dual G3x + G5 Backup + GTN 650 + GMC 507 Autopilot<br />- Build Price + Training: $325,000<br />Buy one at LookUp Aviation <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.lookupaviation.com">https://www.lookupaviation.com</a><br /><br />Start your aviation journey here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pilotarm.com/aviator-signup/​​">https://pilotarm.com/aviator-signup/​​</a><br /><br />Manage your aircraft with COFLYT <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://coflyt.com/mojogrip">https://coflyt.com/mojogrip</a><br /><br />My Merch <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bonfire.com/store/mojogrip/">https://www.bonfire.com/store/mojogrip/</a>{% endraw %}
