{% raw %}Learn how to get a girl to chase you and increase attraction with a woman by ignoring her. In today's video we're going to be discussing the truth behind ignoring a girl, the right and wrong way this can be done and how it actually works to make a girl chase you.<br /><br />Is it possible to get a girl to like you more and even chase you by ignoring her? Seems kind of backwards doesn't it? Why would you even ignore her, because she could think you are rude and move on. But these are all risks, but if you do it correctly then you would only actually increase how much she likes you, and you might find that she starts to chase you. You'll become the most wanted guy on her list and she'll push any other guy she's seen to the side so she can focus on you. So it is worth mentioning that we are not talking about ignoring a girl, we don't mean manipulating her either. Girls do not want to date guys who are playing games with them, as soon as they spot this they are going to run away, run backwards to a thousand miles. Now you don't want this, the end game is to win her over. So don't play games, just be strategic and protect yourself a little instead of diving in head first. Always be nice, kind and polite to the girl. <br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />1:00 How to get a girl to chase you &amp; increase attraction by ignoring her<br />1:07 You make the first move<br />1:37 Don't give her everything at the beginning<br />2:20 Don't change your plans for her<br />3:02 Ignore her when she tries to make you jealous<br />3:44 Ignore her if she starts acting disinterested<br />4:26 Delay replying to her texts<br />5:05 Ignore her in public and let her come to you<br />5:52 If she becomes angry ignore her and reassess<br />6:35 Be busy and have your own life<br /><br />🥰🥰🥰Join the Joyanima channel as a member: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2oNJv2Tc3ctbJB0JoQ130w/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2oNJv2Tc3ctbJB0JoQ130w/join</a><br /><br />Benefits include:<br />😀Loyalty badges - show your support<br />😀Emojis<br />😀Access member only high engagement community posts - discuss future videos and more!<br />😀Behind the scenes bits and pieces<br /><br />💌What did you think of today's video?
