{% raw %}There are all types of RC enthusiasts from those who like to pick up a kit and tons of accessories to build their dream RC. And there are those who would rather pull the RC from the box and get right to having fun. For those that just want to skip to fun, it also means skipping out on the accessories at first. But that is about to change with the new Rebel RC RJ Rebelcon RC Crawler. Rebel RC is a new brand and they have the same philosophy as their parent company Rebel Off-Road of making it easy for people to go have fun with fully built up rigs. The new Rebelcon comes ready to run, painted and detailed with lots of accessories down to a full LED light package. But it’s not just show stuff, under the hood is an impressive chassis fitted with a two-speed transmission, portal axles, aluminum suspension parts and much more. We got our hands on one the day before the release and stayed up late to bring you a first look at this new rig. Rebel RC will certainly be a company to watch in the future.<br /><br />PRODUCT FEATURED<br />RJ Rebelcon RC Crawler <br />Distributed By: Rebel RC <br />Type: 1/10 Electric 4WD RC Crawler<br />Part Number: NA<br />Price: $459.99<br />Visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rebel-rc.com/rj-rebelcon-graphite-1-10-rtr/">https://rebel-rc.com/rj-rebelcon-graphite-1-10-rtr/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rebel-rc.com/rj-rebelcon-orange-1-10-rtr/">https://rebel-rc.com/rj-rebelcon-orange-1-10-rtr/</a><br /><br />SHOP FOR RC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://snp.link/dafbfff4">https://snp.link/dafbfff4</a><br />RC DRIVER SHIRTS &amp; MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/rc-driver-swag-store">https://teespring.com/stores/rc-driver-swag-store</a><br />WORKSHOP STORAGE RACKS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3xNgwZj">https://bit.ly/3xNgwZj</a><br /><br />Don’t Miss A Thing!
