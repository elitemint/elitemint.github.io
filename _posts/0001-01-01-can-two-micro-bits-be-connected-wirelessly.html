{% raw %}Step by step tutorial for building a Micro:bit car and programming it for Remote Control with Micro:bit radio. On every platform the system is pretty much the same. Find out the pins for the motor and send the required motor power to them. Although in general I much prefer LEGO over soldering and screwing with Micro:bit, the little board has got it's charm. It's cheap and versatile.<br /><br />Music: www.bensound.com{% endraw %}
