{% raw %}Today we look at #Salesforce #CRM #Stock - the company just reported Q3 earnings. This company reminds me of fine dining - always delivers … but leaves me wanting more. The company is only marginally profitable, and for a company with a $270B+ valuation and relatively strong growth rates, it’s not super exciting. <br /><br />A new Co-CEO was announced, potentially signally the end of Marc Benioff. While, I’m not anticipating this - we do go over a scenario why he might want to leave sooner rather than later. <br /><br />— Follow Me On Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/investorvideos/">https://www.instagram.com/investorvideos/</a><br />— Follow Me On Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/investorvideos">https://twitter.com/investorvideos</a><br /><br />WANT TO HELP THE CHANNEL???
