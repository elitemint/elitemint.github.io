{% raw %}Tulare County decided to cut down this giant sequoia located in Alder Creek Grove after it was reported to still be on fire (from the 2020 SQF Complex / Castle Fire). The big tree was approximately 14 feet in diameter above its huge burls. It took 10 hours of constant work over 2 days for the hired crew to cut it down.{% endraw %}
