{% raw %}Hello my darlins!<br />Today I am back to my recycling addiction.  I had a ton of junk mail envelopes, sitting around doing nothing.  I also had a ton of pretty paper scraps crying out to be used. They were a match made in heaven!   I am looking forward to giving these envelopes out to my friends and family.  I hope you find the process useful.  I really enjoyed making them.<br />Thank you so much for watching<br />Mucho Love <br />Jane :) xxxxxx{% endraw %}
