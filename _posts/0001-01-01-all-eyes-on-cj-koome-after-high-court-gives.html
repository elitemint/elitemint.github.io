{% raw %}All eyes are now on Chief Justice Martha Koome after the high court gave her a leeway to appoint the six judges rejected by President Uhuru Kenyatta if the head of state does not appoint them by the 4th of November. Senior Political Affairs Reporter Geff Kirui interrogates why the ruling by the court is a major test that puts Cj Koome between a rock and a hard place, to uphold the rule of law and swear in the 6 judges and risk aggravating the frosty relationship between the judiciary and executive or act otherwise and be branded a Trojan horse in the quest for the independence of the judiciary.<br /><br />#Trending #KTNNews #KTNPrime <br /><br /><br />Watch Breaking and the latest news happening in Kenya, Africa and across the globe in real-time.
