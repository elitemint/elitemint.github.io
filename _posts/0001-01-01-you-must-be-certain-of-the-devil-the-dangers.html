{% raw %}A video I made in 1988 about global conglomerates, surveillance, and our food and habits becoming hypnotised crap. With a bit of religion chucked in for good measure. Seems especially pertinent *right now*, as Diamanda Galas (inadvertently?) points out in the soundtrack. The lyrics are *everything*. The editing is remastered (original film got deleted, but amazingly, I recently found the footage from which it was made), and is a tad clunky, but hopefully it gets the points across. x<br /><br />MUSIC -- You Must Be Certain of the Devil by Diamanda Gala{% endraw %}
