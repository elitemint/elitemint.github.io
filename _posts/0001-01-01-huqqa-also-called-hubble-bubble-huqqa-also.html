{% raw %}Huqqa - Also called hubble-bubble - A pipe traditionally used for smoking flavored tobacco in which tobacco is placed in a bowl and heated with burning charcoal, producing smoke that is drawn through an urn of water that cools it and then into a long tube with an attached mouthpiece. In some modern versions, the charcoal-heated bowl is replaced with a battery-powered vaporizer containing a liquid mixture similar to that used in an e-cigarette. Also called hubble-bubble, narghile, shisha.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/1ACfnvoJG68">https://youtu.be/1ACfnvoJG68</a>{% endraw %}
