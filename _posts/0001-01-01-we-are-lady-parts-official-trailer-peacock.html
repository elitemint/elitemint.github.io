However, the other members – taxi-driving drummer Ayesha (Juliette Motamed), cartoon-drawing bassist and backing vocalist Bisma (Faith Omole) and the band’s wheeler-dealer band manager Momtaz (Lucie Shorthouse) – are not convinced she is right for their band. <br /><br />Amina has never met girls like this before, and she’s soon swept up in their joyful, anarchic energy and punk spirit. But she becomes torn and caught up between two different worlds – that of her more strait-laced university friends led by her bestie Noor and the world of Lady Parts. Will she be the key to the band’s success? And - will she finally find a husband?<br /><br />Synopsis: &quot;We Are Lady Parts&quot; is an anarchic and irreverent music comedy following a Muslim female punk band – called Lady Parts – who are on a mission to find a lead guitarist and maybe, just maybe, get a proper gig.
