{% raw %}It was supposed to be a short vlog, i just wanted to show how we make fruit cake, explain why we only make it every second year, that it was our Thursday dessert for this week which also means that its our (my partner and i) bake week but, here we are with a 20 minute vlog to be honest i didn't expect it but, i love talking and sharing with you so and it never felt like i was creating a long vlog.<br />#Hutterite #weekinmylife<br /><br />link to the candles and salves:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mikellyfarms.com">https://www.mikellyfarms.com</a>{% endraw %}
