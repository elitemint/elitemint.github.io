{% raw %}▶️ I felt like making a knife with an epoxy resin handle again.<br />But it should also be something special.<br />So I took small, dry birch twigs and poured resin over them.<br /><br />I was absolutely surprised by the result. No air bubbles and absolutely stable in terms of handling.<br />As always, reworking is very time-consuming with epoxy resin.<br />Still, it's worth it.<br /><br />Sanding with very fine sandpaper, up to 5000 grit, is a must...and good arm training ^^<br /><br />Steel is a remnant of 1.2510 (O1 steel) that I still had and before it started rusting, I made a knife out of it.<br /><br />The heat treatment was a complete success. File test positive. <br />Subsequent tempering was just as effective.<br /><br />The final hardness that can be achieved with O1 steel is between 61 and 63 HRC.<br /><br />🔶 The sharpness of the knife has become incredible 🏋🏽<br />Can be seen in the video.<br /><br />I polished the knife but no mirror polish. I like that a lot and it fits well.<br /><br />🔶 By the way, you can now also follow me on Instagram. Still totally fresh but the content will follow.<br /><br />🔶 Thank you and like and subscribe. That helps me in the long term and I welcome that very much.<br /><br />Thank you, cheers and stay safe{% endraw %}
