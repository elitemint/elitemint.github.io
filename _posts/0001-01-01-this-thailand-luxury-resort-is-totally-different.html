{% raw %}Today we check in to a luxury camping tent resort in Thailand and checkout all the amenities.  Our luxury camping Tent has a jacuzzi tub, hardwood floor and deluxe king size bed.  I never knew this existed in Thailand but I was pleasantly surprised.  We also enjoy some nice vistas and scenery as we continue our latest travel series.  Enjoy the Ride!<br /><br />Follow the facebook fan page for exclusive updates:<br />www.facebook.com/Rides4Kickz<br /><br />#Thailand #ThailandLuxury #Rides4Kickz{% endraw %}
