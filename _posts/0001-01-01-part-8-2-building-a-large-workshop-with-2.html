{% raw %}In the final episode of Building a large workshop with only 2 guys, We finally finish our part.  A couple things to not is the installation of perforated steel on the upper section of our walls.  This will help dramatically reduce echo in the building.  We use a black thin plastic to reduce seeing the interior wall thru those perforations...don't worry its not a vapor barrier.  Once concrete is poured and doors are installed I will have to come back and show you all the finished building.  <br /><br />Make sure you hit that subscribe button to follow along as we start a pretty epic barndominium next.  <br /><br />Building Plans available here!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rrplans.bigcartel.com/">https://rrplans.bigcartel.com/</a><br /><br />Top Tool List<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://imp.i284638.net/orPQm">https://imp.i284638.net/orPQm</a><br /><br />Shirts<br />www.rrbuildings.bigcartel.com <br /><br />Hearing Protection - ISOtunes<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2PoXSBw">http://bit.ly/2PoXSBw</a>{% endraw %}
