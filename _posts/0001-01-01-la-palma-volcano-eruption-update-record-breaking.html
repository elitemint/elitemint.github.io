{% raw %}The La Palma / Cumbre Vieja eruption is now in its 84th day. As a result, it is now the longest eruption to ever occur from this volcano! It just surpasses the length of the 1585 eruption, which lasted for 83 days. While lava flows have continued at the Guirres Beach, yellow sulfur crystals have once again become visible on the main cinder cone. More lava flows are expected in the upcoming days, which will continue to expand the existing large lava field. This video will discuss what is likely to happen next as this Spanish Canary Island volcano. <br /><br />Social media link(s) of a scientific organization which can provide more up to date information:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.involcan.org/">http://www.involcan.org/</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/INVOLCAN">https://www.facebook.com/INVOLCAN</a>   <br /><br />Special Thanks: TV Canarias, INVOLCAN, VolcanoDiscovery<br /><br />If you would like to support this channel, consider becoming a patron at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/geologyhub.">http://patreon.com/geologyhub.</a><br /><br />Another way to support this channel is to make an order via our gemstone and geology related etsy store at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://prospectingarizona.etsy.com.">http://prospectingarizona.etsy.com.</a>{% endraw %}
