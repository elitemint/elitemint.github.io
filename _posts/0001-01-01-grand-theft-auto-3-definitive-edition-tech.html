{% raw %}There's been a wave of controversy surrounding GTA: The Definitive Edition. We'll be looking at all three of the games in the pack but we wanted to begin with GTA3 - the title that stands to improve the most via remastering and the genuine 'granddaddy' of today's open world games. In this video, we check out every current-gen and last-gen console version of the game, and stack up the best of the bunch to the PS2 original.<br /><br />Join the DF Patreon for pristine video downloads, behind the scenes content, early access to DF Retro, early access to DF Direct Weekly and much, much more: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3jEGjvx">https://bit.ly/3jEGjvx</a><br /><br />Subscribe for more Digital Foundry: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/DFSubscribe">http://bit.ly/DFSubscribe</a><br /><br />Want some DF-branded tee-shirts, mugs, hoodies or pullovers?
