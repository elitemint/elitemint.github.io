The issue was twofold:<br /><br />- I had leads from a few different places that needed to be brought into FluentCRM. Some of those emails were old and I had to figure out which.<br />- I was going to begin sending emails using AmazonSES and I didn't want my first few emails to be sent out to bad email addresses as this could really hurt my sender reputation and my account health with Amazon.<br /><br />So, I had to do a few things to ensure a good experience as I switched email platforms.<br /><br />I needed to clean the list as best I could.<br /><br />And I needed to &quot;break in&quot; a new email platform to begin sending emails without hurting anything.
