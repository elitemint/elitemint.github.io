{% raw %}BEING SPECIFIC! One of the most ignored acting tools.  Acting Tips With Peter Kalos<br /><br />Many actors take this skill for granted- SPECIFIC, SPECIFIC, SPECIFIC! I can’t say it enough- SPECIFIC!<br /><br />What we mean by that is everything- which cup? How do you sit? Why this table? Why this restaurant? Why this jacket? The choices go on and on- you do this in everyday life without giving it much thought, you reach out to grab a pair of socks and based on where you’re going- you pick one for that reason, you get on a train- you don’t just sit anywhere, you scan around and make a specific chair for a reason.  You go to a restaurant, you pick a table… depends on the reason- if it’s a romantic date, it’s different from a friend with drinks. What you have to do now as an actor is take this skill and apply it to everything in the scene,  KEEPING THE CHARACTER IN MIND- and make objects “personal” by connection them to people that matter to you.<br /><br />MASSIVE skill and many actors don’t do because they only focus on the lines.<br /><br />This changes everything!<br /><br /><br />Hey Actors, Thank you for watching, please consider subscribing, sharing, enjoying and above all DO THE WORK!<br /><br />Thumbnail Thanks to: Background photo created by freepik - www.freepik.com<br /><br />#peterkalos #melbourneactorslab #method2.0{% endraw %}
