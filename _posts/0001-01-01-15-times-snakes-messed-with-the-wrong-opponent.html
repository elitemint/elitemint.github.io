{% raw %}Snakes have the unique niche role of being both the predator and the prey in the wild. On one hand, they help control pest populations. They also act as ‘ecosystem engineers.’ Rodents eat plant seeds, then snakes eat the rodents. This makes snakes secondary seed dispersers, helping plants find new places to grow. On the other hand, snakes make for a healthy snack for some animals, even poisonous ones. They do experience other unexpected challenges from all sorts of unexpected creatures, like spiders, badgers, birds, and even people. These animal enemies put up a good fight. 15 Times Snakes Messed With The Wrong Opponent #2<br /><br />For Copyright Issues, Please Feel Free to E-mail me: <br />TSindustries32@hotmail.com{% endraw %}
