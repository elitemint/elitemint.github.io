{% raw %}The world is changing at an increasingly fast pace: there are now multiple media voices (tv channels, social media, etc.). New parties appear and disappear. The electorate is becoming ever more volatile. What does it take to win an election in this new environment? In this talk, Dr. Louis Perron argues that it takes the four “M”s to win election campaigns in these new surroundings: message, media, money and make no mistakes. He also invites people to get engaged in campaigns as campaigning has never been more worthwhile then now. <br /><br />Dr. Louis Perron is a political scientist and consultant based in Switzerland. During the past years, he has won more than two dozen competitive election campaigns in various countries. His clients include everything from mayors up to senators, members of cabinet and presidents. He is the author of the book “How to Overcome the Power of Incumbency in Election Campaigns”. Earlier in his career, Louis earned a M.A. in political management at the George Washington University in Washington D.C. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
