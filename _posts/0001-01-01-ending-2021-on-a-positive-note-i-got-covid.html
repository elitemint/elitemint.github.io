{% raw %}ending 2021 on a positive note... i got covid <br /><br />So... I got covid. I can't even begin to describe how I felt when I got the text from the department of health. SO WEIRD. <br /><br />In October 2021, restrictions eased in Victoria, Australia, which meant that although vaccination rates are extremely high, we'd still be seeing cases of covid. The numbers have stayed at aroud the 1000-2000 mark but these last few days (due to the Omicron variant) they have climbed to the 5000's. I was one of the unlucky ones who got it over the new year period! So I'll be home for that (And I'll be getting ready and having a little party by myself hehe)<br /><br />Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. Although  a few days ago I did have very mild symptoms, which I never registered as COVID symptoms. I'm thankful to be double vaccinated with Pfizer, because if I weren't things would have looked a lot different. Stay safe and well my lovesss ‚ù§Ô∏è<br /><br />Catch up on my recent videos:<br /><br />1.
