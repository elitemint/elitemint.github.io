{% raw %}The photograph analyzed here (PSP_001415_1875) was acquired by NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on 14 November 2006 and is described as ‘Alluvial Fans in Mojave Crater: Did It Rain on Mars?.’<br /><br />Here I feature an anomaly I discovered at a new site in in Mojave in the region Hydaspis Chaos. Two sets of two tracks can be seen, one set of tracks are parallel and the other set of tracks follows the same arc. If these are boulders that rolled down the slope why don't they all four follows the same trajectory, after all they have the same origin points? There is symmetry and geometry at play here again.<br /><br />As always, until we get to see these anomalies up close and personal, I can only speculate as to what these objects might be.<br /><br />My Blog Post featuring: 'Virtually identical Tracks Discovered in Mojave on Mars:'<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://mars.raptorzone.co.za/2021/11/20/virtually-identical-tracks-discovered-in-mojave-on-mars/">http://mars.raptorzone.co.za/2021/11/20/virtually-identical-tracks-discovered-in-mojave-on-mars/</a><br /><br />Original NASA Source:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.uahirise.org/PSP_001415_1875">https://www.uahirise.org/PSP_001415_1875</a><br /><br />My previous Blog and video featuring this anomaly and others in the same photograph I didn't cover here:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mars.raptorzone.co.za/2018/04/09/massive-structures-and-small-craft-found-on-mars/">https://mars.raptorzone.co.za/2018/04/09/massive-structures-and-small-craft-found-on-mars/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRh7dUWU030">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRh7dUWU030</a><br /><br />Please comment below and let me know what you think.<br /><br />Contributions (PayPal):<br /><br />Your contribution, no matter how small, will help me to cover my Internet fees which include broadband access and hosting of my Blog.
