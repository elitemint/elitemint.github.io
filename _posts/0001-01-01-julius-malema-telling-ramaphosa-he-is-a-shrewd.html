{% raw %}EFF Julius Malema telling Ciryl Ramaphosa exactly what the State of the Nation is. <br />Debate on President’s SONA Address in Parliament. *****<br />The Constitution affords all South Africans the right to see and hear what happens in Parliament.<br />For the last 7 years and for the benefit of subscribers and the community “My Africa” search for sequences that are newsworthy, interesting, funny etc. From a, sometimes long and boring, Parliament sitting allowing the community the opportunity to choose which sequence they find interesting and want to watch.<br />As a result “My Africa” adds significant value to those effected by the exceptionally high cost of Data and Pay TV.<br />Also “My Africa” allows the community to comment and contribute to discussions in a meaningful manner and take stories forward.<br />However, we will NOT condone the following:<br />- Racism (including offensive comments based on ethnicity and nationality)<br />- Sexism<br />- Homophobia<br />- Religious intolerance<br />- Cyber bullying<br />- Hate speech<br />- Derogatory language<br />- Comments inciting violence.<br />We strive to make the YouTube community a safe and welcoming space for all.{% endraw %}
