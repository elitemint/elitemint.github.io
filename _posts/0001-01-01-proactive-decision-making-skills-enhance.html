{% raw %}There is good news, especially for those who teach or participate in #decision-makingcourses and those who want to have a better life. We have gathered empirical evidence suggesting that, firstly, good, proactive# decision-makingskills can be trained and, secondly, these skills explain a substantial share of the variance of #lifesatisfaction. Taken together, by participating in #decision-makingcourses actively, you can learn how to make better decisions, and as a consequence, you are more satisfied with your life.<br /><br /><br />In this video, I summarize latest research results and their theoretical foundation. <br /><br /><br /><br />Siebert JU; Kunz R 2015.
