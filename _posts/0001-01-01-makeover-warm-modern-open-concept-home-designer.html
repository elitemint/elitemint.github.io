{% raw %}Designer Charlie Coull created a serene, open-concept Toronto home with a soft, neutral palette and plenty of natural light. In the living area, she refaced the fireplace with honed black marble and flanked it with new built-in arches and open shelving. Near the hutch that serves as a bar area, a gallery wall full of black and white family photos is always a conversation starter.<br /><br />Presented by Scotties <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://scotties.ca/">https://scotties.ca/</a><br /><br />Design, Charlie Coull Design, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.charliecoulldesign.com/">https://www.charliecoulldesign.com/</a><br />Builder, Catlin Inc.
