This is a funny skit and comedy video! In this skit making fun of teachers and teachers' relatable and awkward moments, RYANcomedy acts &quot;Teachers When they accidentally swear in class&quot; and what happens when teachers swear and how awkward it is for teachers when the accidentally swear or make a mistake! This is not a DIY tutorial or a tommyinnit minecraft gaming videos or tubbo or mr beast $10,000 challenges last to leave in real life how-to videos! No... this video is even funnier.... it is a comedy skit around the idea of teachers and awkward school moments and what it's like being a student and those types of people be like! Other RYANcomedy videos include &quot;no one ads&quot; by RYANcomedy or &quot;the first person to drink sparkling water&quot; or &quot;no one aveeno ads&quot; , &quot;no one perfume ads&quot;, &quot;no one simply piano ads&quot; (where we make an ads parody of cheesy commercials!) Thanks for watching this funny video in 2021!{% endraw %}
