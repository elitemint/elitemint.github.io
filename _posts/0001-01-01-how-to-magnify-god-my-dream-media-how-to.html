{% raw %}HOW TO MAGNIFY GOD||MY DREAM MEDIA.God lets the sun shine for us, gives rain, gives prosperity to sowing and reaping - and you receive and receive. Where is your gratitude? (The ten commandments in Exodus 20: 2) You know the rules of God. (Romans 1:21) Do you really abide in them? You blaspheme not, kill nobody, cheat not, do not steal, do not commit adultery, you honor your parents, have no desire for your neighbor`s holidays, car, house, or partner? You donÂ´t know envy, strife or sinful thoughts? You do everything to take away the distress, anxiety and despair from others? (James 4:17) You are living like Jesus, the Son of God, quite without sin?{% endraw %}
