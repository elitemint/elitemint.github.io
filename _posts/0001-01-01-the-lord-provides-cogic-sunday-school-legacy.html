{% raw %}The Lord Provides<br />Lesson Text: Genesis 22:1-2;6-14 <br />This lesson emphasizes the faith and obedience of Abraham. Although, God promised to give Abraham: 1) a land, 2) a great name, 3) a great nation, and 4) a blessing that would spread to the whole world. Yet, faith and obedience work together. Abraham’s faith in God exercises his obedience to God’s Word, as demonstrated in his willingness to sacrifice his promised child, Isaac.  <br /><br />Thought to remember: God will provide when we obey. <br /><br />Lesson Learned: Abraham’s relationship with God leads to faith and obedience to His Word. Like a child who must have faith in his parents with obedience toward their guidance to achieve maturity. It is no difference in God’s Kingdom because obedience is the evidence of faith. Remember, faith without works is dead. (James 2:26) <br /><br />My Prayer: Dearest Heavenly Father, we thank You for the tests. However, don’t allow our tests to lead us toward the temptation of the Evil One. Enable us to remember that our test empowers us to become fully mature for our Kingdom. In Jesus’ Name, we pray. Amen!<br /><br />Follow the COGIC Legacy Version in God’s Covenant Series from this website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.beyondtheotherside.me/god-covenant">https://www.beyondtheotherside.me/god-covenant</a><br />Follow me on Sound Cloud <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/mickeywbaker">https://soundcloud.com/mickeywbaker</a> <br />You can access my blog. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.beyondtheotherside.me/">https://www.beyondtheotherside.me/</a>{% endraw %}
