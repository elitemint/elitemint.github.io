{% raw %}Ready to isolate, activate and engage the entire glutes and core? 3 minute complexes to increase the reps yet allow for you to really perform at the best pace for you to connect with the muscles and to continually think about your positioning throughout! <br /><br />Each complex is 3 minutes duration with 30 seconds rest inbetween! <br /><br />For this glute &amp; core workout you will need a pair of dumbbells, your mat, a glute band and a chair for hip thrusts! <br /><br />The dumbbell I am using for the hip thrusts and sumo squats is 25kg. I am also using 1 x 15kg for everything else! <br /><br />BANDED STEP OUT (one side) x10<br />SWITCH SIDE!<br /><br />SUMO SQUAT x15<br />1/2 REP BODYWEIGHT x15<br /><br />SUMO DEADLIFT x15<br />BODYWEIGHT SUMO TO RDL x15<br /><br />HIP THRUST (toes up at bottom) x10<br />1/2 REPS x20<br /><br />STAGGERED RDL x15<br />BALANCING BODYWEIGHT RDL x10*<br /><br />STAGGERED RDL x15<br />BALANCING BODYWEIGHT RDL x10<br /><br />FORWARD LEAN LUNGE x15<br />REAR FOOT LIFT LUNGE x15<br /><br />FORWARD LEAN LUNGE x15<br />REAR FOOT LIFT LUNGE x15<br /><br />ALTERNATING DEADBUG x10<br />DOUBLE DEADBUG x10<br /><br />FLAT TO HOLLOW x10<br />REVERSE CRUNCH x29<br /><br />PLANK TWIST x20<br />PLANK ROLLS x20<br /><br />Finisher:<br /><br />SUMO DEADLIFT 1/2 REPS BURN OUT!!!<br /><br />I REALLY felt every single rep in this session! By the time I reached the hip thrusts, my glutes are fully ready and it was intense! <br /><br /> • During the balancing RDLs, don’t worry about the back leg being lifted! Focus on lowering down with a FLAT back, push the chest out, keep slight bend at knee and aim to feel that stretch in the hamstring of leg on floor! <br /> • During the core focused exercises, please tailor these exercises to suit you. Only lower to where you can maintain that lower back pressing into the mat. If you try to lower too far and lower back rises off the mat, you will not be targeting the core and intact aggravating the lower back. The key is to maintain the control of the core in order to progress so over time you can lower that bit further. <br /><br />I absolutely loved this workout as I do most of the glute sessions!! I really embrace that burn and feel the muscles really alight! <br /><br />I hope you smash it too!!<br /><br />Cx<br /><br />Always ensure you warm up before any workout.
