{% raw %}This is the BIGGEST MISTAKE that students make when writing their paragraph or essay! So watch this video to find out how to avoid it!<br /><br />In this video, I cover the purpose of explanation and elaboration in your paragraph. When you use rhetorical questions, you need to explain. When there is an important keyword or idea, you need to elaborate. Before you state a quote, explain the credibility of the author. After your quote, elaborate on what it means!<br /><br />It is safe to say, elaborate and explain your writing. Never assume! I hope this helps you explain your claim and elaborate on your reasoning in your essay!<br /><br />0:00 Introduction to Explaining Your Ideas<br />0:36 Purpose of Explaining Your Ideas<br />1:50 What to Write in Your Paragraph<br />2:10 Explain a Rhetorical Question<br />2:55 Explain and Define Keywords in Writing<br />3:45 How to Explain Source or Quote<br />4:27 How to Explain Ideas in Paragraph<br />5:27 Questions to Ask Yourself<br />5:45 Review, Revise and Edit Paragraph<br /><br />ðŸ”´ Subscribe for more tips just like this: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/y86r2nhd">https://tinyurl.com/y86r2nhd</a><br />ðŸš€ ðŸ“–  Rocketbook Shop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/yxrwh4vp">https://tinyurl.com/yxrwh4vp</a><br />ðŸš€ ðŸ“–  Rocketbook on Amazon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3bUT95J">https://amzn.to/3bUT95J</a><br />ðŸ”¤  Sign up for Grammarly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://grammarly.go2cloud.org/SH2Wh">https://grammarly.go2cloud.org/SH2Wh</a><br /><br />ðŸŽ¬Watch to learn how to Brainstorm Essay Topic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaPW6cAjzkA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaPW6cAjzkA</a><br />ðŸŽ¬Watch to write a Thesis Statement: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Nq65iQwOYOo">https://youtu.be/Nq65iQwOYOo</a><br />ðŸŽ¬Watch to organize an Introduction Paragraph: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Y8uZYPczUU4">https://youtu.be/Y8uZYPczUU4</a><br /><br />Whether you are a teacher trying to help ALL your students navigate the writing process, a parent struggling at home to help their child with distance learning or a student that just got a massive essay in class, this channel is for you!
