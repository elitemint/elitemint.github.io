{% raw %}The CreamCol technology has opened the door to a whole new and novel way to consuming alcohol which fits perfectly into the fast-growing RTD alcohol product sector, bringing a new concept to the industry, RTE or as we said above - Ready To Eat alcohol products.<br /><br />For restaurants, bakeries, hotels, and entertainment venues, the packaging will be a bulk type packaging in pint or quart buckets, which allows the local chefs to conjure up their own unique combinations using the creams in cakes, or as fillings in donuts, eclairs and in other desserts.  <br /><br />Please visit our web site at www.creamcol.com{% endraw %}
