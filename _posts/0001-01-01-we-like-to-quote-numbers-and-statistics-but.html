{% raw %}So often we quote numbers and statistics, but do these numbers really mean what we think they mean? Ryan Eleveld uses Bayes Theorem to enlighten us and encourage us to think critically and put numbers in their proper context. Ryan Eleveld is patently delighted to finally speak at TEDxLFHS! As a member of Tech Crew, TEDx is one of his favourite events of the year. During his waking hours, Ryan enjoys (secretly) writing, solving math problems, learning science...and (mostly) plotting world domination. As a lifelong learner &amp; educator, you might've seen Ryan squirreled away in the Commons figuring out how to do something for Science Olympiad, or moonlighting as a Math &amp; Science TA. Ryan is excited to share some of the finer points of math, and hopefully impart some of his love for it along the way. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
