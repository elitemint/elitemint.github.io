{% raw %}Being Constituted with the Truth for the Consummation of the Divine Economy (1)<br />Scripture Reading: John 8:12, 32; 1 John 1:5-8<br /><br />I. God’s intention in His economy is to dispense Christ with all His riches into His believers chosen by God for the constitution of the Body of Christ, the church, to express the processed and consummated Triune God—Eph. 3:8-10.<br /><br />II. For the consummation of the divine economy, we need to be constituted with the truth—1 John 2:4; 2 John 1-2:<br /><br />A. To be constituted with the truth is to have the intrinsic element of the divine revelation wrought<br />into us to become our constituent, our intrinsic being, our organic constitution—1 John 1:8; 4:6;<br />5:6.<br /><br />B. The solid truth that is constituted into us becomes in us a constant and long-term nourishment—1<br />Tim. 4:6.<br /><br />C. If the truth is wrought into us and constituted into our being, we will be able to protect the<br />interests of the riches of God’s divinity and the attainments of His consummation—Rev. 21:12a, 17.{% endraw %}
