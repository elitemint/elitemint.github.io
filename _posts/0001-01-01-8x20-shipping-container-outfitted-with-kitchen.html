This could be easily prefabricated and shipped virtually anywhere around the world.  It could be used to upgrade housing stock in many locations. It could also be used to convert almost any building into a liveable home.  Website is www.smallscalehomes.blogspot.com<br />If you enjoy this video, please &quot;like&quot; it, share it and comment.
