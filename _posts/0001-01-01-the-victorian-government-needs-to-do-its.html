{% raw %}Victoria Shadow Trade Minister Nick Wakeling says the Victorian government needs to “step up to the plate” to ensure there is no strike action next year. <br /><br />It comes as Victorian teachers have announced a strike in the first term of the new year in a campaign for a new workplace deal for higher pay and lighter workloads. <br /><br />“To put fear into children to say that they’re going to start a third year potentially, at home, is just clearly outrageous,” Mr Wakeling told Sky News host Caleb Bond. <br /><br />“The government needs to step up to the plate, it needs to do its job, it has until Christmas to ensure that there is no strike action in the start of next year. <br /><br />“We want the government to ensure that there’s a proper process in place, that the union doesn’t have to resort strike action because you know what? At the end of the day, it punishes kids, it punishes parents, and Victorians deserve better.”{% endraw %}
