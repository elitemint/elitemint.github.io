{% raw %}Male nurse Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) is poised to propose to his girlfriend Pam (Teri Polo) during a weekend stay at her parents' home. But here's the catch... he needs to ask her father first. Alas, the fur flies as Jack Byrnes, Pam's cat-crazy, ex-CIA father, played hysterically by Academy Award winner Robert De Niro, takes an immediate dislike to her less-than-truthful beau. Greg's quest for approval gets seriously sidetracked as Murphy's Law takes over an d a hilarious string of mishaps turns him into a master of disaster and total pariah in the eyes of the entire family... all except his shell-shocked girlfriend, who can't believe she still loves her one-man wrecking crew. Meet the Parents, from the director of Austin Powers, is an uproarious blockbuster hit that bombards you with one laugh after another, as true love tries to conquer all, against all odds.<br /><br />Rent it now on Digital, Blu-ray, and DVD here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.uphe.com/movies/meet-the-parents">https://www.uphe.com/movies/meet-the-parents</a><br /><br />Sign-up to receive updates, sneak peeks and offers here:Â <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://uni.pictures/emailyt">http://uni.pictures/emailyt</a><br /><br />#MeetTheParents #RobertDeNiro #BenStiller{% endraw %}
