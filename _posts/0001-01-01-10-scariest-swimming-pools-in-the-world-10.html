And if you live in Arizona like me, then you are impossibly thankful for that. Summer means so frigging much, excruciating heat, AC on full blast, ice cream, and of course, cooling off with a nice dip in a pool!<br />Pools have been a staple of any summer event, whether its a large public pool, some epic water park, or even someones personal pool. It’s always refreshing to take a dip and relax. However...The difference between most pools and what I’m about to talk about today? Most public and private pools aren’t terrifying.<br />Some pools out there want to go that extra mile and not only give you an experience you wont forget, but also scare the hell out of you while doing it. Thankfully though, I don’t think you’ll find any floaters in these pools.<br />From a pool high up in the sky with no harness to a pool where you’re surrounded by mountains, here are ten of the scariest pools in the world,<br />With all that said and done, lets begin shall we? #10: Marina Bay Sands.<br />The Marina Bay Sands resort is a luxury location in Singapore, with several different amenities for guests, including shops and casinos. But undoubtedly one of its best views would be its pool, located on the top of the resort itself. If you’re like and hate heights, you’re probably thinking of one thing: Nope. Nope nope, nope nope nope. And I don’t blame you if you do think that. This is a pool on top of 57 levels of hotel, with zero guard rails or safety precautions seemingly. This looks like a lawsuit waiting to happen. However, it seems to not have any real problems attributed to it, so I guess thats pretty neat. This pool spans all three of the hotel buildings, stretching 146 meters in total, making it both a long pool, and still very very terrifying.<br />#9: Holiday Inn, Shanghai.<br />Alright...Last entry wasn’t enough for you, I guarantee you this one will be. The last entry at least had the decent to keep the pool on the same place as the building. This horrifying monstrosity of engineering and design? This one is gonna give me a heart attack just by staring at the picture What you’re seeing here is a pool suspended from the roof the Holiday inn, minecraft style. No real supports here, glass floor at the bottom<br /> to show you just how high up you are. Yeah...Pretty terrifying. This pool sits ajar from the roog at the Holiday Inn Pudong, Kangqiao, where this pool allows you to take a ast view of the city below...For better or for worse. Seriously, this idea alone seems like it was made in Minecraft and It’s giving me anxiety.<br />#8: New Zealand Hilton hotel.<br />Aight. Admittedly slightly less terrifying then our previous entries here, but still kinda nerve wracking. This pool is located a the the Hilton hotel in Auzkland New Zealand, and as you can see, has less of a focus on the down below, and more a focus on the side view. Giving you not only a view of the landscape across, but also passerbys below a chance to see you show off that new swim suit or swim some laps, this pool has reinforced glass situated beside it. This is scary on the aforementioned facts alone, but this has the added bonus scare factor of allowing people to judge your beach body, and your swim form. The ground may hurt when you fall 50 stories, but words can hurt more.<br />#7: Koh Samui Blood pool - Thailand.<br />I’ll admit, this pool is far less terrifying to me personally then our first two entries. Scary? Nah. Unsettling? Oh Bloody hell yes. And Bloody is a very appropriate term to use for this entry as this pool seems to literally be filled with Blood. Kinda like it was a shark feeding frenxy before...But thankfully the actual explanation is far less gruesome. This is the Koh Samui Blood pool, located in Thailand, part of the Chawing Beach resort. The blood red hue doesn;t come from any additives or, thankfully real blood, but actually comes from the orange, red and yellow tiles laid below. The combo of these colors mixed with the rippling waters gives it a bloody appearance, making it a pretty good example of minimalist design. Safe to swim in, but you might get weird looks from some of your more squeamish friends.<br />#6: Hemeroscopium house, Madrid.<br />Moving onto one of the few personal pools on this list...Actually I think this may be the ONLY personal pool here....Moving on, we have this rather bizarre looking home in Madrid. I know I complained about the Holiday Inn hotel earlier, but this one looks...{% endraw %}
