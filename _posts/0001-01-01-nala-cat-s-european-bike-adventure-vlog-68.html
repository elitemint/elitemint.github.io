{% raw %}With a few of our things needing fixed, we decided we would head towards the biggest city to get it all sorted. The fog and lack of visibility made us stop right in front of the big hill we had to get over to reach the city Ljubljana so we set up camp where we were sheltered from the snow. It was a cold night and the first real snow of this winter so taking our big winter sleeping bag was definitely the right call as it kept us nice and warm all night. Once we tackled the big hill the next day we reached the capital of Slovenia where we'll be staying for a few days to get not only my bike fixed but also more importantly to get my hair cut. <br /><br />TURN ON SUBTITLES ❤️ <br />Our channel now has subtitles for the (majority of) people who don't have a clue what I'm saying.
