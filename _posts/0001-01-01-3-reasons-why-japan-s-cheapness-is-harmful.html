{% raw %}Living in Japan, it’s very difficult to notice that this country is actually very “cheap,” and until I read this book “Cheap Japan: Price indicates Japan’s stagnation,” I didn’t know about it either. I also did not know that Japan being a cheap country causes much more harm to our society than I ever imagined, and that it is a severe social problem that we all need to face in order to preserve Japan for the future.<br /><br />So today, I would like to first explain the meaning of “Japan is cheap,” as well as the reason why. At the end of the video, I will also explain about the horrifying problems that this situation is causing,<br />many of which I believe you never knew existed. I hope this video will be a chance for you to look at Japan from a different point of view.<br /><br />By the way, this book compares Japan with many other countries to express its cheapness so if you live in any of the countries I mention, it would be great if you could let me know in the comments how you feel about the claims.<br /><br />[Time codes]<br />0:00 Let's START!<br />1:50 How CHEAP Japan is<br />6:18 Why Japan is CHEAP<br />13:11 How CHEAPNESS is Harmful to the Society<br />19:42 Today's Conclusion<br /><br />▼Who is Shogo?
