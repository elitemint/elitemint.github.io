{% raw %}These designer &quot;Swimwear Pantalones&quot; may help you swim, while moving both legs separately ) or just keep warm in a particular time of day and look fashionable while near a pool or man made lagoon these new designer swimwear pants may even help our ecosystem in many ways more than one.. For now they are just named pantalons, man fin's, or swimwear pants ( Real Swimwear Pants ! Eventually will be for men and women alike as well😁) This may look like any favorite water animal fin ; to dolphins or even two jelly fish swimming side by side but almost anything you may think of that could be a fin! <br />for me thinking glowing starfish that gloom under the moon light or maybe sand castles that stay together in the water ! ..☔💕😊✌❄ remember this is just one part of the legging.. Still debating if this is for the left or right leg you wear this on ? 😊 jk .. at this moment im Thinking in the line of using waterproof fabric, rubber like plastic lining for the bottom like Fins and maybe using magnetics inside the rubberlastic fins .. but first just going to keep it simple with mesh, buttons polyester fabric, and some productive creativity for the concept.. 😉 Please leave any comments with any support, if you may .  Thank you for your individual advice .  I hope we all could wear this one day for the better cause of all humans alike... and for cows, whales and birds you may see still breathing..   😕😇😁.{% endraw %}
