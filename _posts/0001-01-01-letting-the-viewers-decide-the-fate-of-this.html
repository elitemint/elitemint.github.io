{% raw %}I get asked a lot if I ever buy cars that are not what I expected.  The answer is, &quot;yes&quot;.  It goes both ways.  I have bought cars that were not as nice as I thought once I took a closer look and I have bought ones that were much better than expected.  This 2009 Pontiac G8 GT is the later. <br /><br />About the car:  The tires are at 50%.  The brake pads are at 40% and rotors do have rust spots and pulsation.  Typical LS exhaust manifold leak.  Windows are 5% tint all around. The Corsa exhaust retails for $2000 new.  I did not get any floor mats.  Two keys and both work.  All windows, locks and seats work.  Rust free southern car so it would be a shame to subject it to salty winters but, hey, do what you want if you buy it.  The engine mounts have been replaced already and I cannot confirm any internal engine work but someone has been there before. <br /><br />All you will have to do is transfer the title into your name and register it. If you happen to be from Illinois, I will handle all that for you.  Again, it will have a clear IL title with a rebuilt brand (what is commonly referred to as a rebuilt title). PRICES ARE NOT NEGOTIABLE! So here are the options to buy the car the way you want it.<br /><br />The bare minimum to pass inspections and for a good daily driver.  This includes replacing the complete RF suspension, wheel and a new tire.  A used liner and fender painted to match, no blends (will be very close but never perfect.  Just being honest).  Buff the scratches on right doors and quarter.  Reattach the front bumper.  A wheel alignment, oil change, removing all the stickers and quick detail will also be done. This is the best option for a limited budget that you can build on as funds allow while still having a cheap, clean, rust-free Pontiac G8 GT to drive in the meantime. $10,500 (title, tax, license and doc fees not included)<br /><br />Additional work:  <br />Repaint front bumper and grilles:  $600<br />Blend RF door and hood to color match fender:  $500<br />Repaint shark fin antenna:  $50<br />Repaint rear spoiler:  $100<br />Repaint LR door, blend L 1/4 and LF door: $700<br />Repair A pillar dent and repaint:  $200<br />New brake pads and rotors front and rear: $500<br />Each additional tire mounted and balanced $220<br />OEM tire inflation compressor and holder:  $100<br /><br /><br />Out of state buyers must secure your own shipping or I'd be happy to pick you up at the airport if you want to drive it home. <br /><br />So if you are interested in purchasing this G8 fill out a contact form on my website and someone will be replying via email as soon as possible.  <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.vehcor.com/">https://www.vehcor.com/</a><br /><br />Amazon store:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/vehcor">https://www.amazon.com/shop/vehcor</a><br /><br />For Vehcor merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/vehcor-3">https://teespring.com/stores/vehcor-3</a>{% endraw %}
