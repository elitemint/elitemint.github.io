By surprise and without warning, the three leaders, Joe Biden, Boris Johnson and Scott Morrison, presented AUKUS, the latest military alliance on the planet.<br /> <br />Under this agreement, Australia will transform its navy into one of the most powerful in the world thanks to the incorporation of new nuclear submarines. It will also acquire Tomahawk missiles and will participate in the development of hypersonic weapons, quantum technology and artificial intelligence systems. All with one goal: to contain China's expansionism and growing political-military influence in the Indo-Pacific.<br /> <br />But what exactly does this agreement consist of, and why precisely Australia? And perhaps the most important question of all: What are the implications for the world's most important region? In this video we tell you all the details.<br /><br />Join the VisualPolitik community and support us on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/VisualPolitik">https://www.patreon.com/VisualPolitik</a>{% endraw %}
