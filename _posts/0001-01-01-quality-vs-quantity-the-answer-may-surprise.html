Instructed the first half that they will be marked by the quantity of pots they produced. The more you build, the better your mark. He told the second half of the class that they will be marked on the quality of the pot they make. The students had an hour and a half to complete their pots. When the students finished their pieces, the teacher lined them up to compare.<br /> <br />To the teacher's surprise, his social experiment did not turn out the way he assumed. He had assumed that the students who had focused on the quality of their one pot, would have had the best pieces. But the results showed that the group who had focused on the quantity created the better pots.<br /> <br />Dumbfounded he asked his students, &quot;Wait, how did that even happen?&quot;<br /> <br />One of the students replied &quot;wellâ€¦ the more pots I created, the better I got at creating pots. So I made my mistakes in the first few, but got better by the time I made the final one.&quot;<br /> <br />Meanwhile, the students who focused on quality spent all their time trying to fix the first poor pot they made.<br /> <br />We hold the assumption that quality trumps quantity. Even more, that they are trade-offs, where we sacrifice one for the other. But what if they were more connected?<br /> <br />As we can see, in creativity and leadership, quantity leads to quality.<br /> <br />So when we embrace the quantity of our failures and start looking at them as attempts, we can begin to be confident that we're on the journey of quality and success.{% endraw %}
