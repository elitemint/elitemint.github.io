{% raw %}Hoarder Nicky can't stop buying clothes, shoes, and handbags. She has so much stuff she hasn't even been in her wardrobe for over 4 years. Nicky says she's ready to change her ways by sorting out her house and by selling some of the belongings she's held onto for so many years. Julia is a former air stewardess who has collected her hoard from overseas. She has bought something from every country she has been to which has taken over her loft and life. She wants to declutter and needs help doing so. <br /><br />Only Human celebrates and explores the unique and personal qualities we all have.  Our channel offers a range of TV series and documentaries about human experiences and life journeys - while looking at the challenges life throws at us, turning ordinary people into everyday heroes. <br /><br />Like our content?
