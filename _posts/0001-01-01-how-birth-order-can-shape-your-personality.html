{% raw %}Have you ever heard that the oldest kid in a family tends to be very responsible, while children who have no siblings are far more likely to be selfish and demanding? Are these merely stereotypes, or is it really true? Today, we’ve decided to find the answer to this intriguing question How Birth Order Can Shape Your Personality?<br /><br />The birth order theory began in the late 1920s with Alfred Adler, Sigmund Freud’s friend, and colleague. Adler believed that the order in which you are born into a family inherently affects your personality. According to him, the oldest child, for example, tends to be conservative, power-oriented, and predisposed toward leadership. Do you think it's true?<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS: <br />The first-born child 0:38<br />The middle child 0:55<br />The youngest child 1:21<br />The only child 1:53<br />How birth order affects IQ scores 2:24<br />How birth order affects your personality 3:13<br />Is birth order really that important? 3:48<br /><br />#birthorder #siblings #yourpersonality<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />- According to Alfred Adler, firstborns grow up to be caring, more willing to become parents, and more likely to take initiative.<br />- The middle kids in a family often tend to be ambitious, but they are rarely selfish. They are also more likely to set unreasonably high goals for themselves.<br />- Last-borns are usually highly motivated to surpass their older sisters and brothers. They achieve big success and earn recognition in their chosen field very often.<br />- Being overly pampered by their parents, the single kid expects pampering and protection from everyone around, too. Dependency and self-centeredness are the leading qualities of their lives.<br />- Older children generally show higher performance on intelligence tests. However, the scientists found no birth-order effects on emotional stability and imagination.<br />- Firstborns tend to be more honest and dominant. However, they are also less sociable and less resistant to stress. Middle children tend to be more conscientious and diligent.<br />- Birth order may have a certain impact on your personality or intelligence; however, don’t forget that parent-child relationships and the upbringing that children receive in their homes are much more important factors in shaping their lives as individuals.<br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a>{% endraw %}
