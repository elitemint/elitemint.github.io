This makes it easy to take advantage of all the health benefits without packing on any extra pounds.<br /><br />➡️ Allicin<br />One specific compound found in garlic that I want to point out is known as Allicin. It's a defense molecule that has a broad range of biological activities within the body. Researchers believe that allicin can provide a boost to the immune system and even prevent certain diseases from occurring. A group of scientists wanted to test whether or not eating garlic could help prevent lung cancer. Their studies actually found that eating raw garlic two or more times per week did appear to decrease the risk of lung cancer in their test subjects. Further research is needed in this area, however, the preliminary results do seem to be promising.<br /><br />➡️ Garlic vs Bacterial Infections<br />Garlic may help prevent bacterial lung infections as well. A different study found that the chemical allicin may kill some of the harmful bacteria that is the root of many different types of lung infections. Garlic is also believed to reduce cholesterol levels and improve blood pressure which can indirectly benefit the lungs since the respiratory and circulatory systems work together to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. Garlic has antioxidant properties that can reduce inflammation which also benefits not only the lungs but all of the major organs and systems of the body as well. <br /><br />➡️ How to Eat Garlic?<br />To increase the consumption of this superfood, you can simply add some raw garlic to your fresh salad or vegetables and reap all of the positive health benefits. They also make supplements that can be purchased from online retailers such as Amazon. Consuming raw garlic is likely to offer more benefits in comparison.<br /><br />💥Herbs to Clear Mucus [Full Guide] ➜ ➜ ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3llMfL9">https://bit.ly/3llMfL9</a><br /><br />—————<br /><br />📗 BEST STUDY GUIDES FOR YOU<br />▪ TMC Test Bank 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2IGeqSu">http://bit.ly/2IGeqSu</a><br />▪ Hacking the TMC Exam 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2XBc8do">http://bit.ly/2XBc8do</a><br />▪ TMC Exam Bundle (Save $) 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/34pqEsV">https://bit.ly/34pqEsV</a><br />▪ Daily TMC Practice Questions 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2NnXh3C">http://bit.ly/2NnXh3C</a><br /><br />💙MORE FROM RTZ<br />▪ Free TMC Practice Exam 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2XlwASL">http://bit.ly/2XlwASL</a><br />▪ Free RRT Cheat Sheet 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2IbmOKB">http://bit.ly/2IbmOKB</a><br />▪ Resources for RT's 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2WVV5qo">http://bit.ly/2WVV5qo</a><br />▪ Testimonials 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2x7b5Gl">http://bit.ly/2x7b5Gl</a><br /><br />🌐FOLLOW US<br />▪ Instagram 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2FhF0jV">http://bit.ly/2FhF0jV</a><br />▪ Twitter 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2ZsS6T1">http://bit.ly/2ZsS6T1</a><br />▪ Facebook 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2MSEejt">http://bit.ly/2MSEejt</a><br />▪ Pinterest 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2ZwVLPw">http://bit.ly/2ZwVLPw</a><br /><br />🚑MEDICAL DISCLAIMER<br />This content is for educational and informational purposes only.
