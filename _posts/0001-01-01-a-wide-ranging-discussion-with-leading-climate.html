{% raw %}When leading climate economist Richard Tol publicly criticized a Twitter thread of Alex Epstein’s blaming anti-fossil fuel policies for the current energy crisis, Epstein invited Tal on Power Hour to discuss the issue as well as Tol’s work in climate economics.<br /><br />The result is an illuminating and wide-ranging discussion of many topics, including:<br />- What climate economics is<br />- Criticisms of climate economics by Noah Smith and others for not portraying man-made climate change as sufficiently catastrophic<br />- The philosophical assumptions underlying climate catastrophism<br />- How both Tol’s and Epstein’s work is based on a pro-human standard of evaluation<br />- Why Richard Tol withdrew from a major role in the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change<br />- How politics shapes every facet of the IPCC<br />- The role of government restrictions on fossil fuel production and transportation in the energy crisis<br />- The role of standard boom/bust cycles in the energy crisis<br />- The role of unexpected demand in the energy crisis<br /><br />Support the Center for Industrial Progress: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://industrialprogress.com/accelerate​">http://industrialprogress.com/accelerate​</a><br /><br />Purchase The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels on Amazon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2SOOHPo​">https://amzn.to/2SOOHPo​</a><br /><br />Speaking and media inquiries: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://industrialprogress.com/speaking/​">http://industrialprogress.com/speaking/​</a><br /><br />Subscribe to the podcast: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/2twmMET​">https://apple.co/2twmMET​</a>{% endraw %}
