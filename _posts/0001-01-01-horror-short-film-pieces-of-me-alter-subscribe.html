After a terrible audition, Natalie's agent tells her that this time it's her acting chops that aren't cutting it. In order to land the role of her dreams, Natalie must dig deep into the character and understand the anguish of a grieving mother. Without any experiences of her own to draw from, Natalie visits the grieving mother of one of her victims in order to eat her brain and steal her memories. <br /><br />&quot;Pieces of Me&quot; Credits:<br />Writer &amp; Director<br />Julia Max<br /><br />Cast<br />Caroline Kaplan<br />Caroline Williams<br /><br />Producers<br />Lovell Holder<br />Ian MacAllister McDonald<br />Julia Max<br /><br />Cinematographer<br />Matthew Plaxco<br /><br />Editor<br />Benjamin Shearn<br /><br />Sound<br />Mike Datz<br /><br />Music<br />Wojciech Golczewski<br /><br />Production Designer<br />Kate Zarvis<br /><br />Special FX Makeup<br />Josh Russell<br />Sierra Russell<br /><br />About ALTER:<br />ALTER is an ever-expanding platform for the most daring storytellers in the world of horror.
