{% raw %}I was intending on saving these for various videos but I decided to just put them all into one and the only music that truly felt appropriate was classical music. Unfortunately, I forgot to enable my microphone for recording in the first game. The chapter names are meant to be what was the downfall of the players. The first allowing me to provoke him into teamkills, the second losing his composure enough to lie, and the third miscalculating what throwing a incendiary grenade could cause. These clips were carefully curated for gamers like you. Enjoy! :-) <br /><br />Clickable Timestamps:<br />Provocation (0:00)<br />Exasperation (04:35)<br />Miscalculation (10:03)<br />Credits (14:33)<br /><br />Links/Other stuff:<br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/noobdogs">https://discord.gg/noobdogs</a><br />AdvancedAim: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://advancedaim.net/">https://advancedaim.net/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/noobdoggy">https://twitter.com/noobdoggy</a><br />Steam: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198451257263">https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198451257263</a><br />Merch store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/noob-dog">https://teespring.com/stores/noob-dog</a><br />Second Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8LUyM57aKoHQFM12M4lhpQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8LUyM57aKoHQFM12M4lhpQ</a><br />Shorts Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFemo70VE4dI0B5UblxRZ4w">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFemo70VE4dI0B5UblxRZ4w</a>{% endraw %}
