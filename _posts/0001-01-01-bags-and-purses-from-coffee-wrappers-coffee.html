{% raw %}Coffee wrappers turned into a bag, purse, and cellphone case. I watched as my wife cut coffee wrappers, folded, assembled, and finished my cellphone case. I see on YouTube it's a big business in Mexico. These bags and purses are very beautiful... and they're from thing we throw away... coffee wrappers, candy wrappers, etc.{% endraw %}
