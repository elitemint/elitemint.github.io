{% raw %}Today we delve into why exactly I haven't been streaming or enjoying Splatoon 2 as much as I used to lately.<br /><br />We delve into a heart to heart retrospective with Keen about many of the weapons that made the game fun for them, how they were nerfed, and what happened as a result. We also discuss how the risk/reward shifts with buffs and nerfs and explain why you see so many shooters everywhere.<br /><br />More streams at:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/KeenSaysGM">https://www.twitch.tv/KeenSaysGM</a><br /><br />Twitter to stay up to date:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/KeenSaysGM">https://twitter.com/KeenSaysGM</a><br /><br />Full Stream VOD channel: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAzS...">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAzS...</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sendou.ink/">https://sendou.ink/</a><br /><br />Editing by me *wow*<br /><br />Timestamps:<br /><br />Intro/Disclaimers: 0:00<br />Remember to Do This 3:34<br />Forms of Power Creep 4:01<br />How did the developers generally approach balancing? 5:31<br />How Balancing can affect all levels of play/How strong WERE some weapons before being nerfed? 7:37<br />3 Major Examples of Balancing Changes:<br />Explosher 9:44<br />Sorella Brella 21:58<br />Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau 31:14<br />Uh Oh, Poor Balancing 39:10<br />The Shortcomings of Balancing/Why difficult weapons need to feel GOOD to play 40:04<br />So what have we learned?/The mileage of easy to play low risk weapons 45:34<br />The BEST special weapons in the game and how they limit viable options even further 52:00<br />The Antifun Gun 59:12<br />The Antifun Gun's....Nerfs? 1:02:43<br />Why is it bad to have a meta with almost only shooters? 1:04:10<br />Conclusion/Closing Thoughts 1:09:14<br /><br />Music:<br /><br />Persona 4 Golden OST- A Sky Full Of Stars<br />Persona 4 OST I'll Face Myself - 2nd Version<br />A Gaze That Invited Disaster - VA-11 Hall-A<br />Nighttime Maneuvers - VA-11 Hall-A<br />Bug Fables OST - 64 - Termite Capitol<br />Orange Waltz - Butaotome<br />Slow Night - Takayan - Cafe de Touhou 2 <br />Seaside - Bizen - Cafe de Touhou 3<br />Lotus - KA=YA - Cafe de Touhou 1<br />mental sketch modified (A to S) - flap+frog<br />paine - flap+frog<br />Apollo - flap+frog<br />Galaxy in a Pot (Eirin) - Touhou Lost Word<br />Sun, Moon, and Talia - flap + frog<br />flap+frog - stepIllumination (Garage Refix by Musicarus)<br />flap+frog - starlight snowwhite<br />Katawa Shoujo OST - Raindrops and Puddles<br /><br />Weapons I talked about and their balance changes:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Custom_Dualie_Squelchers#Version_history">https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Custom_Dualie_Squelchers#Version_history</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Explosher#Version_history">https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Explosher#Version_history</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Custom_Explosher#Version_history">https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Custom_Explosher#Version_history</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Splat_Brella#Version_history">https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Splat_Brella#Version_history</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Sorella_Brella#Version_history">https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Sorella_Brella#Version_history</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Kensa_.52_Gal#Version_history">https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Kensa_.52_Gal#Version_history</a><br /><br />Hey if you're this low into the thumbnail then thanks bc compiling this took me about an hour{% endraw %}
