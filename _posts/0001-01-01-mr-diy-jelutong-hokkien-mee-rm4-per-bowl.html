{% raw %}One of the most reasonably-priced Hokkien Mee in Penang is the stall in front of Mr. DIY, Jelutong. Located in the small hawker center, this Hokkien Mee is still sold at RM4 per bowl until today. With an additional of 50 cents you can get a large bowl and an additional of RM1 you can enjoy additional prawns or pork ribs. Selling over 10 years passing down from the mother to her daughter, this stall serves a good Hokkien Mee with a reasonable price.<br /><br />Although it's priced at just RM4 per bowl, the noodles and ingredients given are generous. The taste of the soup is classic with a savoury touch. The soup is not too thick but it's flavourful with a balanced taste of prawn and pork ribs.<br /><br />Address:<br />Jalan Jelutong, 11600 Penang (In front of Mr. DIY, Jelutong)<br />Operation Hours:<br />5:00am - 10:00am (Sunday Close)<br /><br />Music: Ruminate - Secrets<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/channel/UCm-8TgCO...">https://youtube.com/channel/UCm-8TgCO...</a><br />Promoted by: Travel Vlog No Copyright Background Music<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TravelVlogN...">https://www.youtube.com/c/TravelVlogN...</a><br />Video Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/rQhSa0qutRo">https://youtu.be/rQhSa0qutRo</a>{% endraw %}
