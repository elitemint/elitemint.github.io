{% raw %}Receive Your Next Objective at Mighty Monument &amp; Place Surveillance Cameras Locations - Fortnite<br /><br />For one of the Week 1 Season Quests in Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 3 Season 1, you need to do two quest steps, &quot;Receive your next Quest Objective at Mighty Monument&quot; and then &quot;Place Surveillance Cameras in a Single Match&quot;.<br /><br />This one is fairly simple to do. The Monument is the very large Foundation Statue on the right hand side of the map. Land here, and behind the Monument you can find two areas to place Surveillance Cameras quite close to each other. Simply place the two Surveillance Cameras where I do to complete this quest.<br /><br />===============<br /><br /><br /><br />Subscribe Here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/N4tdAa">https://goo.gl/N4tdAa</a><br /><br /><br /><br />How I Record my Gameplay: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/48YTtm">https://goo.gl/48YTtm</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Contact Me:<br /><br /><br /><br />▶ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/harryninetyfour">http://www.twitter.com/harryninetyfour</a><br /><br />▶ PSN: HarryNinetyFour_<br /><br />▶ Xbox Live: HarryNinetyFour{% endraw %}
