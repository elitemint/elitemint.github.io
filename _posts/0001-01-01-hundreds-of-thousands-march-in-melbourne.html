{% raw %}Worldwide Freedom Rally in Melbourne. 20.11.21. A 30-minute march through the march, sped up x 4. <br /><br />Paul Kaspar (vocals) and Bradley Marshall (keyboard and back-up vocals) are the performers of the first song &quot;Rise&quot;. (does anyone have a link to support them?)<br />The second song is by 'Who's Asking&quot; (does anyone have a link to support them?)<br /><br />My arms were absolutely dead after this. ABC reported &quot;thousands&quot; and there was no frontpage mention or pictures of this crowd on the newspapers this morning!!!<br /><br />To those ripping my content, stop it, thank you. I need to make a few dollars (to in the very least, pay for a physio from taking this shot) from ad revenue so just share the link instead. <br /><br />If you appreciate these videos (and haven't been financially smashed by bureaucratic decisions, Federal and State), please consider shouting me a coffee (or two) here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/samtruearrow">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/samtruearrow</a><br /><br />Telegram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://t.me/truearrow1">https://t.me/truearrow1</a><br /><br />Be civil in the comments, thank you.{% endraw %}
