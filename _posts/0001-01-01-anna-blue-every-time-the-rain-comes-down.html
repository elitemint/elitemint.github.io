Maybe watch them if you‘re curious, ok? <br /><br />Anna barely turned 12 years old when she started writing her own songs, a need to give her many feelings a vent. Inspirations were plenty – Dashboard Confessional influenced her just as much as 30 Seconds to Mars. It may be her youth that blurred any style restrictions: Emo, Punk or Gothic have always been equally represented in her music collection – as long as it was true passion that lead the artists.<br />That is exactly the key element in her songs: they may all just be written by Anna in her room – but there always is that emphasis on true feelings and expressive lyrics.<br />This candor might be strange for some but it is just this distinction in her thinking, her direct lyrics and her vivid songwriting that make up Anna’s style. A style that speaks directly from the hearts of her many listeners.{% endraw %}
