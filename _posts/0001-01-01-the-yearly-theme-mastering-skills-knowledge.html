{% raw %}The year of learning is my secret to mastering complex concepts and knowledge as well as solidifying new habits into my life ever since 2014. It's something I'm very passionate about because it is incredibly sustainable, takes almost no extra time on your part and works on your best days and your worst days. I've used it to improve in broad and difficult areas like physical exercise, mindfulness, productivity and nutrition. It helps you eliminate the unnecessary noise and cement your focus on the essential - and that's when true progress can be made.<br /><br />❤️ SUBSCRIBE:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2ItoIJf">https://bit.ly/2ItoIJf</a> ❤️<br /><br />💫 WATCH MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS 💫 <br />► My self-care routine: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2K0niX9">https://bit.ly/2K0niX9</a><br />► I don't want a full time job: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/34XbNYJ">https://bit.ly/34XbNYJ</a><br /><br />✨ Hello dear friend ✨<br />I am Antonia and in my videos I talk about minimalism, self-improvement &amp; productivity!<br />If you liked the video, you can SUBSCRIBE to my channel and activate notifications so you never miss it when a new video is out! 🔔<br /><br />⭐ STAY IN TOUCH ⭐<br />Connect With Me On Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/antoniatheuniverse/">https://www.instagram.com/antoniatheuniverse/</a><br />Visit My Website <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://antoniatheuniverse.com/">https://antoniatheuniverse.com/</a><br /><br />✉️ E-Mail: antonia@antoniatheuniverse.com<br /><br />⚙️ GEAR I USE FOR MY VIDEOS ⚙️<br />Editing laptop*: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/xaxB">https://geni.us/xaxB</a><br />Camera#1*: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/2QhFhD">https://geni.us/2QhFhD</a><br />Camera#2*: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/6ZI9W">https://geni.us/6ZI9W</a><br />Gimbal*: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/kUswT">https://geni.us/kUswT</a><br />Microphone #1*: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/AItUh">https://geni.us/AItUh</a> <br />Microphone #2*: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/Qh8K">https://geni.us/Qh8K</a><br />Studio Lights #1*: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/PS3WyJ">https://geni.us/PS3WyJ</a><br />Studio Lights #2*: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/XYi3Mq">https://geni.us/XYi3Mq</a><br />Editing Software*: Adobe Premiere Pro CC<br /><br />🎶🎵  Music 🎵🎶<br />All the music I used comes from EpidemicSound, get a 30-day free trial month using this link:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/s0sqrr/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/s0sqrr/</a><br /><br />* DISCLAIMER: I want to make it clear that this video and the shown description contain affiliate links.
