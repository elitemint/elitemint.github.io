{% raw %}During the summer of my sophomore year, I reflected on how quickly the pandemic ended my Boston College experience as a freshman. I missed out on so many memories and experiences academically, athletically, and socially; I decided moving forward, I would document the “best years of your life.”<br /><br />I returned to school and instantly began creating videos and capturing memories of the extraordinary life I was living. I started vlogging about being a college student and athlete during a pandemic. My “Game Day” series included filming our practices, bus rides, pre-game locker room speeches, memorable post-game moments, and team bonding activities. I then took all my footage and began coloring, editing, and posting videos of my team weekly to show others what it was like to be a lacrosse player at Boston College. Throughout this process, I developed my editing style as a content creator and my learned ability to tell a story with my camera. Not all programs or athletes, for that matter, can document their team’s journey to winning a National Championship. It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to film and play a sport at such a high level, and I am fortunate to be a part of something extraordinary.<br /><br />I have so much passion and direction for the career I am pursuing. In 2021 I quickly joined the Boston College Media Team to gain experience and knowledge for sports production and social media content. Early on, I learned how to set up and execute athletes’ photoshoots, edit in-game, and increase engagements on all social platforms. My dream career is to have the opportunity to capture athletes and their stories. I learned while working for BC’s communications department that the role of a content creator is so much more than just taking photos or headshots; it is about photographing the little moments, which initially inspired me to play a college sport at such a young age. I would not be who I am today without sports. <br /><br />2022 is a year for change. A year to choose your happiness, mental health, and athletic and academic goals, even if it means moving across the country. This spring, I will be playing lacrosse at the University of Southern California while continuing to study communications and film. I am excited for Los Angeles’s new opportunities as a content creator and college athlete. I will continue to use my platform to radiate positive energy and share the life I am so grateful to be living. #fighton! #usc<br /><br />FOLLOW ME<br />instagram: @kaitdevir <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kaitdevir/">https://www.instagram.com/kaitdevir/</a><br />food instagram: @Jerseymeals <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jerseymeals/">https://www.instagram.com/jerseymeals/</a><br />photography instagram: @kdevir_media <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kdevir_media/">https://www.instagram.com/kdevir_media/</a><br />twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/DevirKaitlin">https://twitter.com/DevirKaitlin</a><br />facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009105006525">https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009105006525</a><br />subscribe! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbYEGRSRfbfMeCHnBEqZWqw?view_as=subscriber">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbYEGRSRfbfMeCHnBEqZWqw?view_as=subscriber</a><br />US LAX: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.uslaxmagazine.com/college/women/boston-college-goalie-kait-devir-finding-her-niche-on-lacrosse-youtube">https://www.uslaxmagazine.com/college/women/boston-college-goalie-kait-devir-finding-her-niche-on-lacrosse-youtube</a><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />NIL UPDATES<br />VIS AND WHOOP ATHLETE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.voiceinsport.com/inspiration/3389">https://www.voiceinsport.com/inspiration/3389</a><br />SIDELINE SWAP ATHLETE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sidelineswap.com/r/coffeeaddict847">https://sidelineswap.com/r/coffeeaddict847</a> JOIN TODAY!<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />fav snack! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://one1brands.com">https://one1brands.com</a><br />fav coffee drink: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drinksupercoffee.com/">https://drinksupercoffee.com/</a>  USE CODE: LIFEWITHKD and save 15%<br />my fitness watch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/yd5xpgdo">https://tinyurl.com/yd5xpgdo</a><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />equipment<br />camera <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/y8lsjagq">https://tinyurl.com/y8lsjagq</a><br />lens: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/yc3blg5s">https://tinyurl.com/yc3blg5s</a><br />vlog lens: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/ya9abm9p">https://tinyurl.com/ya9abm9p</a><br />goPro: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/yajqzot2">https://tinyurl.com/yajqzot2</a><br />little tripod <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/y9egorcq">https://tinyurl.com/y9egorcq</a><br />big tripod: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/ybjwp6el">https://tinyurl.com/ybjwp6el</a><br />drone: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/y9ozj4g6">https://tinyurl.com/y9ozj4g6</a><br />mic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/ydao25nj">https://tinyurl.com/ydao25nj</a><br />editing: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecloud.adobe.com/cc/en">https://creativecloud.adobe.com/cc/en</a><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For business inquiries please contact:<br />01kdevir@gmail.com<br />––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––<br />MUSIC IN MY VIDEO<br />EPIDEMIC SOUNDS{% endraw %}
