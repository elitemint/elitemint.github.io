{% raw %}For today's free wire jewellery tutorial, I'd like a share a technique I've developed especially for absolute beginners, to create a secure pendant for a tumbled gemstone.<br /><br />Many of us purchase tumbled gems when we begin our interests in jewellery or crystals or gemstones for healing; they are an affordable introduction to gemstones and can begin a lifelong love for nature's beauty.<br /><br />Tumbled gems, or tumblestones, are often unevenly formed, and I thought that they deserved their very own variation of a wire pendant cage, to accommodate their asymmetric nature.<br /><br />Happy New Year 2022, may it bring you that which will benefit you, may you be blessed with love  and balance in your life.
