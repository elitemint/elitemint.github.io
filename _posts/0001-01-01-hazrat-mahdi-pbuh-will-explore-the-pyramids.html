{% raw %}Excerpt from Mr. Adnan Oktar's Live Conversation on A9TV dated October 24th, 2015<br /><br />ADNAN OKTAR: Our Prophet (saas) says: “Imam Mahdi (pbuh)”, now note this, “will conquer the Pyramids of Egypt, open them…&quot; In other words, he will open the pyramids.     &quot;… and acquire the treasures and holy relics, the secrets there.&quot; Who knows what is inside? We all long for this, right? Note that our Prophet (saas) says that the Mahdi (pbuh) will explore the Pyramids, that he will reveal the secrets, mysteries, and treasures  there. Not even one-tenth of the pyramids have not been explored yet.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.a9.com.tr/izle/216649/Adnan-Oktarin-Sohbetlerinden-Secme-Bolumler/Hazrat-Mahdi-(pbuh)-will-explore-the-pyramids-of-Egypt-and-acquire-the-holy-relics-and-secrets">http://www.a9.com.tr/izle/216649/Adnan-Oktarin-Sohbetlerinden-Secme-Bolumler/Hazrat-Mahdi-(pbuh)-will-explore-the-pyramids-of-Egypt-and-acquire-the-holy-relics-and-secrets</a>{% endraw %}
