{% raw %}Planting evidence. faking witness statements and misspending of seized money are some of the accusations a police officer has claimed Scotland’s chief constable ignored “documented proof” that three colleagues were corrupt.<br /><br />PC Robert Brown, who has nearly 30 years’ service, accused Iain Livingstone of failing to act on information he was given.<br />Instead of looking at the allegations, the Lanarkshire-based constable says the chief constable’s staff passed a dossier to the department he had complained about ­­Police Scotland’s Professional Standards Department (PSD).<br /><br />The unit is tasked with probing internal complaints about police officers but has been mired in controversies.<br /><br />Brown, 48, is involved in a long-running battle with the force at an employment tribunal.<br /><br />He has tried to use the legal hearing to name and shame colleagues he claims are corrupt, but a legal challenge by the force has prevented his statements being made public.<br /><br />The officer, who is due to retire within weeks, has now used social media to accuse police leaders of failing to probe his claims of corruption.<br /><br />🔴 Follow Scarcity on socials 🔴  <br />🟪 Insta: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/ScarcityInsta">https://bit.ly/ScarcityInsta</a> 🟪<br />🟥 Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/ScarcityFB">https://bit.ly/ScarcityFB</a> 🟥<br />🟦Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/ScarcityTwitter">https://bit.ly/ScarcityTwitter</a> 🟦<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.scarcity-studios.com">https://www.scarcity-studios.com</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1XI4TFW_nEY4IFfTxUUkCg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1XI4TFW_nEY4IFfTxUUkCg/join</a><br /><br />Alpha Claims and Hire are Birmingham's leading accident management company specialising in non-fault claims. <br /><br />Are you a taxi driver?<br />Have you been involved in a accident?<br />Do you need a accident replacement car?<br /><br />Call us on: 0121 327 0382<br /><br />We stock cars for Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Solihull, Walsall Councils, and many more councils across the UK.<br />Alpha claims and hire stocks euro 6, clean air zone compliant cars. <br /><br /><br />************************************************<br /><br />Alpha claims and hire opened its doors in 2009.
