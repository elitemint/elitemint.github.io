So again, coming here, having the private consult with him-- my husband came along, and we both agreed this was the doctor and I booked it and two weeks later, I had the procedure. The procedure lasted, just like he said, about 90 minutes. I had twilight sleep. Came home; followed his instructions to the &quot;T&quot;, which is ice, ice, ice. Had a little bit of a pain killer the first two days. After that, didn't need it. I guess I was lucky, I had very slight bruising. And I was back at work exactly nine days after the procedure. It was wonderful. And that's my Cinderella story. I couldn't be happier. I was 62 and I knew this was the time for me to do the face lift before the effects got worse and worse and would be a little bit more drastic of a change. I wanted people to see me looking refreshed, having comments like, you're looking younger, did you change your hair?<br /><br />But no one actually saying, oh, did you have a face lift? And it's exactly that happened when I went back to work. Everything was saying, oh, new hairdo; I love your eye make up. Boy, that vacation was the best thing for you. You look so rested. And I had to chuckle, you know, behind me because I knew, of course, what had been done. And so I called Doctor Sessa immediately because I was so thrilled not only with the way I looked, but the responses from people. And that was it.<br /><br />Facelift Venice FL  - Before and After &quot;Completely Satisfied!&quot; Smartlift, Facelift Venice FL<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLDhoB37da4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLDhoB37da4</a>{% endraw %}
