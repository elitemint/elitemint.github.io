{% raw %}Nathan Fowler, MD, from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, provides an overview of a current Phase III study of the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, ibrutinib, in combination with rituximab versus placebo in combination with rituximab in patients with treatment-naive follicular lymphoma (NCT02947347). The superiority of the combination regimen over either of the drugs administered alone, as determined through previous clinical trials, is also described in this segment. This interview was filmed at the American Society of Oncology (ASCO) 2017 Annual Meeting in Chicago, IL.{% endraw %}
