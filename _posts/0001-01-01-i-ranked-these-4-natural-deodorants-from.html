{% raw %}Finding a good natural deodorant that actually works (and doesn't cost $300) is no easy feat. Are any of these 4 worthy??? ü§î<br />Sometime last year I did a video just like this where I ranked 5 popular natural deodorants such as Native, Schmidts, and Jasons. Today, I'm reviewing and ranking the 4 more recent ones I've tried, and ranking them in order of worst to best!! I know the natural deodorant struggle is very real, so I hope this video is helpful for you.
