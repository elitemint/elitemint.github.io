{% raw %}The human body energy field plays a very important role in our health. Everything is energy, everything in our existence is connected to a field of electromagnetic vibrational frequencies. Sound healing synchronizes brain waves to achieve profound states of relaxation, helping to restore the normal vibratory frequencies of the cells in our bodies. ‚ÄúTo heal is to make the sound‚Äù.<br /><br />Everything is vibrating at specific frequencies, and energy is transferred through vibration. <br /><br />Bacteria, viruses, and other organisms living in your body have their unique resonant frequency. You can tackle them by using the same vibration.<br /><br />üéß Visit FrequencyHeals Website for More Videos:<br />-- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.frequencyheals.com/">https://www.frequencyheals.com/</a><br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏è Join FrequencyHeals Facebook Group:<br />-- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/frequencyheals">https://www.facebook.com/groups/frequencyheals</a><br /><br />An infection occurs when another organism enters your body and causes disease. The organisms that cause infections are very diverse, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. The symptoms of an infection can vary depending on the type of infection that you have. Some general symptoms include fever, body pain, fatigue, coughing, sneezing, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. You can acquire an infection in many different ways, such as directly from a person with an infection, contaminated food or water, and the bite of an insect.<br /><br />Treatment for infections depends on the type. If you have a bacterial infection, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics. However, antibiotics are not effective in treating a viral infection. There are also specific drugs for fungal and parasitic infections. You must take the entire course of medications, or the pathogen may develop resistance and become harder to eliminate. Additionally, frequencies of 1550, 880, 802, 786, 728, 465, 444, 125, 95, 72, 48, 20, 304, 1.2, 5500, 676, 422, 766 Hz can help with infections in general.<br /><br />#FrequencyHeals #infection #viralinfection #bacterialinfection #parasiticinfection #fungalinfection #beats #homeremedy{% endraw %}
