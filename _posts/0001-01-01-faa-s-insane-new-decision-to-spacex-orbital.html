{% raw %}While SpaceX is rapidly innovating with its Starship and needs to test it extensively by<br />sending it to orbit and have many fans rooting for it, not everybody welcomes the idea.<br />The only arbiter in the tussle of allowing SpaceX to send its Starship to orbit for the first<br />time is the Federal Aviation Administrator, FAA!<br />Join us as we examine what the FAA just with SpaceX and why it changes everything!<br />The Starship requires rigorous testing because of the sensitivity of its purpose. The<br />hope of a whole nation rests on it because NASA will use it to resume sending<br />American astronauts to the moon. At the cost of 2.9 billion dollars, the Starship will carry<br />out the crucial step of dropping astronauts on the surface of the moon. This trip is going<br />to be historic because it will achieve many firsts:<br />It is the first time a female astronaut will walk on the moon! It is also the first time an<br />African-American will step on the moon!<br />That's not the end of NASA's use for the Starship, as the Project Artemis is a stepping<br />stone to Mars! If the Starship delivers on this moon mission, NASA will use it to put its<br />astronauts on the Red Planet!<br />This NASA's plan for Mars is different from Elon Musk's own dream of colonizing the<br />planet. He even set up Starlink for fast satellite internet to raise money for this burning<br />desire of his!<br />His dream is to send millions of explorers to Mars to live there permanently. That is not<br />a small undertaking as he reckons he needs to move one million people from earth to<br />Mars for his permanent occupation to be feasible.<br />This requires transporting both cargo and people over vast distances in space. Musk<br />needs to move much equipment like nuclear microreactors for producing electricity and<br />other machinery required to keep people alive.<br />Musk's ambitious scheme requires a powerful rocket, and that is what the Starship is. In<br />fact, it is the most powerful spaceship ever built by man! Its proportions are immense,<br />with a total height of 120 meters and a diameter of 9 meters.<br />This beast of a rocket can lift more than 100 tonnes to low earth orbit with the help of<br />about 35 Raptor rockets that each produces 2 MN of thrust! SpaceX is building them in-<br />house using a full flow staged design.<br />Designing the most powerful rocket is one thing, and it is another thing to design a<br />reusable rocket. Despite the complexity, SpaceX is doing both with the Starship!<br />While its existing rockets are partially reusable, the Starship is fully reusable at both<br />stages! It might look impossible, but that is what Musk is aiming for! He wants the lower<br />stage to launch several missions in a day, with a turn-around time of 30 minutes<br />between launches!<br />This reusability is important for Musk because that is one of the ways he wants to<br />reduce the cost associated with space travel. He wants people to be able to fund their<br />relocation to Mars with money from selling their homes and still have enough money to<br />start a new life there!<br />Because of the complexities and great expectations, SpaceX has to test the Starship<br />before putting it into action thoroughly. It can't afford to fail!<br />SpaceX has carried out dozens of tests on the Starship. After several prototypes that<br />have crashed and burned, SpaceX got landing the Starship right with the SN 15<br />prototype.<br />The company has even stacked the two stages together to assemble the tallest ever<br />rocket, although it quickly separated them for more work. However, all the tests SpaceX<br />has done have been sub-orbital. It needs to send the Starship to orbit to test some<br />crucial components and features.<br />One such component is the heat shield. At the speed with which the Starship will<br />reenter the atmosphere, lots of heat will be generated, and to protect the spacecraft,<br />SpaceX is adding heat-resistant ceramic tiles to the surface of the Starship that will bear<br />the heat.<br />SpaceX just has to send a prototype to space to test the solutions it has worked on.<br />This is where FAA comes in because the Starship is not going anywhere without FAA's<br />approval!<br />The FAA is the regulator of all the nation's civil aviation activities, including managing air<br />traffic in the US airspace. Part of its job is regulating the US commercial space<br />transportation industry. The agency licenses commercial space launch facilities and<br />private launches of space payloads.<br />Before SpaceX gets the license it needs to blast the Starship to space, the FAA will<br />perform an environmental assessment of SpaceX's facilities and operations in Boca<br />Chica, Texas.<br />The FAA basically wants SpaceX to demonstrate it has taken all necessary safety<br />precautions to ensure the minimal risk in case anything goes wrong during the launch<br />attempt.<br />In connection with this, the FAA conducted two hearings to get feedback from members<br />of the public on the process. Due to COVID restrictions, both hearings were held<br />virtually.{% endraw %}
