{% raw %}G'day Legends, hope everyone is well and getting excited for Christmas and the holiday season. In todays Episode we are you guessed it on the water for another epic oceanic adventure fishing and spearfishing the magic Broughton Island off Port Stephens. We manage a feed of fish no massive snapper like last episode but we still managed a feed and Spence run into a massive Kingfish. Once we had had enough of the rod and reel fishing we jump in for an under water spearfishing mission. So many awesome under water creatures to see including an encounter with a big Grey Nurse Shark they are honestly so beautiful to watch just cruising along it was an epic encounter a memory that will be with me a lifetime and probably haunt Spencer as he was on the bottom of the ocean when it came in and gave him a massive scare(never seen someone come to the surface so quickly). As always Guys kick back with your favourite brew and enjoy this oceanic adventure with a mix of fishing and spearfishing the one and only Broughton Island off Port Stephens. Oh and the fish that we caught were donated to a mate of mine as he had no fish so Scotty if your watching mate my fine from Maritime arrived $250 so I hope you enjoyed the feed of fish as they are up there for the most expensive fish I have ever caught/speared and not eaten.{% endraw %}
