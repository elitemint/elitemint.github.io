{% raw %}Our life can suddenly change because of some unexpected event or disaster.  This happens to EVERYONE, even the rich and famous. The important thing to remember is to not get swallowed with shock, uncontrollable emotion and even self pity. Things happen. Accept it. You may not realize it, but the more powerful the event is, the more powerfully you could be launched into a life you never expected... and probably would never have ended up in if it didn't happen. Power is energy. Might as well do something constructive with all that energy.<br />Read the life changing pocketbook &quot;Instructions for a New Life&quot; www.newlifebook.com<br />Our health channel is full of fun, educational videos <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.thehealthylife.com">http://www.thehealthylife.com</a><br />Check out our raw vegan cookbook https//www.healthycookbook.com<br />Our life-changing health products https//www.markusproducts.com<br />Cara's Instagram https//www.instagram.com/iamcarabrotman<br />Markus and Cara's Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/markusandcara">http://www.instagram.com/markusandcara</a><br />Best herbal vitamin C in the world- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.markusvitaminc.com">http://www.markusvitaminc.com</a> <br />Heal Yourself 101 book- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.healyourself101.com">http://www.healyourself101.com</a>  The ebook version is a free download if you don't want the paperback<br />the Photography Channel MarkusPix on Youtube <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/markuspix">https://www.youtube.com/markuspix</a>{% endraw %}
