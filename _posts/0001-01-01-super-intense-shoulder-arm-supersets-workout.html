{% raw %}Super sets! Super intense session! <br /><br />This upper body workout will demand a lot from your shoulders, biceps and triceps with supersets being the format! A staple involving pressing so we return to the shoulders throughout! <br /><br />For this upper body workout, you will need a pair of dumbbells, a chair for bodyweight dips and your mat! <br /><br />The dumbbells I am using for your reference are 9kg each and 6kg each!<br /><br />The timer will be on for 30 seconds of work, straight into another 30 seconds to make each superset! There will be 20 seconds rest in between each superset!<br /><br />Each superset will be performed for 3 sets in total!<br /><br />There is a staple superset that will appear 4 times in total: partial shoulder presses into full range presses! I will be using 9kg dumbbells every time this pops up!<br /><br />During the ZOTTMAN curls I will be using lighter weights (the 6kg dumbbells) as this movement is a lot on the wrists also so please reduce weight or even filled water bottles. I will also use the lighter weights for the palms up curls straight afterâ€¦. You will see why when we come to it! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥<br /><br />CLOSE TO OPEN PRESS<br />ARNOLD PRESS<br /><br />LATERAL RAISES<br />REAR DELT FLYES<br /><br />STAPLE:<br />PARTIAL PRESS<br />FULL RANGE PRESS<br /><br />DRIVING THE CAR<br />FRONTAL RAISE<br /><br />DIAGONAL RAISE<br />ARC RAISE<br /><br />STAPLE:<br />PARTIAL PRESS<br />FULL RANGE PRESS<br /><br />DIPS<br />TRICEP KICKBACKS<br /><br />TRICEP PRESS<br />SKULLCRUSHERS<br /><br />STAPLE:<br />PARTIAL PRESS<br />FULL RANGE PRESS<br /><br />HAMMER CURLS<br />WIDE CURLS<br /><br />ZOTTMAN CURLS (using 6kg weights)<br />PALMS UP CURLS<br /><br />STAPLE:<br />PARTIAL PRESS<br />FULL RANGE PRESS<br /><br />Finisher!<br /><br />ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥<br /><br />30/30/30<br /><br />DECLINE PUSH UPS<br />TRICEP PUSH UPS<br />COBRA PUSH UPS<br /><br />Please ensure you warm up the entire body prior and gently cool down after.<br /><br />These supersets are 1 minute in total but the exercises make this very intense! Try to relax and never rush the movements. It is better to do less reps with good form over rushing and increasing risk if injury. Always control the dumbbells!<br /><br />This is hard! But is amazing! I loved the challenge of the staple and I hope you do too! <br /><br />Cx<br /><br />Always ensure you warm up before any workout.
