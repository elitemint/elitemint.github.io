{% raw %}Odell Beckham Jr. and the Browns seem to be barreling towards a breakup after head coach Kevin Stefanski reportedly said in a team meeting on Wednesday that the wide receiver is â€œessentially not on the team right now,&quot; according to Michael Silver. <br /><br />The 28-year-old was told not to attend practice despite being ready to attend, per ESPN's Josina Anderson. Beckham Jr.'s representation is reportedly discussing next steps with general manager Andrew Berry, according to ESPN's Jake Trotter. <br /><br />This comes a day after Beckham Jr.'s father posted comments in an 11-minute video on social media about his son not being thrown the ball by Browns quarterbacks, primarily Baker Mayfield.{% endraw %}
