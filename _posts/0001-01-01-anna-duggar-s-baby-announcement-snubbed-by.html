{% raw %}#DuggarFamily #CountingOn<br /><br />Anna Duggar announced the birth of Madisyn Lily, her 7th child with Josh Duggar. Generally, birth announcements receive wide praise by the Duggar siblings, but there were no comments by Josh's sisters &amp; his brothers were mostly silent. <br /><br />Jessa Seewald brought Spurgeon over to the Duggars for his birthday &amp; NO ONE was there other than Anna's kids.  Is the division in the family getting worse?<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br /><br />Without a Crystal Ball is a commentary channel.
