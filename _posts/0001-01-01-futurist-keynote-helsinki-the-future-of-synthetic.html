During this keynote I zoom out across the next twenty years and show highlight reels of some of the major technologies that will turn the $6 Trillion content industry on its head.<br /><br />From synthetic works of art and imagery, which are now selling at auction for hundreds of thousands of dollars and that are good enough to rival traditional stock photography, through to the creation of synthetic music and video content so good that major record labels are signing and snapping up new ‚Äúartists‚Äù like they‚Äôre going out of fashion already. I also shone a light on the role these same technologies are playing in generating infamous DeepFakes, that are increasingly blowing past uncanny valley, and then discussed how other forms of creative machines are helping speed up innovation by thousands fold and are being used to design everything from new aircraft parts and cars, through to fashion lines, furniture, sneakers, and even interplanetary rovers.<br /><br />I then also discussed how these same technologies, as well as others, are helping democratise the creativity and content creation process for ordinary people ‚Äì a trend that is only going to get louder in the years to come. For example, imagine one day being able to talk into your smartphone, describe what you want it to create, whether it‚Äôs a piece of content or a product, and having a creative machine generate it in real time for you. As you can see from the keynote reel it‚Äôs obvious that these machines will play a major role in helping unleash and revolutionise human creativity at global scale.<br /><br />I also discussed the rise of digital humans, and virtual bloggers, and disused the future of influencers, and lifted the lid on some truly amazing technologies.{% endraw %}
