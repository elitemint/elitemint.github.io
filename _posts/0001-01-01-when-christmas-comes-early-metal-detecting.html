{% raw %}Check out my new adventure from the top of a beautiful, sunny hill, with an early Christmas present and some other nice relics.<br /><br />As it often happens I have a feeling about the area I enter. It was a little bit disappointing to see signs of human presence, without any finds. I guess, the whole area was cleaned out years ago. <br />But, if you set the bar very low and adjust to it, the disappointment can be turned into challenge where every find counts like a big success.<br />I eventually got into this mindset, even if it took me some time. It's just that sometimes you expect too much after a long/steep walk &quot;sacrifice&quot;.<br /><br />Slowly but surely the hunt started unfolding in the right direction. Unfortunately due to a malfunction of my camera, parts of the footage got lost. Because of it I couldn't show how I found the 1700's wind cap, which was located under a huge rock. The digging part must have looked &quot;spectacular&quot;.<br /><br />This was the turning point. It showed that anything is possible. I entered a more modified area and walked straight into a loud signal. The sequence sounded like the &quot;White Christmas&quot; song. I couldn't believe my eyes, when a gold plated pocketwatch popped out!<br />What a beautiful find... I would like to know how old it could be. Late 1800's?<br /><br />I was able to make a few more finds before moving back to the train station. All in all it was a great relic hunt with a huge surprise. I hope you enjoyed it.<br /><br />Thank you for watching.{% endraw %}
