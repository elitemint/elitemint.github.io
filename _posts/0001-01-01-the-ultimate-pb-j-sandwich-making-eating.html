{% raw %}We discovered in our desert island food challenge a few months back that a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is one of five foods we both could happily survive on for the rest of our lives (link to that video below if you’d like some context). So, for this week’s video, we took our love for the delicious combination and battled it out to see which twin could create the more epic, untraditional pb&amp;j. Giving ourselves three opportunities each to outdo the other, we devised our most elaborate, decadent peanut butter and jelly sandwich creations in secret and revealed, ate, and ranked them together here in a friendly, competition mukbang. <br />We hope y’all enjoy these outrageous versions of a classic combo and please be sure to give the video a ‘LIKE’ and subscribe if you’re new!<br />Much love,<br />-Pete &amp; Nate<br /><br />Desert Island Challenge: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pO2wEduB0I&amp;t=889s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pO2wEduB0I&amp;t=889s</a><br /><br />Looking to help support the channel?

We eat mostly vegetables, fruits, some whole grains and low fat dairy on the days outside these challenges. The calories consumed in a food challenge are the only calories consumed that day and sometimes the day following as well seeing our appetites are typically shot from so much food and the thought of eating is very off putting. Two days out we are back to large amounts of vegetables and increase to maintenance from there. We also often eat most of our days calories in a smaller eating window (we frequently bounce between intermittent fasting &amp; OMAD diet as it just seems to work with our lifestyles and eating preferences). Anyone with a larger than normal stomach capacity like us, the drive to push through the discomfort of a challenge like this, and a basic understanding of energy balance (calories in vs calories out) can do it with enough disciple and intention (not that we recommend it).<br />Also worth mentioning is that we do not exercise to burn the calories consumed in a challenge but rather we are able to consume higher calorie diets due to our love for endurance sports and said discipline with our daily diets. <br /><br />Q: Can you make a “What I eat in a day” / fitness focused video?<br />A: While we’re sure that type of video will eventually make its way out there, this channel is intended primarily for food entertainment. We’re still in the very early stages of establishing ourselves within this genre and we’re constantly experimenting and trying to improve upon our style to make our channel a unique experience. Food is our passion while fitness is our discipline so, while we currently only have the availability to produce one quality piece of content a week, food-centered videos is where we’ll be focusing our attention (and trust us, it’s more fun for all of us this way). Thats not to say it will never happen - it’s just not a top priority for us.  <br /> ____________________________<br /><br />Soundstripe.com Song Use Codes (PB&amp;J):<br />Funky Preacher: WC5ESGAVGGFCU4IF<br />Le Funk Du Luxe: PLVD5Q9ZJC0WSBNK<br />Rainy Day: 2ATIZOFNJY4WQP7M<br />Conversation Funk: PXDIKWYCEB9FYFJK<br />Chasing Waves: WVJQDJBURXM5RCMU<br />Boss Of The Bossa: PB11WODSSNMH9CED<br />Walkin’ The Dog: 5ODABCKLLFS2LIBF<br />The Jack: WYSNSFEQDSAW8CCY{% endraw %}
