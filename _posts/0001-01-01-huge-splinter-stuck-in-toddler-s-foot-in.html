{% raw %}In this video we demonstrate a technique for removing a large splinter from the foot of a toddler.  We would like to thank the patient's very cool mother for allowing us to document this procedure.  Additionally, we had the opportunity to demonstrate the wound healing and outcome 7 days later when the patient returned to the pediatric ED for re-evaluation.{% endraw %}
