{% raw %}As I was watching the ending to The Woman In Black I heard the little boy says this in the scene and it jogged my memory of this old song that was on the swiffer sweeper commercial and I though it would be funny to put it in the ending scene.<br /><br />I take no credit for the movie: The Woman In Black or for the music: Who's That Lady By: The Isley Brothers.{% endraw %}
