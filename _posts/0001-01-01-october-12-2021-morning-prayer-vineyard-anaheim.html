Prayer is simply communion, connection, and encounter with the Lord of heaven and earth. When we engage in prayer, our hearts become centered, stilled, and strengthened.  Before discussing WHAT to pray, let’s talk about HOW to pray. <br />                                                                                                                               - Jeremy and Katie Riddle<br /><br />IDENTITY:<br />We approach communion with the Lord not as orphans operating in scarcity, but as children of the One who made heaven and earth with unending resource. When the disciples asked Jesus how to pray, He begins with “Our Father in heaven.” This is a bold acknowledgment of our intimate relationship as children of the eternal God.<br /><br />FOCUS:<br />The Lord’s Prayer continues, “Holy is your name.” We are fixing our attention on who He is first and foremost, not our requests or burdens. This aligns our priorities rightly. We start with who we are praying to, His holiness, and prioritize that above all else. You will notice problems begin to shrink in comparison. <br /><br />AGREEMENT:<br />“Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.” We surrender our will and agenda and partner with His. This opens our hearts to a hunger that asks, “What is His will? Whatdoes His kingdom look like on earth as it is in heaven? What does it look like for me to partner with His will?” This also takes the false pressure off of trying to figure out how to pray the “right” thing and focuses us on the solution (His will) rather than the problem. <br /><br />REQUEST:<br />From here we move on to what is typically seen as “prayer,” where we ask for things. Jesus guides us on what to ask for and that is:<br /><br />1. Daily need: “Give us today our daily bread”<br />2. Repentance/forgiveness: “forgive us our sins as we have forgiven those who sinned against us.”<br />3. Guidance &amp; deliverance: “Lead is not into temptation but deliver us from the evil one.”<br /><br />PRAISE:<br />“Yours is the kingdom, power, and glory forever and ever. Amen.”<br /><br />It is so important to begin and end with Him. We acknowledge who He is and praises erupt from our very depth. <br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Subscribe to our YouTube channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/VineyardAnaheim">https://www.youtube.com/c/VineyardAnaheim</a><br /><br />Connect with Vineyard Anaheim<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.vineyardanaheim.com/">https://www.vineyardanaheim.com/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/VineyardAnaheim">https://www.facebook.com/VineyardAnaheim</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/vineyardanaheim/">https://www.instagram.com/vineyardanaheim/</a>{% endraw %}
