{% raw %}Pulled elbow, also known as annular ligament displacement or radial-head subluxation, is a common orthopedic injury in children.1 In the United States, the incidence of emergency department visits for pulled elbow is estimated at 2.7 per 1000 persons younger than 18 years of age.2 The median age at presentation is 2 years.3,4 The injury is unique to infants and young children because the radial head is less bulbous than it is in older persons and may easily become displaced. Reduction of a pulled elbow is a safe procedure that can be performed in the outpatient setting.{% endraw %}
