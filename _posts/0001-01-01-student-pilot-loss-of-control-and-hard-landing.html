{% raw %}On August 8, 2020 at 17:40 local time, a Cessna 172 experienced a hard landing at Centennial Airport in Englewood, Colorado. The aircraft was substantially damaged and there were no injuries.<br /><br />The student pilot was on a local solo flight when he misjudged the landing flare and the airplane ballooned before it landed hard on the runway. The student pilot stated that the airplane bounced at least 3 times, with each subsequent bounce harder than the previous bounce. The student pilot reported that he eventually lost directional control of the airplane before it came to a stop in the grass area beside the runway. The airplaneâ€™s lower fuselage structure was buckled resulting in substantial damage. The student pilot did not report any mechanical malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.<br /><br />The National Transportation Safety Board determined the probable cause of this accident to be: the student pilot misjudged the landing flare which resulted in a loss of control and a hard bounced landing.{% endraw %}
