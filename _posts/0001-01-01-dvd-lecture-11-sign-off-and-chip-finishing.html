{% raw %}Bar-Ilan University 83-612: Digital VLSI Design<br />This is Lecture 11 of the Digital VLSI Design course at Bar-Ilan University. In this course, I cover the basics of Chip Implementation, from designing the logic (RTL) to providing a layout ready for fabrication (GDS).<br /><br />Lecture 11 wraps up the RTL to GDS flow with the extra steps that are needed to take a design that has finished place and route and prepare it for tape-out. Part 1 of the lecture focuses on the various margins and issues in sign-off timing, such as OCV, PBA, and Aging.<br />Lecture slides can be found on my faculty web site at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.eng.biu.ac.il/temanad/digital-vlsi-design/">http://www.eng.biu.ac.il/temanad/digital-vlsi-design/</a><br /><br />All rights reserved: <br />Prof. Adam Teman<br />Emerging nanoscaled Integrated Circuits and Systems (EnICS) Labs<br />Faculty of Engineering, Bar-Ilan University{% endraw %}
