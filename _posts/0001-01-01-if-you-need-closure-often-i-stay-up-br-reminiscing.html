{% raw %}Often I stay up,<br />reminiscing on old memories.<br />Not because I want them back,<br />but because I miss the emotions I felt in those moments.<br /><br />Our minds, they work in ways of happiness —<br />only choosing to remember the good.<br />Which explains why I can’t forget much of us.<br /><br />But now I must let you go.<br />I wish you well, on your own journey,<br />one that I am no longer part of anymore,<br />and that’s okay.<br /><br />I thank God every day,<br />that out of all his creations, <br />he allowed me <br />to experience the beautiful soul<br />that is you.<br />And case the day comes<br />where we will never speak to each other again,<br />I just want to say,<br />I am glad that I met you.<br />I am thankful to have created these memories that will live inside of me forever. <br /><br />Life is like a blink of an eye, <br />and before you know it, it’s gone. <br />So thank you. <br /><br />Thank you for helping guide me in a way <br />I’ve never been shown before.<br />For putting all these broken pieces together, slowly, <br />one by one,<br />asking for nothing in return, <br />only love and time.<br /><br />And I’m sorry that my love wasn’t enough.<br />I promised to give you the world <br />but only gave you a half.<br />but if there’s one thing I’ve learned from us, <br />it is to love without condition,<br />and I promise to carry that with me forever.<br /><br />I will not ruin you in my mind<br />and I will not feel resentment.<br />I will only remember your contribution to my life nothing short of beautiful.<br />I only wish that you figure yourself out,<br />and love yourself <br />as much as you’ve loved me.<br /><br />I promise to make use of the love you have so willingly poured into me,<br />because not every person is so willing to give a piece of themselves.<br />And although i am not satisfied with the way things ended<br />i will accept it, learn from it, and grow<br />because now I am finally ready to let go.<br />this is my closure.{% endraw %}
