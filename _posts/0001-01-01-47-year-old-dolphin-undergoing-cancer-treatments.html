{% raw %}Since September, Lucky, a bottlenose dolphin, has been undergoing testing and treatment at Brookfield Zoo in Illinois. Veterinarians there say the 500-pound dolphin has squamous cell carcinoma, a fairly common type of skin and oral cancer that can affect both humans and animals. They are aggressively treating his cancer with cryotherapy, applying extreme cold to an area in order to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue.{% endraw %}
