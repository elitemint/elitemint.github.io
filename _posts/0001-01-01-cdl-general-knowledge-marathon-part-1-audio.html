{% raw %}This CDL General Knowledge Marathon (part 1) contains 150 questions that are very similar to the official DMV CDL test.<br /><br />Got a couple of hours to spare? This CDL General Knowledge Marathon is a super-challenging study tool that contains a mix of all 287 questions that we have available for this endorsement. We suggest you attempt this one after you have practiced the state’s “regular” tests, but before the “Exam”. Good luck!<br /><br />I hope this video helps you in some way.<br />If you would like to help support my work by making a donation, please consider using &quot;donationalerts&quot; to make a donation:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.donationalerts.com/r/alex...">https://www.donationalerts.com/r/alex...</a><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Download for free Commercial Driver License Handbook (US)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3uT7iInTx1mT2JWOFR1WjdMUzg?resourcekey=0-bfVJA2poJNh-p-9IV_1B7g&amp;usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3uT7iInTx1mT2JWOFR1WjdMUzg?resourcekey=0-bfVJA2poJNh-p-9IV_1B7g&amp;usp=sharing</a>{% endraw %}
