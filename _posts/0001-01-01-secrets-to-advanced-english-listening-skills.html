It's true.<br /><br />I sometimes find it difficult to understand:<br />- when on the phone<br />- when talking to people with accents I'm not used to<br />- when watching movies<br />- and when listening to music<br /><br />This is going to happen to you. You'll never reach a stage where you understand everything.<br />But it's important to improve so that you can understand more. Here is how:<br /><br />1. Improve your vocabulary and grammar: the more you know, the more you'll understand. Search for &quot;input To Fluency&quot; to learn how to do this.<br />2. Listen as much as possible: get used to the way people speak. You can listen while doing other things.<br />3. What you listen to is important: find audio that is enjoyable, specific to you, and comprehensible. I recommend audiobooks that have been adapted for English learners (graded readers)<br />4. Work on your pronunciation: if you can make the sounds in English, you'll better understand them when you hear them.<br />5. Have natural conversations: this is the best type of listening practice but it's more expensive and harder to find.<br /><br />I encourage you to try these methods. Start today. Commit to doing more in English. Enjoy the journey.<br /><br />Hope you enjoyed this! Please subscribe if you're new!{% endraw %}
