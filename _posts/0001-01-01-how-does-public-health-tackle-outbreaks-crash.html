{% raw %}Public health activities are all the ways society coordinates to deliver better health to people. That may sound super broad, and it is, so in this episode of Crash Course Outbreak Science, we'll take a look at public health works to prevent outbreaks. We'll learn what public health is and what public health agencies do, look at the three tiers of public health responses, and revisit one of our favorite fictional cities to see these responses in action.<br /><br />This episode of Crash Course Outbreak Science was produced by Complexly in partnership with Operation Outbreak and the Sabeti Lab at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard—with generous support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.<br /><br />Sources:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/determinants-of-health">https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/determinants-of-health</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rcn.org.uk/clinical-topics/public-health/the-role-of-nursing-staff-in-public-health/managing-outbreaks">https://www.rcn.org.uk/clinical-topics/public-health/the-role-of-nursing-staff-in-public-health/managing-outbreaks</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-40ac92b1-1750-4e86-9936-2cda6b0acb3f">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-40ac92b1-1750-4e86-9936-2cda6b0acb3f</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329438/9789241516839-eng.pdf">http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329438/9789241516839-eng.pdf</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/05/health/coronavirus-swiss-cheese-infection-mackay.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/05/health/coronavirus-swiss-cheese-infection-mackay.html</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/science-maths-technology/science/public-health-approaches-infectious-disease/content-section-3.2">https://www.open.edu/openlearn/science-maths-technology/science/public-health-approaches-infectious-disease/content-section-3.2</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/science-maths-technology/science/public-health-approaches-infectious-disease/content-section-3.3#:~:text=Medical%20treatment%20to%20prevent%20the,the%20spread%20of%20infectious%20disease.">https://www.open.edu/openlearn/science-maths-technology/science/public-health-approaches-infectious-disease/content-section-3.3#:~:text=Medical%20treatment%20to%20prevent%20the,the%20spread%20of%20infectious%20disease.</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.iwh.on.ca/what-researchers-mean-by/primary-secondary-and-tertiary-prevention">https://www.iwh.on.ca/what-researchers-mean-by/primary-secondary-and-tertiary-prevention</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/basics/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/basics/index.html</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/winnablebattles/report/foodsafety.html">https://www.cdc.gov/winnablebattles/report/foodsafety.html</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/training/publichealth101/documents/introduction-to-surveillance.pdf">https://www.cdc.gov/training/publichealth101/documents/introduction-to-surveillance.pdf</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/22/science/11SCI-VIRUS-CURVE1/11SCI-VIRUS-TRACKER1-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp">https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/22/science/11SCI-VIRUS-CURVE1/11SCI-VIRUS-TRACKER1-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp</a><br /><br />***<br />Watch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! <br />Download here for Apple Devices: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/3d4eyZo">https://apple.co/3d4eyZo</a><br />Download here for Android Devices: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ">https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ</a><br /><br />Crash Course is on Patreon!
