First, by the Native Americans, who have left their marks through pictographs and petroglyphs. The US Army came through in 1886, and in 2000, it was paved to protect the rock art from dust.<br /><br />Dozens of homesteads, way stations, and ranches were built in the late 1800s, early 1900s. One of which was Utah’s cattle Barron, Preston Nutter, who had the largest cattle operation between 1898 to 1936.
