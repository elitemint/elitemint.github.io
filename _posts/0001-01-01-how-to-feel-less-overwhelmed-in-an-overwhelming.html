{% raw %}Has 2020 left you feeling overwhelmed?<br /><br />You’re not alone. This entire year has felt like a series of unfortunate events that have left people feeling overwhelmed, anxious, and frustrated. In this episode, I address the overwhelm that we’re experiencing head-on. <br /><br />Tune in and learn why performative leadership is detrimental to our growth as a collective, why showing up in your overwhelmed state is a disservice to you and your audience, how to continue to lead when you’re feeling all the feels, and 4 steps to becoming less overwhelmed in an overwhelming world.<br /><br />PS. I am opening the doors to next year’s Thought Leader Collective early!
