{% raw %}I'm an artist that brings history back to life by creating famous figures from the past in the modern day, as well as creating facial reconstructions. Nefertiti has one of the most famous faces of the ancient world. Her bust has fascinated millions and inspired a love of Egyptology and Egyptian history in many. What did Nefertiti do? What is her legacy? Do we have her mummy? Is the Berlin bust fake? Finally, what did she really look like? We will take a look at some facial reconstructions together.<br /><br />Find me here:<br />Instagram: @Royalty_Now_<br />Tik Tok: @RoyaltyNow<br />Etsy: Etsy.com/Shop/RoyaltyNow<br />Patreon: Patreon.com/RoyaltyNow<br />RoyaltyNowStudios.com<br /><br />Research Credit: Anna May Writing <br />Editing Credit: Jordan Segovia<br /><br />0:00 Introduction<br />0:45 Nefertiti's Life and History<br />4:27 Nefertiti's Mummy?<br />5:03 Nefertiti's Ethnicity<br />6:07 Statues and Depictions of Nefertiti<br />8:28 The Berlin Bust<br />8:58 Is the Berlin Bust Authentic?<br />10:38 Statue Reconstructions<br />11:48 Closing<br /><br />This video creation and final image are ©Royalty Now.<br /><br />Research Sources: <br />J.
