{% raw %}Tun Mustapha Tower is a 122 metre, 30-story glass tower in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia. It was built in 1976 by Mori Building Company, a Japanese builder. The building was formerly named Yayasan Sabah Tower as it housed Yayasan Sabah, a state-sponsored foundation to promote education and economic development in the state. In 2001, the tower was renamed to honour Tun Datu Mustapha, a former Sabah chief minister. It is the fourth tallest building in Borneo after the 132-metre tall Sabah State Administrative Centre, 128-metre tall Harrington Suites and the 126-metre tall Wisma Sanyan in Sibu. There is a revolving floor on the 18th floor, which slowly spins to give a complete view of Likas Harbour. It makes one 360 degree rotation per hour.{% endraw %}
