{% raw %}SCP Orientation is an archive of files of the SCP Foundation.<br /><br />Today we will be studying Item number SCP-419: Window to the World, Object class: Safe.<br /><br /><br />SCP-419 is a large pane of reinforced glass. One side of SCP-419 does not allow light to pass through. Instead, it displays a view of what appears to be an extradimensional urban environment. This phenomenon is only present when viewed directly by a human subject. <br /> <br />The buildings visible through SCP-419 appear similar to those of the Victorian architectural period. However, they tend to have unusual, almost imperceptible changes that make them appear warped or twisted, or occupying spaces they should not. <br /> <br />Organisms have been viewed walking, albeit only en masse due to their relatively small size. They appear to be humanoid and dark red in color. Due to their seemingly advanced level of technology, the running theory among researchers is that this is not their actual skin color, but rather their clothing.<br /> <br /> <br /><br /><br /> Proceed to begin your training.<br /> <br /><br />This video is derived from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-419">https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-419</a> and released under Creative Commons Sharealike 3.0.
