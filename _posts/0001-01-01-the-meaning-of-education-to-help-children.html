{% raw %}Every child is unique and cannot be judged by the same standards.<br /><br />We can only facilitate by their side and provide the necessary things to help them grow their own twigs and leaves.<br /><br />/////////////////////////////<br />With the hope to inspire more people to think about education for the future, Y2 proudly presents our two-part video series, The Meaning of Education.<br /><br />The videos showcase two Montessori schools located in Taiwan.  Part one: To Help Children Develop into What They Are Meant to Be displays the period from pre-school to elementary school; and Part two: To Help Adolescents Find Their Own Place exhibits the period from elementary through secondary school.<br /><br />It is our hope that these visual presentations will offer the general public a glance of Montessori education in practice and its profound meaning.<br /><br /><br />.{% endraw %}
