{% raw %}I an Employee faithful to Nanotrasen, hereby submit this shift as Shaft Miner for review regarding continued employment.<br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nsv.beestation13.com/">https://nsv.beestation13.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://affectedarc07.github.io/SS13WebMap/">https://affectedarc07.github.io/SS13WebMap/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nsv.beestation13.com/wiki/Main_Page">https://nsv.beestation13.com/wiki/Main_Page</a><br /><br />NSV13 is a prequel to SS13’s storyline. Nanotrasen has just been formed as a response to an incompetent government which has left colonies starving due to over-extension. The action takes place aboard one of Nanotrasen’s heavy cruisers. Your mission is simple: Keep the Syndicate from invading and destroying Nanotrasen on their route to conquer Sol.{% endraw %}
