{% raw %}Mineral deficiencies could be at the root of much of our fatigue and illness. The proper balance of magnesium, copper, and iron can go far in restoring our health and curing our fatigue. Today, Morley Robbins, author of &quot;Cure Your Fatigue&quot; and founder of The Root Cause Protocol, offers insights on this topic.<br /><br /><br /><br /> He explains how to achieve the proper balance of core minerals–copper, iron, and magnesium–to turn things around and restore the body’s balance. And he discusses where these minerals are found to incorporate them into the diet, absorb the critical nutrients, and improve our health and energy levels.<br /><br /><br /><br /> See Morley's website: rcp123.org<br /><br /><br /><br /> Visit our website for more resources: westonaprice.org<br /><br /><br /><br /> Check out our sponsors:  Children's Health Defense, Optimal Carnivore, Better Help, One Earth Health{% endraw %}
