The Sixty-Six is essentially an electric guitar with a down-sized Jazz Bass body, but that's only part of the story. With its incredibly flexible HSS pickup configuration, you can get a huge variety of tones out of this guitar. The Player Series pickups do a great job at recreating classic Tele tones with the single-coils in the middle and neck, while the Alnico 2 humbucker in the bridge delivers more chunk when you need it most. Simple controls include a Master Volume and Master Tone knob, along with five-way blade switching. Plus, the Modern &quot;C&quot; shaped neck and vintage-style hardware make it a blast to play. With its unique vibe and versatile tone, the Alternate Reality Sixty-Six is a formidable axe worthy of any player's attention.<br /><br />Specs:<br /><br />Model Name: Fender Sixty-Six, Maple Fingerboard<br />Series: Alternate Reality Series<br />Country Of Origin: MX<br />Body: Ash<br />Body Finish: Gloss Polyester<br />Body Shape: Jazz Bass<br />Neck Material: Maple<br />Neck Finish: Gloss Polyester<br />Neck Shape: Modern &quot;C&quot;<br />Scale Length: 25.5&quot; (648 mm)<br />Fingerboard: Maple<br />Fingerboard Radius: 9.5&quot; (241 mm)<br />Number of Frets: 22<br />Frets Size: Medium Jumbo<br />String Nut: Synthetic Bone<br />Nut Width: 1.650&quot; (42 mm)<br />Position Inlays: Black Dots<br />Truss Rods: Standard<br />Bridge Pickup: Player Series Alnico 2 Humbucking<br />Middle Pickup: Player Series Alnico 5 Tele Single-Coil<br />Neck Pickup: Player Series Alnico 5 Tele Single-Coil<br />Controls: Master Volume, Master Tone<br />Pickup Switching: 5-Position Blade: Position 1.
