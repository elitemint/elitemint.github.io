{% raw %}In today's vlog we head to Walt Disney's Magic Kingdom for a Very Merriest After Hours Event! We hope this vlog will help you plan your night at the party! We started our night a couple of hours before the event started and we took a look at some holiday merch and tried to find some food to eat. It was hard to find during the fireworks and before the special after hours event started. But we tried the Mr. Toad’s Brat Burger and it wasn’t as bad as people were saying. Then we tried some of the free hot chocolate and cookies before heading over to get our spot for the Christmas parade. It was so nice to finally have a full parade!! We also got to see Minnie’s Wonderful Christmastime Fireworks Show, which was so so good! We ended our night by watching the Mickey &amp; Minnie’s Very Merry Memories stage show. We had so much fun at the party and it really felt like we were getting so much closer to having the regular Mickey’s Very Merry Christmas Party back soon! We hope you enjoyed hanging out with us at Disney’s Magic Kingdom tonight! Thank you for watching and we’ll see you tomorrow with a new vid!<br /><br />For more info about the Very Merriest After Hours Special Event!- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/events-tours/magic-kingdom/disney-very-merriest-after-hours/">https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/events-tours/magic-kingdom/disney-very-merriest-after-hours/</a><br /><br />Other vids you might like!- <br />Mickey’s Very Merry Christmas Party 2019!- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUoaFSWH8sY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUoaFSWH8sY</a><br />Christmas Eve at Disney World- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoLt4E3awZk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoLt4E3awZk</a><br />Disney Springs Christmas Tree Trail- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dFIb74Jjog">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dFIb74Jjog</a><br />Christmas Party on a sold out night at Magic Kingdom- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSeG0v_mVoY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSeG0v_mVoY</a><br />Daytime in the park on a Disney Christmas Party day- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV99hE2294A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV99hE2294A</a><br />Christmas Eve at Disney's Typhoon Lagoon water park- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZx6uIzLwYM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZx6uIzLwYM</a><br />12 Days of Christmas Hot Dog challenge at Disney- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ttDbLlKtYo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ttDbLlKtYo</a><br />Christmas Day at Disney World and a VIP tour- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eyMQ9AozCg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eyMQ9AozCg</a><br />Christmas at Disney's Animal Kingdom- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvRtFaaFJ8I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvRtFaaFJ8I</a><br /><br />TheTimTracker T-Shirts are now available at <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://timtracker.com/shop">https://timtracker.com/shop</a><br /><br />Affiliate links to the camera equipment we use:<br />Sony ZV-1: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/32Gxr25">https://amzn.to/32Gxr25</a><br />Deity V-Mic D4 Duo: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3msvZbL">https://amzn.to/3msvZbL</a><br />Sony a6600 w/ 18-135 Lens: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2FHHP11">https://amzn.to/2FHHP11</a><br />Sigma 16mm f/1.4: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/35LqBdz">https://amzn.to/35LqBdz</a><br />Canon G7X Mark2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2CxCaqD">http://amzn.to/2CxCaqD</a><br />Sony AX53: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2EPn3XO">http://amzn.to/2EPn3XO</a><br />Sony A7Sii: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2CmZPqk">http://amzn.to/2CmZPqk</a><br />Sony A7iii: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2PLWcBh">https://amzn.to/2PLWcBh</a><br />Zeiss Batis f/2.8/18mm Lens: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2H1lozy">http://amzn.to/2H1lozy</a><br />Sony 28-70mm Lens: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2lOzo6d">http://amzn.to/2lOzo6d</a><br />Tamron f/2.8 28-75mm Lens: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2PN7LrY">https://amzn.to/2PN7LrY</a><br />GoPro Hero 5 Black: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2lPirIH">http://amzn.to/2lPirIH</a><br />Rode Smart Lav+: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2GRz7wo">https://amzn.to/2GRz7wo</a><br />Rode Stereo VideoMic Pro: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2HdDzoG">https://amzn.to/2HdDzoG</a><br />Zoom H1n Audio Recorder: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2GSemwC">https://amzn.to/2GSemwC</a><br />Mefoto Roadtrip Tripod: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2BPp9IY">http://amzn.to/2BPp9IY</a><br /><br />Hello, I am TheTimTracker.
