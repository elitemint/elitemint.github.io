{% raw %}Hello everyone and welcome to Kaunas - the second largest city in Lithuania. I'm so exited to make this video because I grew up in Kaunas and want to show you all what the city has to offer. <br /><br />Some of the famous places are: Kaunas gothic old town and centre,  Pažaislis monastery and Kaunas reservoir with a yacht club, old city funiculars, numerous museums and galleries including museum of Lithuania's most famous painter and composer M. K. Čiurlionis, and a quirky Devil's museum. In Kaunas you can also learn a lot about soviet past from its unique shops and cafes still left in the centre, and 9 fort museum which is infamous for its role in the second world war. <br /><br />There is so much more in Kaunas, see the video to find out!<br /><br />---<br /><br />I'm Justina and I'm travelling around all 60 municipalities of Lithuania, a small country in the north east of Europe. <br /><br />Disclaimer: None of my videos are sponsored, I choose to visit each of places mentioned based on my own research of the region and my interest. <br /><br />Join me in the trip and see Lithuania - subscribe for more videos!{% endraw %}
