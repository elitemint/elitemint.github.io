{% raw %}THIS WAS A BAD IDEA. ONE OF THEM TRIED TO BREAK MY ARM!<br /><br />Yo Yo Yo certi fam!!!<br /><br />So this Is actually the first video I've uploaded since we hit 500k. That is insane and I thank everyone of you so much for the continuous support.<br /><br />This video is a bit too much and it got way out of hand, to the point where I felt like retaliating... so I won't be going back there for that reason. (That takes the fun out of it) ANYWAY.....<br /><br />It was an idea that you guys had, so I did it. WHAT'S NEXT? <br /><br />CERTIFAM MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://everythingcerti.com">https://everythingcerti.com</a><br /><br />MAKE SURE YOU ARE SUBSCRIBED!
