However, I added a secret plugin that allowed me to get every block I looked at when I held shift! This meant anytime, I could simply startholding shift, and I would pick up every block I looked at, including bedorck! This was such an OP video idea! Who will win this minecraft manhunt challenge? Let us know who you think will win down below! This minecraft challenge was hilarious and funny!<br /><br />If you've read this far down, Please Smash Like!<br /><br />Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. Or Minecraft But OP Items / Random Enchants / Structures like that too. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin<br /><br />#Minecraft #MinecraftManhunt #MinecraftChallenge{% endraw %}
