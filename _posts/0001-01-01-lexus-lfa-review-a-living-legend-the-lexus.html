{% raw %}The Lexus LFA (Now ~$1,000,000 CAD, ~$800,000 USD) is just about everyone’s favourite supercar - and it’s no surprise as to why. The handbuilt naturally aspirated V10 with its meticulously engineered exhaust note. The mind-bendingly fast sequential gearbox. The carbon fibre infused chassis. There are so many reasons why the LFA holds a special place in the hearts of enthusiasts all over the world. But will it live up to the hype and be the exception to the saying ‘don’t meet your heroes’? Watch as Thomas and James attempt to pick their jaws up off the floor and review this automotive legend.
