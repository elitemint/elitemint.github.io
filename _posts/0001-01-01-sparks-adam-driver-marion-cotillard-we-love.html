{% raw %}We Love Each Other So Much | From &quot;Annette&quot; <br />Listen to the single here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://annette.lnk.to/WLEOSM">https://annette.lnk.to/WLEOSM</a><br />Pre-order the album on vinyl: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://annette.lnk.to/highlights">https://annette.lnk.to/highlights</a> <br /><br />ABOUT ANNETTE <br /><br />Annette, the much-anticipated new film from LEOS CARAX, is set to open the 74th Cannes Film Festival on 6 July 2021 and will go on general release in France on the same date. Based on an original story and music by Ron and Russell Mael, the brothers behind the flamboyant band SPARKS, ANNETTE began life as an (unreleased) album but was transformed into a musical film after they met Carax. Having successfully maintained a five-decade-long career as one of the world’s most innovative and creative bands, it comes as no surprise that their collaboration with the visionary French director has resulted in a unique piece of film-making. The original soundtrack to ANNETTE, with lyrics co-written by SPARKS and LEOS CARAX and music composed and performed by SPARKS, features vocals from the stars of the film: Adam Driver (Henry), Marion Cotillard (Ann) and Simon Helberg (The Conductor). <br /><br />About Annette, SPARKS says: “The characters live and breathe through the sensibility, tone, and lyrics of the music. In Annette, we set out to have virtually all the dialogue sung. It was a huge challenge, but one we are extremely proud of.“ <br /><br /><br />► SUBSCRIBE to our channel for more:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lnk.to/sonysoundtracks">https://lnk.to/sonysoundtracks</a>  <br />► Follow Milan Records: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://lnk.to/milanrecords">http://lnk.to/milanrecords</a>  <br />► More Soundtracks from Milan Records: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://milanrecords.com">https://milanrecords.com</a>   <br /><br />LYRICS: <br /><br />We love each other so much   <br />We love each other so much  <br />We’re scoffing at logic  <br />This wasn’t the plan  <br />We love each other so much  <br /><br />We love each other so much  <br />We love each other so much  <br />Counterintuitive, baby  <br />And yet we remain  <br />We love each other so much  <br /><br />(Repeat)  <br /><br />We love each other so much<br />We love each other so much  <br />So hard to explain it  <br />So hard to explain  <br />We love each other so much  <br /><br />We love each other so much  <br />We love each other so much  <br />Speak soft when you say it  <br />Speak soft when you say  <br />We love each other so much  <br /><br />(Repeat)  <br /><br />So much  <br />So much  <br />So much  <br />So much…  <br /><br />#Sparks #Annette #LeosCarax{% endraw %}
