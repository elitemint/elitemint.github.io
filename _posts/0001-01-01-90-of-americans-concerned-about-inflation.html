The White House and Federal Reserve have erred in calling inflation &quot;transitory,&quot; which has proved to be anything but that. Consumer sentiment tumbled to the crisis lows in October as inflation expectations marched higher. <br /><br />In response to rising prices, respondents said they would begin to cut back on spending. About half of them said they would reduce dining at restaurants or take-out meals (48%). About 30% said they would keep their current technology. It also found other actions respondents said they would cut back:<br /><br />budget food (29%)<br /><br />purchase less clothing (29%)<br /><br />put off home renovations (23%)<br /><br />cancel/put off travel plans (20%)<br /><br />drive less (13%)<br /><br />The facts are that consumer prices soared 6.2% YoY in October, far higher than the +5.9% YoY expected and accelerating from September's 5.4% YoY; that was the highest print since June 1990{% endraw %}
