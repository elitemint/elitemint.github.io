{% raw %}Doulbe Ciri Kolgrim is a Gwent Deck where the game gets brutal in all the fun ways. The goal is to win round 1 with Snowdrop and your leader ability. Then play into round 2. Your goal is to clog while setting up Ffion and two OG Ciris (one of these copies is Letho). That means in round 3, you have card advantage so Kolgrim doesn't need protection. You can just play him safely and win the game.<br /><br />Now what typically happened was a wild ride of everything going wrong yet somehow it all worked out. The plan was achieved in a couple games but there was a lot of improv along this journey. The deck was a ton to play and this might be my longest video of 2021. So get excited!<br /><br />Decklist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.playgwent.com/decks/f8ac0c168cc826ce8ddc68f7c6e9e943">http://www.playgwent.com/decks/f8ac0c168cc826ce8ddc68f7c6e9e943</a><br /><br />0:00 MO Frost<br />9:07 NR Shieldwall<br />20:07 ST Nature's Gift<br />31:35 NG Double Cross<br />43:42 NG Imposter<br />54:10 ST Nature's Gift 2<br />01:06:02 NG Double Cross 2<br />01:14:34 ST Dwarves<br /><br />#gwent<br />--<br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/plaintalkjon">https://www.twitch.tv/plaintalkjon</a><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/ZUuAMvHa2n">https://discord.gg/ZUuAMvHa2n</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/plaintalkjon">https://twitter.com/plaintalkjon</a><br />PlainTalkMoney: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClEeiNdd0vLdu2FWPtpWX7A">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClEeiNdd0vLdu2FWPtpWX7A</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/PlainTalkJon">https://www.patreon.com/PlainTalkJon</a><br />Donate: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://streamlabs.com/plaintalkjon/tip">https://streamlabs.com/plaintalkjon/tip</a><br />Streaming Schedule: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/plaintalkjon/schedule">https://www.twitch.tv/plaintalkjon/schedule</a>{% endraw %}
