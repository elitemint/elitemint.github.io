â€˜Overseasâ€™ by Young Adz, Dirtbike LB and Central Cee:<br /><br />[Chorus: Young Adz]<br />The year has just started and right now I'm looking for cribs overseas<br />I'm giving my lady some driving lessons in a hundred-grand Jeep<br />When you see me in public, no photos, man, I need some privacy please<br />Good girl, she just sat on my face now she's saying her legs have gone weak<br />Bad, bad, see the jakes outside now I'm flushing the work down the toilet<br />Mad, mad, Richard Mille<br />A crib by the port and it's imported, sad, sad<br />If you knew the truth 'bout that n*gga then it would get awkward<br />And I know that n*gga get money now<br />I am the n*gga that taught him<br /><br />[Verse 1: Young Adz]<br />Bro I get the birds in, fuck a drought<br />Worker is misbehaving, chuck him out<br />I get the money, money from her house<br />Out in a lovely, lovely country town<br />I said if you care about her, fly her out<br />Go to the Louis store and buy it now<br />I'ma keep pouring till I'm running out<br />I just hit it from the back<br />She scared, she running out<br />Ooh, young and lit<br />Money keep on coming in<br />Ooh, I keep a rock band on stand by<br />Pull up and drum that shit<br />Ooh, deep in it, ima swim<br />Hand on heart I love this chick<br />Ooh, all them n*ggas round me family<br />Love them on some brother shit<br /><br />[Verse 2: Central Cee]<br />She suck my soul, she done it like Ash Kaash<br />I keep on getting them flashbacks<br />I was OT so I had to bash<br />I almost thought about getting a cab back<br />Do it like Rico and video that<br />If we upload it, it prolly get some backlash<br />Backshot, she got the ripple effect<br />It's too tempting, I can't help but slap that (Fuck that)<br />Pull out, I don't wanna be a dad yet<br />Plan B, girl you gotta swallow that tablet<br />The way that she handle it, this one talented<br />Pum pum soaking feel like I'm paddling<br />Back come round I'm a fan of it<br />Ride on a bike one time, I'm saddling<br />Ayo, her doctor working wonders<br />Damn that's a big circumference<br />Girl wet she don't need no lube<br />On the 40th floor, you should see the view<br />She don't wanna send me her pussy on Snapchat, mad man<br />I don't wanna leak your nudes<br />How do I say it without seeming rude?<br />Huh, I just wanna see if it's cute<br />Shake that back like a video vixen<br />Dis one he don't wanna be in my tune<br />She wanna go Nobu just for the snap<br />If I pay for the tab you best eat your food<br />Word on the road is Cench get 100 a show<br />This hoe wanna see if it's true<br />Posh ting she don't wanna be with the squares no more<br />She said she wanna be with the goons<br />Thought she could hack it, not active<br />Too smokey now she wanna leave the room<br /><br />[Chorus: Young Adz]<br />The year has just started and right now I'm looking for cribs overseas<br />I'm giving my lady some driving lessons in a hundred-grand Jeep<br />When you see me in public, no photos, man, I need some privacy please<br />Good girl, she just sat on my face now she's saying her legs have gone weak<br />Bad, bad, see the jakes outside now I'm flushing the work down the toilet<br />Mad, mad, Richard Mille<br />A crib by the port and it's imported, sad, sad<br />If you knew the truth 'bout that n*gga then it would get awkward<br />And I know that n*gga get money now<br />I am the n*gga that taught him<br /><br />[Verse 3: Dirtbike LB]<br />I love the trap<br />Quarter milli on cars is never enough<br />Couple milli I put it aside<br />Cop me a villa in Mars<br />She need 10 racks for her ass<br />And bro I put that on my dargs<br />My killers still swerving the Rona but that ain't the reason for masks<br />I fill up the drum in the stick in a way<br />Spin it back like i'm Target<br />I sat in my kitchen I whip in a way<br />And I'm dropping off white with no garlic<br />It's a carousel when I'm spinning the tray<br />Hitter my flights delayed<br />I told my lil n*gga go flex in my Rollie no money to waste<br /><br />[Chorus: Young Adz]<br />The year has just started and right now I'm looking for cribs overseas<br />I'm giving my lady some driving lessons in a hundred-grand Jeep<br />When you see me in public, no photos, man, I need some privacy please<br />Good girl, she just sat on my face
