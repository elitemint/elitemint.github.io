{% raw %}The Best Back Workout When You're in a Hurry | Get Results Quickly<br /><br />This workout is great even if you're not in a hurry! Today, we'll be performing supersets/compound sets. Make sure your tempo during each exercise is nice and slow. You can keep your recovery shorter for leaning down, or if you're really in a rush. For building muscle, go heavier and take up to 3 minutes between supersets.<br /><br />Exercises mentioned:<br />1a). cable rows<br />1b). cable pullovers (on row station)<br />2a). double cable kneeling pull downs<br />2b). single handle face pulls<br />3a). supine rows<br />3b). incline pullovers<br />4). cable rope rows burnout (AMRAP set)<br /><br />For gaining muscle, go heavier and opt for 4 sets of 8-10 reps per exercise, excluding the last exercise. For leaning down, you can do more reps (12-15), if you'd like. Keep in mind that leaning down is more a function of diet :) So, if you love training heavier, go for it!<br /><br />For comprehensive workout programs, check out <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://erinsternfitness.com">http://erinsternfitness.com</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching!
