It’s finally the product that comes to address that fact that it’s as if this lineup always carried some sort of a burden. The first one launched without a Retina Display along with the third iPad that did, so that honeymoon didn’t last. Then when it did, it didn’t get refreshed for years, making the Air and Pro models with stylus support more enticing. <br /><br />Point is, I’ve spent years on Amazon’s front page wanting to buy one, but since it’s never been priced as an impulsive buy, and because Apple kept launching it along with better alternatives, it’s been like this product I know I want, but could resist.
