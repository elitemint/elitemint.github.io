Follow the link below to learn more about this program:<br />patreon.com/fitnessanytimeandanywherebyMarzena<br />THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!<br />This video is dedicated to those who struggle with back pain. Myself, at the time of making this video, had a spine surgery just 6 months before. It was a horrific experience and a long recovery process filled with ups and downs. I do feel better , but I would lie if I say I no longer have any back pain. It comes back every now and then...I guess to remind me that the problem is still there ( I herniated my disk) and that if I am not careful enough, the pain may come back. <br />So I am dedicated to spend at least 5 days a week at the pool, not only to workout ( I do Water Aerobics frequently) but also to relax and stretch. <br />These exercises ( 26 of them) are the easiest and safest for majority of people who recover from the back surgery or struggle with back pain. Please consult your doctor, before you start doing any of these. Eventually, after you receive a green light from your doctor, try these moves and it they bring you an immediate pain relief, repeat them regularly 3-5 times a week.{% endraw %}
