{% raw %}Come Monday, all indoor public places in New York that do not require proof of full vaccination for entry must implement a mask mandate, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced Friday. She called it a &quot;major action&quot; to address the worst COVID surge the state has seen in more than half a year across all of the key indicators.<br /><br />The decision was based on mounting concern of the state's weekly seven-day case rate and rising hospitalizations, Hochul said. Noncompliance comes with fines of up to $1,000 per violation. The order will be reassessed on Jan. 15. <br /><br />News 4's Linda Gaudino reports.<br /><br />#mask<br />#vaccine<br />#mandate<br />#covid<br />#nbc4ny{% endraw %}
