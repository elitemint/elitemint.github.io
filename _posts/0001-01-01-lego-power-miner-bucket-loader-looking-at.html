{% raw %}Looking at all the lego power miner vehicles lego has made, I see almost none of them would have a practical use in a mine. (None of them would even dig). What about normal equipment and systems? Well, most of those in real life are really boring. So, why not make a slightly outlandish variation of a real vehicle? So here's a bucket loader.{% endraw %}
