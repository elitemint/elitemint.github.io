{% raw %}We often think there is only one type of humour: ours. And whoever isn't laughing at our jokes has no sense of humour. Your sense of humour determines who you are and says a lot about you, your personality, your background, your values.<br />Today, diversity and inclusion are key organisational challenges. What if there is an unexpected solution to foster inclusion and improve diversity?<br />In this talk, Dr. Vanessa Marcie explains why she believes humour can provide a path to inclusion &amp; diversity in organisations. Dr. Vanessa Marci√© is the founder and CEO of Leading With Humour, an innovative consultancy and Leadership Development firm that help leaders and organisations to harness the power of humour for more productive, inclusive and funnier workplaces. <br />She is a leadership coach, international speaker, an academic and a stand-up comedian. Her research work on Humour and Leadership has been published in The Financial Times, The European Business Review, La Tribune and Harvard Business Review France. <br />She is a Fellow of the Institute of Innovation and Knowledge Exchange and a Cambridge Wo + Men's Leadership Center Associate. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
