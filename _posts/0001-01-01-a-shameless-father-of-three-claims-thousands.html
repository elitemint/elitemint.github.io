{% raw %}The show follows immigrants claiming UK welfare payments for their children, even though they live in their home countries. The show follows some of the 20,000 immigrants thought to be claiming these incorrect benefits. First we meet Ion, a shameless father-of-three who is determined to claim thousands of pounds. <br /><br />He heads to his home country Romania, to check how the renovation of his home is going. Evita gets benefits for her son living back in Poland, because the father of her child lives and works in Bristol. She owns her own restaurant so the benefits are used just for her son.<br /><br />Like our content?
