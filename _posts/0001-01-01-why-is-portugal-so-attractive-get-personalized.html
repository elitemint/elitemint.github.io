This destination only seems to be growing in popularity, and here are my thoughts why.<br /><br />Today, I’m vlogging from Lisbon Portugal, and I came here for Solana event. <br /><br />So, what it is that Portugal is doing and why are they having success with all these young and successful people? <br />First of all Portugal is quite and open and welcoming culture. This country is quite artistic, and you can feel that spirit on every corner. Also it’s quite welcoming for people from LGBTQ+ community, which is a huge plus! <br />Second, even in the current circumstances Portugal is quite open. We’ve hosted an event recently, and there have been many such things going on in here. There are no restrictions in that regard, and it’s quite refreshing. <br /><br />But what’s the most important thing, that attracts our audience to Portugal? You guessed it right - taxes! <br />Portugal offers quite appealing tax regime, they have NHR program, crypto is taxed differently, and this is one of the main reasons why many successful business people are moving here. <br />Portugal is extremely attractive for builders! <br /><br />At the same time it’s quite easy to relocate to Portugal, they have many different residency schemes. They have famous D7 visa, which is probably the easiest residency visa In the entire EU, and of course, they offer Golden Visa for high rollers. This is another extremely popular visa. <br />Golden visa is a great path to Portuguese citizenship, gives you the access to EU and the Schengen zone, without strict physical residency requirements. You don’t have to spend too much time in the country in order to keep your golden visa residency, and to obtain a passport down the line. <br /><br />On thing that separates Portugal from many other desirable countries In Europe, such as Bulgaria or Estonia is certainly weather. Portugal offers great weather all year around: warm summers and mild winters. <br /><br />Will Portugal remain such an amazing option in the future? We will see. <br />They have quite a bit of socialist agenda, paired with the lack of funds, so it might be that the amazing tax situation doesn’t last for much longer. <br />However, at the moment Portugal remains one of the most attractive options for builders and crypto entrepreneurs. <br /><br /><br />Who are we and what do we do?<br /><br />We are Offshore Citizen team. We help people become global: get a second passport, set up a second residency, pay less taxes, do banking abroad, etc.<br /><br />We have lots of interesting articles on different topics, we have relevant information up to date. <br /><br /><br />Author: Michael Rosmer<br /><br />Feel free to join our community!<br /><br />Don’t forget to subscribe to our channel<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZDToCpuHc4kEHDurkQpVPg?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZDToCpuHc4kEHDurkQpVPg?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />#Portugal #Lisbon{% endraw %}
