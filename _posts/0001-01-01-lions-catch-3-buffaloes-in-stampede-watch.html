{% raw %}Watch this nonstop and dramatic back and forth action that occurred when a pride of 30 lions targeted a thirsty herd of buffalo.

We were standing on the edge of a cliff with no other people around, with no idea that we were going to see something extremely rare!”<br /><br /><br />“While at the waterhole, a dramatic back and forth battle occurred between the lions and buffaloes, the adults were doing their best to rescue the calves and after about 10 minutes at the waterhole the buffaloes ran back up the hillside.”<br /><br /><br />“As the buffalo ran up the hillside, the two male lions left their initial kills to chase the wounded calves. The two calves who had been rescued by the herd were once again the target and the two male lions went in for the kill this time the adult buffaloes were not able to rescue them.”<br /><br /><br />“My adrenalin was running and I got quite emotional but this is nature and it happens every day. It is just extremely rare to get footage of it.”<br /><br /><br />“My wife and I have been on 8 safaris arranged by Africa Adventure Company. On three of our trips, we visited Mana Pools. In 150 days on safari, we had never seen a lion kill. On day 3 of this safari, we saw more than 4 lion kills in less than 7 minutes! It was incredibly rare! Although, only 1 successful”<br /><br /><br />“We took a big chance traveling during the pandemic and it was quite a logistical challenge getting from the USA to Zimbabwe, but, once we were there, we practically had the national park to ourselves. Thank you to our travel agent Mark Nolting from Africa Adventure Company for helping us organize this incredible safari.”<br /><br /><br />BOOK YOUR TRIP TO KRUGER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/BookatKruger">http://bit.ly/BookatKruger</a><br /><br /><br /><br />To license the footage: <br /><br />Contact@LatestSightings.com<br /><br /><br /><br />Get some of our exclusive specials at the Kruger National Park (Free nights): <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.latestsightings.com/specials">https://www.latestsightings.com/specials</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Snapchat: LatestSightings<br /><br />Twitter &amp; Instagram: @LatestKruger<br /><br /><br /><br />For live wildlife sightings in the Kruger National Park: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.latestsightings.com/">http://www.latestsightings.com/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />And like our Facebook page for great sightings and photos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/latestsightingskruger">https://www.facebook.com/latestsightingskruger</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Subscribe to us on YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/LatestSightings">http://www.youtube.com/LatestSightings</a>{% endraw %}
