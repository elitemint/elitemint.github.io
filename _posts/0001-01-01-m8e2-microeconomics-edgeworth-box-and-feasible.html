{% raw %}In this episode we introduce one the most important concepts of general equilibrium analysis: The Edgeworth Box.<br /><br />Important Note for Navigating Lecture Videos: Watching lecture videos with a proper order is important for effective learning. This is true because the concepts in each video is built over the ones that are introduced in “previous” videos. For this reason, I strongly recommend you watch the videos through playlists. Alternatively, you may visit my website <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ozyurtselcuk.com/microeconomic-theory">https://www.ozyurtselcuk.com/microeconomic-theory</a> for a recommended course outline.<br /><br />This recommended course outline offers an ordered list of lecture videos, which I follow in my Microeconomic theory courses. Depending on your interest and objectives, you may prefer to skip some of the videos. For more user-friendly navigation I’ve tagged each video in this list by “Intermediate” or “Advanced.” <br /><br />Most of the videos require some background in microeconomics (e.g., introduction to microeconomics). If you are looking for in depth understanding of the concepts of Microeconomic theory or a second-year college student, then you should watch videos that are tagged “Intermediate.” If you want some extra challenge, a fourth-year college student, or a Master student, then you can watch all the videos on this list, including the ones that are tagged “Advanced.”<br /><br />If you are a PhD level student, then the videos on this list would be perfect resources for refreshing your knowledge or catching up with the rest of the class.
