{% raw %}I beat @FreshandFit's copyright strike attack. I got a very long email from YouTube last night.  Guess what it says.... Background:  @Aba &amp; Preach first rang the alarm on this issue of @FreshandFit misusing and abusing @YouTube's copyright violation detection system to SILENCE YouTube content creators.  @Aba &amp; Preach noted that both large and small content creators have been significantly affected.  Some of the affected included:@Spencer Cornelia, @JAMARI, @Playback, @Kevin Ray Wilder, and others. IF YOU KNOW ANYONE POSSIBLY AFFECTED, PLEASE SHARE THIS VIDEO AND LET US TALK ABOUT THIS AS A COMMUNITY! If you also have been affected by @FreshandFit's abuse of the copyright system, PLEASE LET @YouTube Creators AND @YouTube KNOW IMMEDIATELY!<br /><br />Want to learn how I make well over $25,000/month on YouTube?
