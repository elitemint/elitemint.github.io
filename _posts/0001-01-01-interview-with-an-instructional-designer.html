{% raw %}Education is at a crucial point of change. The COVID-19 crisis has hit Trinidad and Tobago and the Caribbean on a level that is unprecedented. <br /><br />Cultures and systems that were based on class attendance and in-person instruction are now having to grapple with the fact that education can no longer continue the way it did. The scramble to move education online has been a massive undertaking given that material designed as handouts in print, must now be created for video, online download and Zoom instruction.<br /><br />Yet, one entrepreneur and designer who has already been ahead of the curve is Kevin Charles, at Academy of Higher Education. He's an instructional designer who, from the beginning, has shaped his educational institution as a blended learning approach. And during these times, his years of experience now give him the edge in technology, online course design and being able to manage through the crisis.<br /><br />Here, I share a few words with him to understand his vision, how we designed his business and how he continues to help students prepare for life-changing exams in a time like COVID-19 and 2020.<br /><br />-----<br />Stefan De Las is a growing UX Designer and Small Business Enthusiast focused on helping entrepreneurs create better products and services for their customers and awesome experiences for their audiences. <br /><br />He shares practical projects with real challenges and unknown results. He also interviews experts and owners who try to do things differently.<br /><br />Get in touch at:<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.stefandelas.com">https://www.stefandelas.com</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/stefan.las/">https://www.facebook.com/stefan.las/</a><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefan-de-las/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefan-de-las/</a><br /><br />#onlinelearning #smallbusiness #trinidadandtobago #interviewwitha #covid-19 #coronavirus #instructionaldesign #education #caribbean{% endraw %}
