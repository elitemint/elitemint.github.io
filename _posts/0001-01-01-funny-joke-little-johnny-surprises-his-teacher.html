{% raw %}Funny Joke - Little Johnny Surprises His Teacher With This Answer<br /><br />😂 The Joke 😂<br /><br />A teacher asks her class, “If there are five birds sitting on a fence and you shoot one of them, how many will be left?” She calls on Little Johnny to answer.<br />He replies, “There are none left,—they all fly away with the first gun shot.” The teacher replies, “The correct answer is four, but I like your thinking.”<br />Then Little Johnny says, “I have a question for you. There are three women sitting on a bench having ice cream. One is delicately licking the sides of the triple scoop of ice cream.<br />The second is gobbling down the top and sucking the cone. The third is biting off the top of the ice cream. Which one is married?”<br />The teacher, blushing a great deal, replies, “Well, I suppose the one that’s gobbled down the top and sucked the cone.” To which Little Johnny replies,<br />“The correct answer is the one with the wedding ring on, but I like your thinking.”<br /><br />If you're enjoying the Jokes, please don't forget to subscribe!<br />🔔 Turn on notifications so you don't miss a new video! 🔔<br /><br />#jokes #funny #humor{% endraw %}
