{% raw %}For my upcoming show in museum Heerenveen, October until December 2018, the works of the Eco Cathedral will be exhibited in total. The Eco Cathedral is a special place in Mildam, Netherlands, and was created by Louis le Roy. With this video I hope to show the viewer where inspiration of the place and my work came together.{% endraw %}
