{% raw %}In this film study, we analyze Tyson Fury's dirty boxing tactics that worked so well against Deontay Wilder. Tyson Fury’s 3rd and final fight against Deontay Wilder was nothing short of spectacular, capping off one of the greatest trilogies in heavyweight history.  <br /><br />The first time I broke down Fury’s style, I focused on how he stifled an opponent’s offense by constantly interrupting their rhythm, feinting every time they tried to enter into an exchange. I only briefly touched on how Fury used wrestling tactics to dirty box when he was ready to end a fight, but since he put on a total masterclass on these tactics in his last fight against Wilder, I think it’s time we delve a little deeper. <br /><br />Aggressive Defense: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.modernmartialartist.com/downloads/head-movement-blocks-counters/">http://www.modernmartialartist.com/downloads/head-movement-blocks-counters/</a><br />Footwork Wins Fights: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.modernmartialartist.com/downloads/footwork-wins-fights/">http://www.modernmartialartist.com/downloads/footwork-wins-fights/</a><br />Principles of Power: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.modernmartialartist.com/downloads/power-of-the-pros/">http://www.modernmartialartist.com/downloads/power-of-the-pros/</a><br />Mortal Weapons The Fight Comic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Mortal-Weapons-David-Christian-ebook/dp/B07T4X4W1K/">https://www.amazon.com/Mortal-Weapons-David-Christian-ebook/dp/B07T4X4W1K/</a>{% endraw %}
