{% raw %}This film shows the Northern provinces: Groningen, Friesland and Drenthe as well as the two Western provinces: North and South Holland, as it was over 90 years ago before 1930! More details are in the time line below.<br /><br />The quality of the original B&amp;W footage is not as good as other footage from the same source. Nevertheless, it is so unique that we decided to upload it to Youtube. The B&amp;W source has been motion-stabilized, speed-corrected, interpolated, restored, enhanced and colorized with modern A.I. video software. Because of the poor quality, the video noise and other filters had to be configured to higher settings to more drastically clean up the footage.<br /><br />Music: Spectacles Wallet and Watch<br />Source: Beeld En Geluid, A great Dutch online historic film archive.<br /><br />Timeline (draft):<br />00:00 Steam train<br />00:12 Groningen and Martini tower<br />00:18 Agrigultural activity<br />00:46 Bringing in the hay<br />00:57 National fest in Appingedam<br />01:06 Horse and buggy<br />01:40 In the woods<br />01:56 A shepherd and his sheep<br />02:26 Digging turf<br />02:40 Cutting turf sods for heating purposes<br />03:13 Black &amp; white Friesian cows (Fries stamboekvee)<br />03:41 Groninger blaarkop cow breed<br />03:52 Healthy cow<br />03:58 Healthy bull<br />04:07 Ice scating along the canals and lakes in Friesland<br />04:17 Ice masters<br />04:58 Ice sailing<br />05:37 Ice skating, maybe part of an Eleven Cities competition<br />05:42 Sailing on Friesland's many lakes<br />06:40 Train ferry near Stavoren<br />06:51 Industrious activity on the water<br />07:06 Binding wicker<br />07:18 Wicker mats as underground for a new dyke<br />07:32 Dyke construction<br />07:48 Creating a solid under layer with bolders<br />08:03 Filling barges with clay<br />08:19 Pumping clay and sand to create the dyke<br />09:23 Finishing the dyke<br />09:46 A scenic boat trip along a canal<br />10:14 Watermill<br />10:42 Scenes along a canal<br />10:44 The land is about 3 m. lower than the water level!<br />11:06 Alkmaar and its famous cheese market<br />11:27 &quot;Handjeklap&quot; to make a deal<br />11:31 Inspecting and tasting the cheese<br />11:45 Weighing the cheeses<br />11:56 Amsterdam Central Station and the famous Tea house<br />12:14 Panning towards the Damrak<br />12:30 Palace on the Dam<br />12:42 Stock exchange: Beurs van Berlage<br />12:51 Beursplein<br />12:55 Damrak looking towards the Central Station<br />13:15 Leidseplein: American Hotel, Stadsschouwburg and Hirsch building<br />13:57 Rijksmuseum<br />14:05 Designed by Kuyper<br />14:11 The Munttoren<br />14:20 One of Amsterdams wonderful canals, location-1 (?)<br />14:26 Location-2 (?)<br />14:38 Location-3 (?)<br />14:43 Location-4 (?)<br />14:52 Location-5 (?)<br />15:00 Location-6 (?)<br />15:04 Rembrandthuis, Jodenbreestraat<br />15:20 Statue of Rembrandt<br />15:28 Rembrandt's famous Nightwatch<br />15:38 Near Het Kolkje<br />15:48 Het Kolkje<br />16:01 Ditto, location-8 (?)<br />16:07 Alley, location (?)<br />16:12 Ladies trading goods<br />16:18 Old men, probably in the Jordaan quarters<br />16:26 Probably Volendam<br />16:42 Ladies in Volendam traditional costume<br />17:02 Volendam fisherman<br />17:07 Ditto<br />17:13 Ice skating on the Zuiderzee<br />17:16 Horse drawn ice sledge<br />17:21 Cycling on the ice<br />17:26 Such harsh winters are history now<br />17:37 Happy people from the island of Marken<br />17:52 Marken girl in traditional costume<br />17:59 Ditto, two Marken girls<br />18:06 Frans Hals museum in Haarlem<br />18:36 Hyacint growers<br />18:40 Fields full of flowers in the Bollenstreek<br />18:48 The famous Dutch tulips<br />19:03 Leiden, Academy building, Rapenburg near the Botanical Garden<br />19:28 A boat trip on a canal, probably in Leiden<br />19:36 Maybe the Vliet<br />19:51 Cattle along the canal (Vliet?)<br />19:56 The Hague, Houses of Parliament<br />20:12 The Ridderzaal where the Parliament meets<br />20:28 Looking towards the Ridderzaal through the pillars<br />20:45 Opening of Parliament in 1919, each year on the 3rd Tuesday in September<br />20:49 Queen Wilhelmina salutes the Royal Standard<br />20:57 She rides back to her palace<br />21:23 The Hofvijver next to the Houses of Parliament<br />21:42 Lange Vijverberg on the left<br />21:59 Vredespaleis (peace palace), funded by Carnegie<br />22:09 Judges inside the Vredespaleis<br />22:29 Ditto, outside<br />22:40 Scheveningen beach with its many wicker beach chairs<br />22:49 The old Pier right in front of the Kurhaus<br />22:58 The Pier burnt down during WWII in 1943<br />23:04 More beach scenes<br />23:10 The Hague, location (?)<br />23:25 Holland's many cyclists, probably been to the Bollenstreek<br />23:45 Canal in The Hague, maybe Mauritskade (?)<br />23:55 Removing leaves from cauliflower, location Westland (?)<br />23:59 Green houses in the Westland<br />24:06 The Nieuwe Kerk in Delft<br />24:24 Status of Hugo Grotius (Hugo De Groot)<br />24:32 Portrait of William of Orange<br />24:35 The grave of Hugo de Groot<br />24:41 The Grote Markt in Delft<br />24:44 Oude Langedijk<br />24:56 Oude Delft<br />25:06 Passing the Oude Kerk<br />25:11 Another canal in Delft, location (?)<br />25:15 Panoramic view of Rotterdam Harbour<br />26:35 Rotterdam harbor<br />30:56 Rotterdam Coolsingel<br /><br />Notes: <br />1.
