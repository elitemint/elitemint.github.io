{% raw %}Hello everyone! This week I sang Let Us Adore You from Steven Universe.<br /><br />I’M BACK AND IT FEELS GOOD<br />January was a much-needed break for me and I did absolutely nothing other than play sims and catch up on some shows and books. It was fantastic. That being said, I’m feeling totally refreshed and more than ready to jump back into YouTube and making covers! <br /><br />This song has been requested over and over and after actually listening to it, I totally dig it. Hat’s off to Rebecca Sugar and her funky harmonies. Also, I changed the last line because I wanted to and no one can stop me!!<br /><br /><br />As always, thank you all for your continued love and support! I’m so grateful for every one of you. Hope you have a fantastic week and I’ll see you next Saturday. <br />♥<br /><br />Let Us Adore You (reprise) - Steven Universe<br />➤Instrumental/Arrangement<br />Phizzy<br />[<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcV1EjpBgmIKkQRTO2g529g]">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcV1EjpBgmIKkQRTO2g529g]</a><br />➤ Artwork: PearDrawsStuff [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/peardrawsstuff/">https://www.instagram.com/peardrawsstuff/</a> + <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYJYvw3tlI763Ih5YrIq8aA/featured?view_as=subscriber">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYJYvw3tlI763Ih5YrIq8aA/featured?view_as=subscriber</a> + <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/peardrawsstuff]">https://www.patreon.com/peardrawsstuff]</a><br />➤ Vocals <br />Anna -- that’s me! <br />I only own my voice!
