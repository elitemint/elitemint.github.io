{% raw %}This segment is is Part 3.2 of the series:<br />“Why No Stories = No Quran?”<br />How to extract Abrahamic Locution from Zikr (QurꜤānic Stories &amp; Parables)?<br /><br /><br />If you are interested in learning how to do correct supplications, and how to avoid doing incorrect supplications, then this segment is for you.<br /><br /><br />In this segment, we answer the following 13 questions:<br />1. What is the primary evidence against using ‘Allahhumma’, in a nutshell?<br />2. Why did we use the Hebrew Concordance? Isn’t this an external reference over the QurꜤān?<br />3. Why do you claim that Aya 10:10 is not related to Aya 10:9?<br />4. What about the Hadeeths and Narrations that use Allahhumma?<br />5. Is it possible that all the scholars and the students of QurꜤān missed this important Warning for 1400 years?<br />6. What happens to people who have been using Allahhumma for 1400 years?<br />7. Can you prove that our beloved SAWS did not use Allahhumma?<br />8. What about As-Salātul-Ibrāhīmiyyah?<br />9. But you say “Salla Allahu Ɛalayhi Wa Sallam”!!<br />10. What about Sayyidul Istighfār?<br />11. How to Avoid Allahhumma in DuƐāꜤ?<br />12. What other DuƐāꜤ can we use?<br />13. Why are you “sensationalizing” this issue? Or “doing “shock Value”? Or creating confusion?<br /><br /><br />To access the segment of the Selected Supplications, visit this link:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/I9mTIpVjZDs">https://youtu.be/I9mTIpVjZDs</a><br /><br /><br />To have a copy of the Selected Supplication, use this link:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dMACX0q5oRruspyErWEsD85C5FKLMD4b/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dMACX0q5oRruspyErWEsD85C5FKLMD4b/view?usp=sharing</a><br /><br /><br /><br />On this channel, we do NOT teach the (corrupted) Bible! We only teach the QurꜤān, using the Quranic methodology to extract knowledge from the Quran, exclusively!<br /><br /><br />We rely on the organic Quranic methodology, on the Abrahamic locution, and on the nested interpretation techniques to uncover the meanings and indications of the Quran verses.<br /><br />The conclusion: When the Quran Tafseer scholars decided to bring their stories form corrupted versions of the earlier scriptures, they misled the Muslims from engaging the Quran in the way that Allahh had instructed us to do.<br /><br />Why are we presenting these topics on this channel? <br />1. Our primary mission on this channel is to teach this divine 3ilm (of the organic Quranic methodology + the Abrahamic locution) after it has been undocumented for 14 centuries<br />2. Please resist the urge of learning JUST for the sake of curiosity<br />3. The ultimate goal of learning this 3ilm is to teach you Shukoor (practicing proper communication with Allahh)<br />4. This channel is NOT to AFFIRM what you were taught, but to apply the methodology to seek the truth about the Quran.
