{% raw %}Robin Williams HBO Special: Off the Wall (1978). &quot;You're only given a little spark of madness, and if you lose that... you're nothing.&quot;<br /><br />While Robin Williams started performing stand-up comedy in the mid-’70s, most of America first fell in love with him as the naïve and hilarious alien from the planet Ork in Mork &amp; Mindy. He became an instant superstar and went on to do five HBO stand-up specials and dozens of feature films. Robin performed steadily for nearly four decades—from comedy clubs to stadiums, from talk shows to USO tours—and continually amazed audiences with his frenetic energy and unbelievably quick wit. <br /><br />To see Robin's full performances, check out Time Life's Robin Williams: Comic Genius DVD Collection. All of his most memorable stand-up and television performances are together in one collection, including all five HBO Specials and never-before-released footage.
