{% raw %}Vacationers in Egypt were not expecting such gifts for the New Year.<br />Nature decided to play a joke on them.<br />On Saturday, January 1, severe hail fell in the city of Hurghada, located in eastern Egypt.<br />The hail fell in a thick veil literally in the morning, covering the beaches, streets, and hotel areas with ice. <br />The thickness of such a cover in some places reaches several centimeters.<br />Palms found themselves in a snowy landscape, unusual for these places.<br />Tourists who arrived in Hurghada, soak up the sun and go diving in the New Year, were forced to lock themselves in hotel rooms.<br />Videos from the resort are being published on social media.<br />Users claim to have seen hailstones the size of a quail's egg.<br />Streams of water flow through the streets of Hurghada, and cars have to make tracks, as if this is not happening in Africa, but somewhere in central Russia.<br />The hail is such that it knocks you off your feet, and the door to the room cannot be closed.<br />Nobody dares to approach the pool in the hotel. <br />This is more like a New Year's bombing.<br />The hail ended as suddenly as it began.<br />In Hurghada, the damage caused by the elements is being assessed.<br />And they wonder what to expect from 2022, which sends such signs in the first hours.{% endraw %}
