{% raw %}Welcome to another episode of Scrap Mechanic Multiplayer Monday! Today we are doing a race where our cars must be built entirely out of harvested tree materials.

Everything else, including wheels and steering mechanisms must be 100% tree-based!<br /><br />My Most Popular Videos (for whatever reason): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjtiR7dM6Lgrq8bJywkgM8QFsSgeQaWEI">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjtiR7dM6Lgrq8bJywkgM8QFsSgeQaWEI</a><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Collaborators<br /> @kAN Gaming  <br /> @Moonbo   <br /> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Like my Channel?
