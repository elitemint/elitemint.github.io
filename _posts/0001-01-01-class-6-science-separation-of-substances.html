{% raw %}Class 6 | Science | Separation of Substances | Methods of Separation<br /><br />In this module, you will learn about the methods of separation of substances under wet conditions.<br />Sedimentation and Decantation <br />Even liquids that do not mix with each other can be separated by the processes of sedimentation and decantation.<br />For example, water and oil.<br />Water is heavier than oil, so it settles at the bottom if you leave it alone for some time.<br />Once the water settles at the bottom, the oil can be seen floating on top.<br />Then, the oil can simply be poured out of the beaker.<br /><br />Filtration <br />Now, letâ€™s see how dirty water can be cleaned.<br />Dirty water can be completely cleaned using a filter paper.<br />This process of using a filter to separate substances is called filtration.<br />This will work as long as the holes or pores of the filter are small enough to keep the larger substances and let the smaller substances pass through.<br /><br />To watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free<br /><br />visit - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2KbImVd">http://bit.ly/2KbImVd</a>{% endraw %}
