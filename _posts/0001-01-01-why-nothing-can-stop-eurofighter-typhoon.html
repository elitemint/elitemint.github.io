{% raw %}Eurofighter Typhoon is the world’s leading air defence and ground attack aircraft with full multi and swing-role capabilities. <br /><br />The aircraft's development effectively began in 1983 with the Future European Fighter Aircraft programme, a multinational collaboration among the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain. <br /><br />The next part, we are going to show you its weapons. The Eurofighter Typhoon has 13 hardpoints for weapon carriage, four under each wing and five under the fuselage. An armament control system manages weapons selection and firing and monitors weapon status.<br />Depending on role, the fighter can carry the following mix of missiles:<br />•Air-superiority: six BVRAAM or AMRAAM air-to-air missiles on semi-recessed fuselage stations and two ASRAAM short-range air-to-air missiles on the outer pylons.<br />•Air interdiction: four AMRAAM, two ASRAAM, two cruise missiles and two anti-radar missiles.<br />•SEAD (suppression of enemy air defenses) with four AMRAAM, two ASRAAM, and six anti-radar missiles.<br />•Multirole: three AMRAAM, two ASRAAM, two ARM and two GBU-24 Paveway III/IV<br />•Close air support: with four AMRAAM, two ASRAAM,  and 18 Brimstone anti-armor missiles<br />•The last one, Maritime attack with four AMRAAM, two ASRAAM, and six anti-ship missiles.<br /><br />And the last part that we want to show you is about the engine.<br />The Eurofighter is equipped with two Eurojet EJ200 engines that have been developed by Eurojet, in Munich, each delivering thrust of 90kN in full reheat and 60kN in dry power mode. Single-stage turbines drive the three-stage fan and five-stage HP compressor. This allows Eurofighter Typhoon to cruise at supersonic speeds without the use of reheat for extended periods. The engines deliver 1,000 flying hours without needing unscheduled maintenance through the use of advanced integrated Health Monitoring for class-leading reliability, maintainability and Through Life Cost. <br /><br />The Typhoon is capable of supersonic cruise without using afterburners (referred to as supercruise). Air Forces Monthly gives a maximum supercruise speed of Mach 1.1 for the RAF FGR4 multirole version, however in a Singaporean evaluation, a Typhoon managed to supercruise at Mach 1.21 on a hot day with a combat load. But Eurofighter states that the Typhoon can supercruise at Mach 1.5.<br /><br />All content on Military TV is presented for educational purposes.<br /><br />Subscribe Now : <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0IlEuu4TA9wq1u60tLMqBw?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0IlEuu4TA9wq1u60tLMqBw?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MilitaryTV.Channel">https://www.facebook.com/MilitaryTV.Channel</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://defense-tv.com/">http://defense-tv.com/</a>{% endraw %}
