{% raw %}As the Electrify America network hits 700 sites activated and with the year drawing to a close, we take a look at the current status of DC fast charging in the USA and what challenges remain in 2021.<br /><br />Looking forward, we also examine the plans of individual charging networks and what the major players expect to do in 2022. Should national travel routes or metro areas take priority? Can the charging experience be made easier via roaming agreements/interoperability? And will exclusive networks finally begin to open up to all EV drivers? <br /><br />From Electrify America and EVgo to Rivian and Tesla, state-level investment to the National Electric Highway Coalition, we cover a lot in a little over 20 minutes, so use the chapters below if a certain piece is of interest!<br /><br />CHAPTERS<br />0:00 - Intro <br />0:35 - Location<br />1:20 - Electrify America Hits 700<br />4:29 - EVgo Plans/Progress<br />9:23 - National Electric Highway Coalition<br />11:06 - Tesla/Rivian: The End of Exclusivity?<br />14:58 - State-Level DC Fast Charging<br />17:38 - Challenges Facing US DCFC<br />19:48 - DC Fast Charging in Your Area<br />21:00 - Ko-Fi: Thanks, Bob &amp; Dave!<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br />Questions/comments/suggestions welcome via plugandplayEV@gmail.com or over on Instagram/Twitter @plugandplayEV.<br /><br />Fuel the channel by shouting us a cup of coffee via Ko-Fi (we'll write your name on the cup, honest): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/plugandplayev">https://ko-fi.com/plugandplayev</a> <br />*** Big thanks to Bob and Dave for getting the java flowing last month! ***<br />--------------------------------------<br />Music from Uppbeat:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://uppbeat.io/t/prigida/pink-clouds">https://uppbeat.io/t/prigida/pink-clouds</a><br />License code: 5SXOVMM8KKNZWLZL<br /><br />Thanks to Reece at RMTransit for the footage of Electrify Canada -- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RMTransit">https://www.youtube.com/c/RMTransit</a>{% endraw %}
