{% raw %}Personalised Videos are the future of Business to Customer communication.<br /><br />Imagine being able to send a personal video to all your clients, whether there are 1000 or 100 000 000 of them, and in each video to be able to greet them by their name and include specific information that is only relevant to that one specific viewer, whether you want to recommend a new product that they may be interested in based on their purchase history, whether you want to invite them to make an appointment with you or whether you simply want to thank them for their loyaltyâ€¦ there is just so much you can do, your imagination is the limit.{% endraw %}
