{% raw %}This video explain about an business idea based on analysis of business opportunities in tackling any issue related with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) using the NABC technique which stand for Need , Attention, Benefit and Competition. <br /><br />Need: As a result of the pandemic, more people are opting to shop online rather than in stores. Despite the fact that there are a variety of online shopping apps for purchasing items over the internet, they do not deliver the same amount of satisfaction or experience as physically shopping in a store.<br /><br /> Approach: People can purchase online using a digital platform like V.Beyond (virtual shopping app).<br /><br />Benefits: This app benefits users in a variety of ways, such as consumers engaging in online purchase and receiving a digital replica of a real-world brick-and-mortar business. <br /><br />Competition: Despite the fact that there are numerous online shopping apps, neither of them have developed virtual shopping features. <br /><br />Name: DIVYASRI R.KRISHNAN<br />Matric's Number : A19SC0484<br />Lecturer's Name : Dr Umar Haiyat Abdul Kohar{% endraw %}
