{% raw %}These heaters have worked out great for me over the years.  It may not be the best choice for everyone though.  In this video I unbox and install a 5kw Chinese diesel heater in my 10 foot box van.  I show the basics of the install and what to expect when looking for and purchasing a Chinese diesel heater for your camper van or motorhome.  <br />*My name is Brian.  I started living full time in a self built camper van in 2014 in my hometown of San Diego, CA.  I hit the road full-time in 2015 to pursue seasonal work and travel around the U.S.  I find free camping on public land and enjoy photography, hiking, biking, and kayaking in nature.  Join me on my adventures. <br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br />***Follow Your Dreams**{% endraw %}
