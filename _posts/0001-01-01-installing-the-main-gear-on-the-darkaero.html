{% raw %}If you want to learn more about the DarkAero 1 aircraft or take a course on Aerospace Composites, check out our website: www.darkaero.com<br /><br />In this video we continue where we left off in the last DarkAero 1 progress video which was getting the landing gear mounting structure secured to the fuselage. This work involved a number of small and big tasks from machining out additional carbon fiber, honeycomb bulkheads to bonding in the aft skin. With this work wrapped up we'll be heading into getting the fuselage flipped over and standing under its own weight!
