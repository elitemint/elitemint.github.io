I'm Jennifer, a forty-something wife and mother of 7 children ages 7 - 23.  We are Catholic.  We homeschool.  We cook from scratch.  We farm cranberries.  We drink coffee.  We advocate for Down syndrome awareness.  We are loud.  We are chaotic.<br /><br />Here I'll share vlogs about all these things, what I'm doing that works and what I've tried but didn't work.  I hope to encourage you in your journey through motherhood, homeschooling, learning to cook, and growing in your faith through it all.<br /><br />Business Inquiries OR Collaborations  cranmomof7@gmail.com<br /><br />For written blogs you can find me at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://camphomeschool.blogspot.com/">https://camphomeschool.blogspot.com/</a><br /><br />Instagram  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/acountry_life/">https://www.instagram.com/acountry_life/</a><br /><br />Facebook  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/camphomeschool/">https://www.facebook.com/camphomeschool/</a><br /><br />This post contains affiliate links.
