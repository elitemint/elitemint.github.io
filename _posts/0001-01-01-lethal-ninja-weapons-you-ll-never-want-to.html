{% raw %}Ninjas need a lot of skills to use their weapons and they start practicing at a young age. Here we take a look at the most lethal ninja weapons.<br /><br />Subscribe for new videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/SaufF4">http://goo.gl/SaufF4</a><br />Voiceover by Rodney Tompkins: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BigBadada2012">https://www.youtube.com/c/BigBadada2012</a><br /><br />11: Kusarigama<br />As if a sharp sickle and a heavy iron weight were both not dangerous enough as separate weapons, the Japanese decided to combine those two with a metal chain, giving birth to the kusarigama. The deadly chain-sickle weapon was developed during the Muromachi era, and has its own unique art of handling known as kusarigama-jutsu<br />10: The Kakute Ring<br />Kakute are small metal rings with spikes protruding from it, worn as a finger ring. These weapons are very much favored by the kunoichi, or female ninjas. The reason is that kakute rings are simple to use, and are concealable as they look like any other normal ring, but with spikes hidden inside the hand. The weapon is obviously only used up close, but still, is very capable of delivering<br />9: Tekko-kagi<br />Imagine brass knuckles, but with forward facing iron nails like bear claws. That's the tekko-kagi, a ninja weapon that has a close resemblance to the X-man Wolverine's protruding adamantium claws. The origin of the weapon was a rather peaceful one, as a tool for farmers to reap weeds. But in the hands of a skilled ninja<br />8: Neko Te<br />If you think the tekko-kagi was scary enough, then you should take a look at the neko-te. It is also a claw like weapon, but worn like a glove, and with the blades protruding directly from the ends of the fingers much like a cat's claws. And that's exactly what the neko-te<br />7: Metsubushi<br />Metsubushis are the pepper sprays of the ninja world. The name translates to &quot;crush the eyes&quot;, and is one thing a ninja's opponent should avoid at all costs when in a fight. The weapon could come in many forms, but are typically delivered from a small pipe that can be blown at an enemy, or from an egg shell that can be thrown<br />6: Ninjato<br />Many people know of the katana, the traditional Japanese sword used by samurai during ancient and feudal times. But ninjas also have their own version of the katana, known as ninjato. Compared to the swords carried by the samurai, ninjato were smaller in size and more compact in form. The overall length is usually less than 60 cm, and is relatively thick and straight with no curves<br />5: Fukiya<br />The fukiya is a type of blowgun used in Japan. The practice still exists today in modern Japan as a national sport similar to archery. However, fukiya was known in the past as a ninja's weapon, with numerous ninjutsu schools specializing in its use. Ninjas would often fire two inch long poison darts, or fukibari, from a concealed location. The dart itself is usually not enough to kill a target<br />4: Sai<br />Sai, the weapon familiar to those in the West as the weapon of choice for Raphael from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and the female assassin Elektra from Marvel. Traditionally used on the islands of Okinawa, the sai is useful as both an offensive and defensive weapon. The weapon has a very distinctive look as a long pointed metal baton with two curved prongs projecting from the sides. Sai users practice a variety of fighting styles<br />3: Kunai<br />The kunai is a dagger-like-weapon which serves as one of ninja's most basic but multi-functional weapons. Historically, it is believed to have been derived from hand trowels, as farmers and masons of feudal Japan used to make weapons out of any spare tools they could get their hands on. Kunais are crafted from metal into sharp blades with balance and weight in mind, as they are used both<br />2: Poison<br />We've talked about how poison could be used to compliment some weapons, often coated on tips of blades. But its deadliness and wide variety makes it deserve a special mention on this list. As stealthy assassins, ninjas could not avoid using poison, as it enables them to kill their targets without confronting them directly. Poisons could be placed directly into the food and drinks<br />1: Shuriken<br />You definitely can't talk about ninjas without mentioning shurikens. Shuriken literally translates to &quot;sword hidden in user's hand&quot;, and are sometimes referred to as throwing stars in the West. They are crafted into many different shapes and sizes, usually with a hole at the center. Shurikens might be small, but are essential tools in a ninja's arsenal. They often serve a secondary role, as a nuisance or distraction when facing an enemy. A skilled user would target{% endraw %}
