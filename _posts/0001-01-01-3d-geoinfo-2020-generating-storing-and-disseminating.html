{% raw %}Abstract. As in many countries, in The Netherlands governmental organisations are acquiring 3D city models to support their public tasks. However, this is still being done within individual organisation, resulting in differences in 3D city models within one country and sometimes covering the same area: i.e. differences in data structure, height references used, update cycle, data quality, use of the 3D data etc. In addition, often only large governmental organisations can afford investing in 3D city models (and the required knowledge) and not small organisations, like small municipalities. To address this problem, the Dutch Kadaster is collaborating with the 3D Geoinformation research group at TU Delft to generate and disseminate a 3D city model covering the whole of the Netherlands and to do this in a sustainable manner, i.e. with an implementation that ensures periodical updates and that aligns with the 3D city models of other governmental organisations, such as large cities. This article describes the workflow that has been developed and implemented.<br /><br /><br />You can red the paper here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XLIV-4-W1-2020/27/2020/">https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XLIV-4-W1-2020/27/2020/</a>{% endraw %}
