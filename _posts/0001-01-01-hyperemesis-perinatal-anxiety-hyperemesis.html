{% raw %}Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG) is at the extreme end of the pregnancy sickness spectrum. It affects 1-2% of pregnant women every year (around 3 Million globally). <br /><br />Without medical intervention women with HG will suffer tremendously. Whilst the physical aspects of this condition are often overlooked and &quot;brushed off&quot; as morning sickness and women are often misdiagnosed, the mental affects of this disease are just as forgotten. <br /><br />This film will look in to one of them.....Perinatal Anxiety. <br /><br />Presented by Brushed Off Films Producer and HG Campaigner Charlotte Howden. Charlotte suffered with HG in 2015 with her son Henry.{% endraw %}
