The people who are passionate about American values, aren’t afraid to engage big ideas, and who care about where the country is headed. The people who are conservative in their views but aren’t beholden to any party’s talking points. The independent thinkers who rely on things like the facts, context, and perspective to inform their ideology. The people who, although they form the backbone of this country, have been cast aside by the politicians and the media.<br /><br />The people whose beliefs and values are increasingly being cancelled. They are why we created The First. You are why we created The First.<br /> <br />We’re the home of free speech, free ideas, and free TV.<br /> <br />Learn even more at www.thefirsttv.com.{% endraw %}
