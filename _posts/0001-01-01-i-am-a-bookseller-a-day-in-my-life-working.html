{% raw %}I‚Äôve recently decided to work a bit at my local bookshop in order to diversify my work and bring some balance back to my life. Recently, I‚Äôve spent much of my time working from home, especially since lockdown last year, and it was time for a change. While I only work a little there each week, I hope to do so more in the future! None of this video is, or ever will be, sponsored content. Relevant links that help me out are linked below. Thank you for all your kindness and support of my videos. <br /><br />üìöLibro.fm is an audiobook service that supports independent bookstores around the USA. It offers the same rates as audible while supporting your local communities. One benefit over audible I find is that even if you are unable to afford a payment one month, you still have access to all your previously purchased books. If you want to check them out here is a referral link for your first month: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://libro.fm/referral?rf_code=lfm94789">https://libro.fm/referral?rf_code=lfm94789</a> (if you want you can choose to support my local bookshop Trail‚Äôs End Bookstore, or your local independent seller!)<br />The website to my local bookshop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.trailsendbookstore.com">https://www.trailsendbookstore.com</a><br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏èNo obligation whatsoever, but if you would like to donate to support this channel. $5 will get a thank you postcard (my own art) from me in the mail (you must include address in your note so I can send it!). It is much appreciated: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=HHM6PC6SV23UN">https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=HHM6PC6SV23UN</a><br />(Now and then a postcard has been returned to me or lost in the mail. If you have not received a postcard e-mail me at endymionmerrill@gmail.com! I send them out once a month, so definitely don‚Äôt be too worried if it has been a couple weeks but do contact me if you have any concerns. ) <br />Thank you!<br /><br />ü¶ãInstagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/the_cottage_fairy/">https://www.instagram.com/the_cottage_fairy/</a><br /><br />ü•ó üçé One way I started prioritizing cooking healthy meals was using HelloFresh as a supplement to my diet along with trips to my grocery store.
