Add the pork and sear for 5 minutes on both sides to get some color on the pork.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Add the cider, stock, soy sauce, sage, rosemary, garlic powder, allspice, onion and apple and stir to combine.  Cover and braise over low heat for 1.5-2 hours.  You can do this in a 325 degree oven or in a slow cooker over high heat for four hours as well.<br /><br />Remove the pork and raise heat to high.  Reduce liquid by half and squeeze in the juice of half an orange.  Stir, taste for seasoning and return the pork to the orange-cider glaze to coat.  <br /><br />For the Sweet Potatoes<br />2 Large or 3 Medium sweet potatoes, peeled and diced<br />1 cup heavy cream<br />Pinch of ground cinnamon<br />1 T maple syrup (can use brown sugar or honey)<br />2 T unsalted butter<br />Salt and Pepper to taste<br /><br />Place the cut sweet potatoes in a large pot of salted water and bring to a boil.  Boil until potatoes are fork tender (about 15-20 minutes depending on size).  Drain and return to the hot pot.  Add the butter, maple syrup, cinnamon and about half the heavy cream.  Use a hand mixer (or potato masher) to whip the sweet potatoes to your desired consistency, adding more cream if necessary.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve immediately.{% endraw %}
