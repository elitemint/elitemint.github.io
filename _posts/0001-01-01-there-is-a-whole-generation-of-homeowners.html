{% raw %}InvestSMART Chief Market Strategist Evan Lucas says there is a whole generation of homeowners who have never experienced a rate rise. <br /><br />&quot;The last time we actually saw the RBA increase rates was back in 2011 - and we're now in 2021, we're going into 2022 and it's argued that we may not even see one next year,&quot; Mr Lucas told Sky News Australia. <br /><br />&quot;So, it could be 11 years since we've seen a movement up in rates. <br /><br />&quot;We've seen a lot go down, but we haven't seen a movement up - so we haven't experienced that.&quot;{% endraw %}
