{% raw %}Longing is passion huge, immense passion and yet it is but abstraction,<br />I understand it is an illustration of deep togetherness, mutual penetration.<br /><br />Wherever u play a role, whatever role, u are human being in entirety,<br />U come through otherâ€™s profound togetherness, through full fertility,<br />The juncture u cross over or come across where u drown in emotion.<br /><br />U have but to swim in the sea of reality touching its waves and storms.<br />U are capable though to float above, storms evolve in u like sweet thorns.<br />U conglomerate all those, breed new meanings &amp; haunt for translation.<br />*** ***<br />10.3.20<br />Prof. Dr,Mokhdum Mushafi{% endraw %}
