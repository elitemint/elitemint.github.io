{% raw %}In many places, menstruation is still taboo, and attitudes towards it have a social and political impact on gender equality. Pandora's Box is produced and directed by a primarily female crew. It takes us on a global journey, including India, Kenya, the UK and North America, to explore the subjugation of people who menstruate.<br /><br />Pandora's Box shares the stories of girls who miss school because they can't access the menstrual supplies they need, from Maasai villages to the city of London - revealing that period poverty is a truly global issue affecting millions every day. Pandora's Box elevates the voices of those who are often ignored or forgotten, from formerly incarcerated women to those living in poverty.<br /><br />Pandora's Box follows heroes, innovators, activists and thought leaders as they tackle the stigma and silence around menstruation. The film reveals a growing global movement to end period poverty, and the urgent need for us all to play a part. <br /><br />#freedocumentary #documentary #equality<br />______<br /><br />DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
