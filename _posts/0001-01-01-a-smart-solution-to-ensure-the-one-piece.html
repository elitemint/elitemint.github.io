{% raw %}The innovative Low Cost Automation by Lean Lab Solutions (NV partner) works to properly run the one-piece-flow between the workstations. The next unit can be moved ahead only after the previous unit is picked-up by the next workstation. No double-handling by both the operators who just make the minimum movement to put/ pick the unit.{% endraw %}
