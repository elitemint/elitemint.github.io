{% raw %}At 8:46am on September 11th, 2001 - the world changed forever.<br /><br />A hijacked airliner was flown deliberately into the north tower of the World Trade Center followed seventeen minutes later by another plane which hit the south tower. A third airliner was flown into the Pentagon from where the US directed its global military operations while a fourth was brought down by courageous passengers who wrestled for control of the aircraft with the hijackers.<br /><br />For decades, the US had believed that it existed behind an armoured shield comprised of its enormous military might. That belief was now shattered. With so many people killed not just from the United States but from across the globe, it was truly an attack on the free world and the cry went out for justice. For revenge.<br /><br />Very quickly, it was concluded that the attack was authorized by Osama Bin Laden, the head of the al-Qaeda terrorist network who had long dreamed of a spectacular attack on the US mainland. Known to be hiding out in Afghanistan under the umbrella of the ideologically driven Taliban regime, the US and its Allies geared up for war. On September 10th, only a small proportion of Americans knew where Afghanistan was on a map. On September 12th, nearly the entire population were focused on this rural, landlocked country as the hunt for the most wanted man on Earth began.<br /><br />In this, the second episode of a two-part special on the violent history of Afghanistan, we are going to examine the American-led invasion of Afghanistan; Americaâ€™s longest war.<br /><br /><br />Prefer to listen on the go?
