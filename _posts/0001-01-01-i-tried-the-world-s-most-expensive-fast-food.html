But Shake Shack may have found a way around this. They recently released a *pricey* limited-time black truffle burger, and it costs a whopping $8.79. That's expensive for a burger. I mean, really expensive. But, naturally, I tested the burger out, brought it home and examined it, and attempted to make a better version. I ultimately put about $500 worth of black truffle shavings on it, and it was delicious. My favorite part was the homemade potato buns, which I've listed out the ingredients for as follows: <br /><br />Potato Buns <br />½ lb russet potatoes (1 inch cubes) <br />2 tbsp unsalted butter<br />2 ¼ cups (12 ⅓ oz) bread flour (plus extra if needed) <br />1 tbsp granulated sugar<br />2 tsp instant yeast<br />1 tsp table salt<br />2 large eggs<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------<br />IN THE MOOD FOR MORE FOOD?
