{% raw %}The roadmap to ending pollution from transportation is here, says electrification advocate Monica Araya. In conversation with head of TED Chris Anderson, Araya introduces Drive Electric: a global campaign to retire the polluting internal combustion engine in time to avoid climate disaster. And she shares some exciting news: a breakthrough funding commitment from the Audacious Project that puts the project well on its way to realizing a billion-dollar plan to supercharge the transition to electric vehicles over the next five years. Learn more about the coalition of 70 organizations powering this global action -- and the role all cities, politicians and citizens can play to secure a zero-emission transport future. (This ambitious plan is a part of the Audacious Project, TED's initiative to inspire and fund global change.)<br /><br />Countdown is TED's global initiative to accelerate solutions to the climate crisis. The goal: to build a better future by cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, in the race to a zero-carbon world.
