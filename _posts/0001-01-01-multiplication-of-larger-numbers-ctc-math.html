{% raw %}CTC Math<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ctcmath.com/">http://ctcmath.com/</a> <br /><br />Join with more than 217,000 students now confident in math because finally they can do it!<br /> <br />Learn at your pace, not somebody else's<br />Stop and rewind the teacher until you get it<br />Builds confidence<br />24 x 7 unlimited access when you want it<br />Catch up or you can even get ahead<br />Start getting much better grades<br /><br />View the Tutorial<br /><br />Each of the 1,400+ CTC Math tutorials last around 4-9 minutes and presents the concepts of the math lesson step-by-step. Using synchronised audio and animation which harnesses both audio and visual learning styles simultaneously. CTC math lessons can be studied at home or at school and even on some modern mobile phones. Obviously no one can force a young person to study math, but what we have done here is to provide materials that are interesting and stimulating in themselves, and which will encourage the student, once started, to continue studying.<br />Completing the Interactive Questions or Worksheet<br />Following each math tutorial there are interactive questions or an optional printable worksheet which tests the understanding of key concepts. Answers are entered into CTC Math automated marking system which then stores the results in each individual student's ongoing progress report. This brings in the third learning style - Kinaesthetic, which is the process of actually doing the math yourself.<br />One Page Summaries<br />A printable one page summary of each tutorial provides the student with concise and complete notes from the math tutorial. Ideal as a reminder for homework, revision and review.<br />View Worked Solutions<br />After answers have been submitted, printable fully worked solutions become available showing every step which should be taken to reach the correct answer, just as it should be done in a math exam.<br /><br />Marking and Reports<br /><br />Ongoing progress reports are built for each individual. This helps parents and students in identifying weaker areas requiring further study. Every math lesson a student attempts is logged and the results stored along with statistical information detailing when they passed, what they scored and how much time and effort they put in to pass that lesson. Parents can instantly see the areas where their children may need additional help.{% endraw %}
