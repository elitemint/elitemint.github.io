{% raw %}Since WEALTHTRACK’s inception, it’s been an annual tradition to sit down for a rare in-depth interview with Ed Hyman, Wall Street’s number one-ranked economist for an unrivaled forty-one years.  <br />Hyman is a Wall Street legend known for his comprehensive, yet succinct daily bullet point reports on the economy covering multiple data points including his team’s proprietary company surveys covering a wide range of businesses.  <br />Last year at this time the U.S. was emerging from lockdowns, vaccines hadn’t been distributed, Covid was resurfacing, fatalities were up but the economy and markets were rebounding sharply.<br />That was not a surprise to Hyman because of the massive amount of monetary and fiscal stimulus pouring into the economy.  As a matter of fact, it was the major reason   Hyman predicted on WEALTHTRACK a year ago that 2021 would be a “blowout” year in terms of both economic and corporate earnings growth.  <br />How would he describe it in retrospect and what are his economic and market expectations for 2022? Hyman answers those questions and more.<br /><br />00:00 Hello <br />00:37 Introduction <br />01:55 Interview with Ed Hyman<br />18:27 One Investment<br />20:09 Action Point<br /><br />WEALTHTRACK Episode 1824 published on December 13, 2021<br /><br /><br /> #gdp #economic growth #gross domestic product #stock market #AAPL #AMZN #LEN #PFE{% endraw %}
