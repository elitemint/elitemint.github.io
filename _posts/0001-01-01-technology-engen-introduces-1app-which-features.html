{% raw %}Engen's innovative 1App now features a 'Tip an Attendant' function, which allows motorists and shoppers across South Africa to tip deserving Engen staff for the warm and friendly service that they have long been renowned for.  In partnership with Telkom Financial Services, this new value add feature has been specifically designed to enable motorists and Quickshop customers to tip Engen petrol attendants and cashiers for efficient service.
