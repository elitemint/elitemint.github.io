{% raw %}Do you need ideas for holiday decor this year? What about a quick and easy gift to give friends and family? Maybe just looking for some holiday cheer? Then this project is the perfect one for you!<br /><br />This garland of fabric Holiday lights does a magical job of lighting up a room, and they don’t even require electricity. Hang them above a doorway, string them on your Christmas tree, or drape them in your windows for a reusable piece of decor that doesn’t consist of faulty bulbs. You can make as many lights as you please, or maybe just one to use as an ornament, and at approximately 4 1/2 “ long they aren’t too big, aren’t too small, but just the right size. <br /><br />In this video, I chose Maureen Cracknell’s collection, “Cozy and Magical,” in addition to the Pure Solid “Raw Gold,“ if you want to recreate this exact version. <br /><br />If you have any questions or tips, please share them in the comments below!<br /><br />As always, don't forget to give this video a thumbs up and make sure to subscribe to the Art Gallery Fabrics channel for more tutorials like this one.  <br /><br />Happy Sewing!<br /><br />Things you’ll need:<br />-AGF Cozy and Magical<br />-AGF Pure Solid<br />-Stuffing<br />-Twine<br />-Sewing Machine<br />-Poking tool<br />-Fabric Pen<br />-Iron<br />-Scissors<br />-Pins<br />-Fabric clips<br />-Lightbulb template you can find here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://artgalleryfabrics.typepad.com/Light%20Garland%20Template_revised.pdf">https://artgalleryfabrics.typepad.com/Light%20Garland%20Template_revised.pdf</a> <br /><br /><br />To view more, check out our “AGF Fabric Collections” playlist: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLR...">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLR...</a><br /><br />// BUY THE FABRICS<br />▸ consumer |  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://liveartgalleryfabrics.com/where-to-buy/store-locator/">https://liveartgalleryfabrics.com/where-to-buy/store-locator/</a><br />▸ wholesale | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://artgalleryfabrics.com/welcome.shtml">https://artgalleryfabrics.com/welcome.shtml</a><br /><br /><br />// DISCOVER MORE<br />▸ check our blog | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://agfblog.com​​">http://agfblog.com​​</a><br />▸ sign up for our newsletters (+ get a chance to win free fabrics!) | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://eepurl.com/bJ6aH1">http://eepurl.com/bJ6aH1</a><br /><br /><br />// FOLLOW<br />▸Facebook | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ArtGalleryFabrics/">https://www.facebook.com/ArtGalleryFabrics/</a><br />▸Twitter | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ArtGalleryFab">https://twitter.com/ArtGalleryFab</a><br />▸Instagram | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/artgalleryfabrics/">https://www.instagram.com/artgalleryfabrics/</a><br />▸Pinterest | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/artgalleryfabrics/">https://www.pinterest.com/artgalleryfabrics/</a><br />▸TikTok | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@artgalleryfabrics">https://www.tiktok.com/@artgalleryfabrics</a><br /><br />#artgalleryfabrics #holidaylightgarland #sewingtutorial{% endraw %}
