{% raw %}The Gospel | Pt. 2 - Discovering the Gospel - In this video the immortal Gospel of Jesus Christ (that is, the Christian message of how to be saved) is explained in exhaustive detail. In section 1, various tactics are discussed for how to most effectively communicate the Gospel to listeners. The perfection of God is specifically stressed as a way of bringing conviction to the lost. In section 2, two dilemmas are discussed: (1) How can God remain just when He forgives sins and (2) how can anyone be saved if God requires the perfect fulfilment of His Law of them all? Ultimately, the answer to both dilemmas is Jesus Christ. Section 3 is a thorough exposition of the holy Scriptures, where Biblical proof is offered for much of the claims that proceeded in the former sections. The main subjects taught about in this section are The Great Exchange, Imputed Righteousness and Bible verses that show that it is the righteousness of Christ specifically that is imputed to the believer. And finally, section 4 goes about defining what saving faith actually looks like according to the Bible. It is shown from Scripture that faith is an abiding trust in Christ alone and His perfect work on our behalf and nothing (no works) can be added to this equation. Other common methods of salvation are also addressed, such as &quot;accept Jesus as your personal Savior&quot; or saying the Sinners Prayer, and are ultimately shown to be different than the Biblical method of having faith alone in Christ alone for salvation. I pray the video will be a blessing to whoever watches it.<br /><br />SECTION LINKS &amp; TIMES<br />0:00 - Introduction<br />5:34 - Section 1: Gospel Tools<br />26:27 - Section 2: The Divine Dilemma<br />1:13:51 - Section 3: The Gospel of God's Word<br />1:41:48 - Section 4: Defining Faith<br />1:56:33 - Closing<br /><br />Support the creation of videos like this by becoming a Patron of my channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/TheophilusMostExcellent">https://www.patreon.com/TheophilusMostExcellent</a><br /><br />Also be sure to check out my secondary channel (Christian Video Vault) where I post content more frequently:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtBvO5YdROe5CWU41KVde4Q/videos">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtBvO5YdROe5CWU41KVde4Q/videos</a><br /><br />| Recommendations in order of mention |<br /><br />My first Gospel video:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uz5GQRpnRo&amp;t=19s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uz5GQRpnRo&amp;t=19s</a><br /><br />My playlist on proving Jesus is God:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyVmGGynU80&amp;list=PL0ZaautnfUXNqSSbt9EVp8amjR8xVP6v4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyVmGGynU80&amp;list=PL0ZaautnfUXNqSSbt9EVp8amjR8xVP6v4</a><br /><br />My video where I teach more about the Branch prophecy:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_TsQqqpHfo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_TsQqqpHfo</a><br /><br />| Credits |<br /><br />Opening song:<br />Hero's Theme by Twin Musicom is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</a> <br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twinmusicom.org/song/280/heros-theme">http://www.twinmusicom.org/song/280/heros-theme</a> <br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twinmusicom.org">http://www.twinmusicom.org</a><br /><br />Final song - Be Thou My Vision by Joseph Habedank: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIRAfaak_jM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIRAfaak_jM</a><br /><br />Full of Eyes art pieces featured throughout the video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fullofeyes.com/">https://www.fullofeyes.com/</a> &amp; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/fullofeyes/?ref=br_rs">https://www.facebook.com/fullofeyes/?ref=br_rs</a><br /><br />As a side note, I encourage my Christian brothers who are interested to examine my Playlists section here on YouTube:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClh6ABQPVkU3N1fD7jb_6yA/playlists">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClh6ABQPVkU3N1fD7jb_6yA/playlists</a><br /><br />I have put together a lot of good material for the believing Christian, esp. the newborn Christian, categorizing it all the best I could. There is quite a lot of good material available, ranging from apologetics, which is reasons for faith and answers to difficulties regarding faith, to Biblical teaching, to in-depth examinations of various other worldviews, as well as videos exposing satanic teachings/teachers, occultism, New World Order/Illuminati type things and many many others.<br /><br />I hope the video edifies and builds up the Church of Christ.

I love all of you very much and I hope you're blessed in the Lord.<br /><br />Godspeed,<br />Theophilus{% endraw %}
