{% raw %}#firsttimereaction #franckyvincent #passionfruit #french90s<br />Hi all welcome back to another video Dereck Reacts back at it again! This time around we take a look at another first time reaction with Francky Vincent and his song &quot;Passion Fruit.&quot; Francky gets me moving side to side, giving us all of those island feels. This one is super rhythmic, but also super naughty.
