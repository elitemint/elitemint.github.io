{% raw %}When the frost and ice and salt is on the roads thats the time to lay the bike away and sometimes that can mean no riding for days, weeks and even months. In this time the fuel stored in your tank could go stay and even more so if it contains ethanol.<br />Ethanol is a plant derived alcohol that contains water. Over time the water can separate and bacteria will then be able to grow in your fuel tank.<br />This bacteria turns the fuel acidic which in turn rots and damaged sensitive components like carburettors, fuel injectors &amp; pumps, filters, and also ruins certain rubber hoses and plastic fuel tanks.<br />Metal fuel tanks can rust internally also. Ethanol is a real problem especially for older vehicles that are designed to run on &quot;proper&quot; petrol.<br />Fuel diamond is supposed to address a lot of these issue's however I believe it will not stop fuel separating but it will neutralise the acid forming bacteria. (I may be wrong) But for the price, I think I paid Â£12 for the diamond. <br />It's simply fit and forget, lasts upto 5 years and there is nothing more to do apart from fill up and ride, or relax and rest assured you have done all you can to prevent ethanol problems.<br />One other thing I do when storing a bike for some time is I always fill my fuel tank to the brim with the best fuel I can find.<br />For super long term storage you may be better off completely draining all the fuel out of the tank and hoses etc. This can be har4der to do than it sounds.<br />Fingers crossed, Fuel diamond will work and do what they say it will:){% endraw %}
