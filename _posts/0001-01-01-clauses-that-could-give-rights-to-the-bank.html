{% raw %}There most definitely is a trust deficit. Otherwise, the only way that any type of trust can be reestablished or standardized was to be if there were laws or things in place.<br />So even if there was some sort of government program which says it's not possible for any bank to take over your property or sell it because of your debt issues. The main one has around missed payments or defaults, but primarily around arrears. That's the main one and the other one is circumstances where somebody bought a property as a buy to let and they've been decided to live in it. That also becomes an issue because technically the borrower has actually broken the terms of the loan and they're now living in the property, which means that they've got different rights when it comes to any debt recovery issues for the bank, because technically, now it becomes a regulated property because they're living in it. So it increases their risk in terms of getting control of the property back in their hands. Another area that these are a bit more technical area is something called an all monies charge where the bank has charged across maybe ten of your properties. And this is one of them. And if you've got arrears on this particular one or another one, they can technically force their charges and across all ten properties to claim back any shortfall on one of the properties that they took receivership off but couldn't get their money out. <br /><br /><br />üîî Subscribe now!   <br /><br />üó£Ô∏èFOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2nUZOrO">http://bit.ly/2nUZOrO</a> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2oIJY4c">http://bit.ly/2oIJY4c</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/35KRmMZ">http://bit.ly/35KRmMZ</a> <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2MsNbxu">http://bit.ly/2MsNbxu</a> <br />Linked In: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/mc4you">https://uk.linkedin.com/in/mc4you</a> <br /><br />Visit immediate bank claims:              <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.immediatebankclaims.co.uk/">http://www.immediatebankclaims.co.uk/</a> <br />Visit immediate bank claims Blog Site:              <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.blogs.immediatebankclaims...">https://www.blogs.immediatebankclaims...</a><br /><br />#shorts #homerepossession #repossessions #unregulatedproperty  #commercialpropertyBuytoLet #Bridgingfinance #desktopvaluations  #secondchargelending <br />#Bailiffs #possession #redemption #LPA receiversFixed-charge <br />#buy to let property #unregulatedoracommercialloan #loantovalue<br />#changeofuse #regulatedmortgage #dis-instructing <br />#thepropertyfixer  #rescuemyproperties  #stopeviction #stoprepossession #immediatebankclaims #mc4u #negativeequity #negativeequityexpert #finance #n244 #btl #record #landlords #propertymarket #estateagent #ukpropertymarket #propertysales #propertyportfolio #propertydevelopments<br />#redemption #dis instruct #LPA receiver #law of property act 1925 #receivers #receivership #repossessed{% endraw %}
