{% raw %}Too much is expected of urban parks. Neighborhood parks in the United States are expensive, unsustainable, inaccessible, and empty most of the time. Keun’s talk highlights what’s missing in contemporary park development and urban planning and calls for a re-imagination of our parks and neighborhoods. Keun is an assistant professor and a co-director of the VIVID lab (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://laep.usu.edu/vivid/)">https://laep.usu.edu/vivid/)</a> in the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning at Utah State University. He holds a Ph.D. in Metropolitan Planning, Policy, and Design from the University of Utah. Keun conducts behavioral research through spatial data analytics and digital technologies. Ultimately, his study aims to understand how to create healthy, just, and resilient cities through smart growth and urban nature. Specific research agendas include 1) Technology-driven behavioral research in public space (e.g., drone), 2) Spatial research on smart growth (compact, mixed-use, walkable, and transit-supportive developments) and its behavioral outcomes, and 3) Environmental justice and accessibility in urban nature. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
