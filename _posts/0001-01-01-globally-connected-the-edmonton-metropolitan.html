{% raw %}The Edmonton Metropolitan Region is connected in every sense of the word. Free trade agreements and integrated infrastructure mean easy trade access to the rest of the world. A welcoming and inclusive environment also gives our region a vibrant global identity and mindset. The region is home to a foreign trade zone, allowing companies to ship materials and unfinished products here so they can be sold to global markets as Canadian products within existing trade agreements ― a major advantage in today’s challenging trade environment.{% endraw %}
