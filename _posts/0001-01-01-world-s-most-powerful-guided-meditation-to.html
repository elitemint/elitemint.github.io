{% raw %}Click HERE to get our 4, best-guided meditations to attract money effortlessly for free! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drattraction.com/4moneygm/">https://drattraction.com/4moneygm/</a><br />It will work with scientific accuracy! <br />P.S. Anything promoted here is free and 100% created by the owner of this YouTube Channel.<br /><br />.................................<br /><br />Be honest‚Ä¶<br /><br />When you think about money, or creating more abundance in your life, how does it make you feel?<br /><br />Does it make you feel happy and liberated?<br /><br />Or, does it make you feel stressed and upset?<br /><br />What many people don‚Äôt realize is that by thinking negative thoughts about wealth (thoughts like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have enough‚Äù or even replaying past negative experiences with money), they‚Äôre actually repelling instead of attracting abundance. <br /><br />Your initial reaction to our question about creating more money is actually what is running the show! This is your subconscious speaking. <br /><br />Our outer world is simply a reflection of our inner thoughts and feelings, which is why it‚Äôs so important to have the tools to reprogram negative thoughts and feelings. Through subconscious reprogramming, like meditation and Mind Movies, you have the opportunity to create an abundant mindset so that you can live a fulfilling and prosperous life.<br /><br />So is your body currently programmed to attract more abundance, or are you subconsciously sabotaging your financial success? <br />Do you want to step into a new mindset that will help you craft a new, abundant future?<br /><br />By listening to this 25-minute guided meditation for wealth from world renowned wealth coach, Jean-Francois Fortin, you‚Äôll learn to visualize and manifest your dreams.<br /><br />This audio will help you relax, step back and visualize the abundance already in your life, but which might not feel within your reach yet. It will guide you into a relaxed state of mind and then take you on a guided journey into your future.<br /><br />Remember ‚Äî what you visualize, you ACTUALIZE.<br /><br />.................................<br /><br />Jean-Francois recommends you listen to this every day for 30 days to really create shifts in your life. The more you use it, the better results you‚Äôll see. <br /><br />If you like what you‚Äôre hearing, get our full set of 4 AMAZING guided meditation tracks here: ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://beforebed.net">http://beforebed.net</a><br /><br />.................................<br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS:<br />#1. FOCUS IS THE NAME OF THE GAME!<br />Find a quiet place where you could relax. Lay your body in a very comfortable position (I personally like to use a lounging recliner chair) and use headphones.<br /><br />#2. ‚ÄúI AM‚Äù OR ‚ÄúI FEEL‚Äù AFFIRMATIONS<br />Each time and ‚ÄúI AM‚Äù or ‚ÄúI FEEL‚Äù affirmation is given, echo it in your mind. Do this even if it feels weird or wrong at first. With time it will feel like home!<br /><br />#3. THIS IS A VISUALIZATION EXERCISE<br />You need to see those guided meditations as VISUALIZATION EXERCISE! So with each track, try to FEEL the action through at least one of your 5 senses (hear, see, smell, touch, and taste).<br /><br />WATCH when you go to bed<br />ATTRACT more money<br />REPEAT the process<br /><br />.................................<br /><br />‚óè Voice Over made by Tim D J.; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~012b7cd4613255c419">https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~012b7cd4613255c419</a><br /><br />.................................<br />¬©Ô∏èCopyright:<br /><br />ROYALTY-FREE MUSIC by BENSOUND<br />Music used with permission from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bensound.com">https://www.bensound.com</a><br /><br />Footage licensed through Videoblocks<br />For all my videos I have all licenses/permissions from copyright holders for commercial use.<br /><br />.................................<br /><br />INTERACT WITH US ‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BeforeBedvideos/">https://www.facebook.com/BeforeBedvideos/</a><br /><br />.................................<br /><br />If you struggle to relax and combat stress and anxiety, try ‚ÄúNature Imagery Therapy‚Äù.
