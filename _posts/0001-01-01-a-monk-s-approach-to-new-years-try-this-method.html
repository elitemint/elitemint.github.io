{% raw %}A Monk's Approach to New Years | Try This Method<br /><br />In this video, I wanted to give you a different approach to looking at the New Years - how do we celebrate and prepare for this occasion in the monastery? As Buddhist monks, we try to be mindful of our thoughts, speech and actions so New Years is another occasion that we get to practice ourselves. I hope this new approach is helpful and feel free to use this strategy to improve yourself if you find it helpful. I hope you enjoy! #monks #buddhism #newyears<br /><br />Timestamp<br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />0:42 Common ways of celebration<br />2:24 Monk‚Äôs New Years Eve routine<br />4:34 Purpose of our schedule<br />7:15 Why am I sharing this?<br /><br /><br />______________________________________________________<br /><br />‚úÖ Venerable Nick‚Äôs Website:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nickkeomahavong.com/">https://www.nickkeomahavong.com/</a><br /><br />______________________________________________________<br /><br />üî∂ Join the ‚ÄúMonk Life Thailand‚Äù ordination program, to experience the life of a monk in this 30 - 60 day training at the International Forest Monastery (iMonastery) located in Chiang Mai, Thailand:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.monklife.info/">https://www.monklife.info/</a><br /><br />üî∂ Join the Pa Pae Meditation Retreat if you would like to meditate in the beautiful nature of the Chiang Mai mountains.
