{% raw %}#America #fitzfishponds #koi #wholesale #koicarp @Evolution Aqua <br /><br />This is my first visit to American since Covid started. I usually go quite often throughout the year! I have supplied Koi in America for 20 years. <br /><br />This is the first time seeing the 100 acre facility for Fitz Fish Ponds. It really is different to how we enjoy our ponds. <br /><br />I hope you enjoy the video and hopefully it will become a regular part of the channel as we have a lot of work to do in America. <br /><br />www.everythingkoi.com<br />www.fitzfishponds.com{% endraw %}
