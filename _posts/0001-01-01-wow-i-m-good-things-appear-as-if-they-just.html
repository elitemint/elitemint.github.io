{% raw %}Rabbi Mordechai Salfer, Rosh Yeshivas Doresh, discusses how many things appear as if they just sprout up on their own and lead us to believe, “Wow, I’m good!” However, HaShem really planted them years before so that they will be ready to sprout and to ‘appear’ when the time is right. HaShem prepares everything well in advance to be ready for us and when it sprouts from seemingly nowhere we think that it just ‘happened’. We must attempt to look for the Hashgacha and look for the Yad HaShem in each situation. If we look for it we have a chance to see it.{% endraw %}
