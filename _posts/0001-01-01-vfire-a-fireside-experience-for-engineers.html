{% raw %}Keysight’s Virtual Festive Internet Relaxation Experience (vFIRE) sets a new industry standard. <br />Subscribe ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/KLabs_sub">http://bit.ly/KLabs_sub</a><br />Contact us for more about our FaaS offerings (Fire as a Service)<br /><br />Featuring 5025 seconds of log burning enjoyment. vFIRE leverages cutting-edge Keysight tech including a 28.5 GHz P5004A VNA, a U5857A Thermal Camera, and a DSOX1204G X-Series Oscilloscope to finally answer the age-old question - what is the RF performance of a glass of eggnog?<br /> <br />From the warm glow of our monitors to yours, may all of your beverages have the tastiest S21 and S11 measurements.  (requires option P5004A–190). <br /><br />*Note: per the legal team’s guidance, the original project name “COAL” or &quot;Coaxially-Optimized Artificial Log&quot; has been discontinued and should no longer be used pending arbitration with THE NORTH POLE, LLC.<br /><br />If you're wondering about the VNA setup (I know that's why you're here), the yellow trace is S11, the blue trace is S21.<br /><br />The start frequency is roughly 10 kHz and the stop frequency is roughly 8 GHz. I could have gone higher but I didn't want to stick my fancy cables into boiling water.<br /><br />Each vertical division is roughly 10-15 dB.<br /><br />The oscilloscope is hooked up to those red lights and is in normal trigger mode (if you pause just right you can see the lights turning back on).<br /><br />0:00 Keysight vFIRE<br />2:00 cream soda<br />2:20 virtual fire side experience begins<br />18:20 ginger ale<br />19:00 vFIRE is v fire<br />28:55 stoked<br />30:35 stoked and stockinged<br />32:55 just stoked again<br />35:55 egg noggin<br />50:45 way too late in the day for breakfast tea<br />52:40 tape was a bad choice<br />53:15 I got 99 probelems<br />54:00 I've been advised the tape is not edible<br />54:20 tape was a REALLY bad choice<br />54:35 regretting my cable choices<br />55:55 that S21 looks pretty ok!<br />58:35 watching the S21 is a vibe<br />1:01:41 Imma let you finish but Beyonce had<br />1:02:55 udderly delicious<br />1:03:10 why did I double down on the tape!?<br />1:05:40 taaaaape<br />1:05:47 cookie<br />1:06:28 surprise cookie<br />1:12:02 hot cocoa<br />1:13:10 needs moar cocoa<br />1:17:11 turns out the scope is in &quot;normal&quot; trigger mode<br />1:19:15 cookie dough<br />1:20:18 another snowman casualty pls f in chat<br />1:21:00 I still have cookie dough in my SMA send help<br />1:23:25 om nom{% endraw %}
