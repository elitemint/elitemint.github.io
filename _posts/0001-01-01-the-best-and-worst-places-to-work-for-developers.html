{% raw %}As a junior software developer, how should you choose where to work? and how should you think about your career path? Here is some software developer career advice. There are as many routes through a career in software as there are software engineers, but if you are just starting out this can seem confusing and daunting. It's not as simple as &quot;work for Google&quot; or &quot;work for Electronic Arts&quot; - though these may be good software developer job choices for some people. So how do you choose where are good places to start?<br /><br />In this episode, experienced software developer Dave Farley, gives his take on the advantages and disadvantages of some of the different types of companies that employ software developers, and offers his advice on how to spot the best ones and how to dismiss the places you will, in future, wish you had avoided.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />üìö BOOKS:<br /><br />üìñ Dave‚Äôs NEW BOOK &quot;Modern Software Engineering&quot; is now available to pre-order with 35% off with the code MODERNSWENG ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://informit.com/modernsweng">https://informit.com/modernsweng</a><br /><br />In this book, Dave brings together his ideas and proven techniques to describe a durable, coherent and foundational approach to effective software development, for programmers, managers and technical leads, at all levels of experience.<br /><br />üìñ &quot;Continuous Delivery Pipelines&quot; by Dave Farley<br />paperback ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3gIULlA">https://amzn.to/3gIULlA</a><br />ebook version ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://leanpub.com/cd-pipelines">https://leanpub.com/cd-pipelines</a><br /><br />üìñ The original, award-winning &quot;Continuous Delivery&quot; book by Dave Farley and Jez Humble <br />‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2WxRYmx">https://amzn.to/2WxRYmx</a><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Also from Dave:<br /><br />üéì CD TRAINING COURSES  ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/DFTraining">https://bit.ly/DFTraining</a><br /><br />üìß JOIN CD MAIL LIST üìß<br />Keep up to date with the latest discussions, free &quot;How To...&quot; guides, events, online courses and exclusive offers. ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/MailListCD">https://bit.ly/MailListCD</a><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />LINKS:<br /><br />‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with the Game Industry‚Äù  <br />‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-09-04-whats-wrong-with-the-games-industry-and-how-to-fix-it">https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-09-04-whats-wrong-with-the-games-industry-and-how-to-fix-it</a><br /><br />Quora post on working in big tech, by Gideon Shavit <br />‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.quora.com/Since-software-engineers-who-work-at-FAANG-companies-like-Google-are-already-so-smart-when-they-join-the-company-do-they-really-get-to-learn-anything-seriously-challenging">https://www.quora.com/Since-software-engineers-who-work-at-FAANG-companies-like-Google-are-already-so-smart-when-they-join-the-company-do-they-really-get-to-learn-anything-seriously-challenging</a><br /><br />Startup failure rate<br />‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040915/how-many-startups-fail-and-why.asp">https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040915/how-many-startups-fail-and-why.asp</a><br /><br />Startup Stats ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.embroker.com/blog/startup-statistics/">https://www.embroker.com/blog/startup-statistics/</a><br /><br />Google research into team performance: Source: Google 2015             <br />‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.belbin.com/resources/blogs/belbin-and-project-aristotle-everything-you-need-to-know/">http://www.belbin.com/resources/blogs/belbin-and-project-aristotle-everything-you-need-to-know/</a><br /><br />State of DevOps report 2021<br />‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2021.pdf">https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2021.pdf</a><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />CHANNEL SPONSORS:<br /><br />Equal Experts is a product software development consultancy with a network of over 1,000 experienced technology consultants globally.
