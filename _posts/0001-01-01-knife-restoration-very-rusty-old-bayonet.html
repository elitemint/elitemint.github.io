{% raw %}An old rusty knife is the object in this restoration video with ASMR. The bayonet was in a very bad condition and I had to do a lot of rework, respectively restoration here. I had to remove rust (with electrolysis), weld, grind, file, drill, polish, turn on the lathe, glue and more.<br />▬ What did I do ?! ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ <br /><br />The knife was extremely rusty, so I used rust remover and a screwdriver to remove the coarse rust and electrolysis to remove the rest. Subsequently, I welded and ground the very deep pitting. I continued this restoration by hardening the blade and grinding it with sandpaper to 1200 grit and then polishing it. I also had to restore the handle for the most part by welding and grinding it. The new handle scales are made of oak, which were perfectly matched. For this I had to turn small bolts of brass on the lathe. Finally, everything was glued together and the shiny bayonet was ready.<br /><br />▬ Good to know ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ <br /><br />I used the following tools: pin punch, hammer, rust remover, pliers, welding machine, welding helmet, slag hammer, files, wire brush, propane torch, sandpaper, laboratory power supply, lathe, angle grinder, belt grinder, two-component glue<br /><br />▬ Special Thanks to my Members! ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ <br /><br />Debora Richards<br />Zamzuraini Zolkiple<br /><br />▬ Do you want to support me? ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ <br /><br />Would you like to become a channel member?
