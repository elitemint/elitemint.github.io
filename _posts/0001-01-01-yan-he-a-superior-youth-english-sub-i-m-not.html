{% raw %}I'm not going to keep digging to unearth {it} -- I just want to have some fun!<br /><br />Song title: 优越感少年 (A Superior Youth)<br />Composition/Arrange/Tuning: GhostFinal<br />Lyrics/Illustration/PV: Sya<br />Original upload: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.bilibili.tv/video/av644461/">http://www.bilibili.tv/video/av644461/</a><br /><br />First non-demo Yan He song?! GhostFinal is so fast aaaahhhhh<br /><br />I'm still in China, without access to Youtube (right now, a super awesome chicken is uploading for me ♥ ♥), so I can't reply to any comments or messages on Youtube. If you need to contact me, feel free to get in touch with me on Tumblr: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://shiwarabbit.tumblr.com/">http://shiwarabbit.tumblr.com/</a><br />I'm unexpectedly extremely busy right now :'( I actually had to pull an all-nighter to finish subbing this song, so please forgive any sleep-deprived (and not caffeine-fueled) mistakes. I actually finished this yesterday (like 22 hours ago), but due to various issues didn't upload until now. Sorry for the lateness!<br /><br />Also a note about the title: I used youth instead of boy since Yan He is a girl, so.... And superior in the sense of thinking of self as superior.{% endraw %}
