{% raw %}Police officers have been pictured clashing with Extinction Rebellion protestors at the annual Lord Mayor's Show in the City of London as the eco-mob launched fresh action criticising the COP26 climate conference. In clips shared widely across social media, spectators can be heard cheering as two police officers sprint up to a quartet of eco-warriors who are kneeling on the road with their hands held above their head. One member of the XR group appears to let his body go limp as one of the officers pulls him to the side of the road to allow the annual show to continue. Two elderly eco-activists, who appear to have paint on their faces, are seen being led away calmly by the arm by another police constable. Meanwhile, officers have been pictured holding back dozens more XR activists at other sections of the parade, while eco-activists wearing lab coats attempted to block roads with an installation featuring a large grey twisted hand and a disturbing-looking face.<br /><br />Original Article: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10198111/Police-drag-Extinction-Rebellion-protestors-Lord-Mayors-London.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10198111/Police-drag-Extinction-Rebellion-protestors-Lord-Mayors-London.html</a><br />Original Video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-2546819/Video-Bands-floats-annual-procession-Lord-Mayors-Show.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-2546819/Video-Bands-floats-annual-procession-Lord-Mayors-Show.html</a><br /><br />Daily Mail Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/dailymail">http://facebook.com/dailymail</a><br />Daily Mail IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/dailymail">http://instagram.com/dailymail</a><br />Daily Mail Snap: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033">https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033</a><br />Daily Mail Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/MailOnline">http://twitter.com/MailOnline</a><br />Daily Mail Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://pinterest.co.uk/dailymail">http://pinterest.co.uk/dailymail</a><br />Daily Mail Google+: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+DailyMail">https://plus.google.com/+DailyMail</a><br /><br />Get the free Daily Mail mobile app: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://dailymail.co.uk/mobile">http://dailymail.co.uk/mobile</a>{% endraw %}
