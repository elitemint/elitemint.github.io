{% raw %}✅ Google Tasks may not have all fancy features other to-do apps have, but it is heavily integrated within the Google ecosystem and that's where it really shines! In this video I share my Top 5 Google Tasks Tips to Stay Organized and show you how I use my Google Tasks lists on a daily basis<br /><br />If you currently use Google Tasks but would like to get more out of it, you've come to the right place. Very few people know that you can actually add a &quot;Room Task&quot; to a Google Chat Room, and assign tasks to others! Furthermore, you can &quot;convert&quot; emails from your Gmail homepage to Google Tasks very easily (by either dragging it over, or if you're on mobile, adding the email to a task list)<br /><br />Repeating Google Tasks may be easy to set up, but a little tricky to delete (but if you watch this video you'll know how 😉). Finally, I personally recommend NOT creating a Personal Tasks List and a Work Tasks Lists (Chrome Profiles is a much better solution) but rather create different lists for different projects! <br /><br />TIMESTAMPS<br />00:00 Tip 1 - Add Tasks from Gmail<br />00:53 Rename Google Tasks Title<br />01:03 Tip 2 - Assign Tasks to Others in Google Chat<br />01:58 Tip 3 - How to Delete Repeating Tasks<br />02:53 Tip 4 - Add Google Tasks to Google Calendar<br />03:42 How I use Google Tasks at Work<br />04:49 Tip 5 - Organize Google Task Lists by Projects<br /><br />RESOURCES I MENTION IN THE VIDEO<br />Google Chrome Video - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/KXY-2fIAksY">https://youtu.be/KXY-2fIAksY</a><br /><br />MY FAVORITE GEAR<br />🎥 My YouTube Gear - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/youtube-gear">https://geni.us/youtube-gear</a><br />🎒 What's In My Bag - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/mybag">https://geni.us/mybag</a><br />💻 What's On My Desk - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/mydesk">https://geni.us/mydesk</a><br />🛩 What I Travel With - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/mytravel">https://geni.us/mytravel</a><br /><br />MY FAVORITE SOFTWARE<br />✍️ Skillshare - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/skillshare-jeff">https://geni.us/skillshare-jeff</a><br />🎨 Canva - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://partner.canva.com/jeffsu">https://partner.canva.com/jeffsu</a><br /><br />BE MY FRIEND:<br />📧 Subscribe to my Productivity newsletter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jeffsu.org/productivity-pings/">https://www.jeffsu.org/productivity-pings/</a><br />📸 Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/j.sushie">https://instagram.com/j.sushie</a><br />🤝 LinkedIn - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jsu05/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jsu05/</a><br />👋🏻 Clubhouse - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/@jsushie">https://www.joinclubhouse.com/@jsushie</a><br /><br />👨🏻‍💻 WHO AM I:<br />I'm Jeff, a full time Product Marketer.
