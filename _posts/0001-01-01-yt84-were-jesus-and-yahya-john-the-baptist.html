We only teach the QurꜤan, using the Quranic methodology to extract knowledge from the Quran, exclusively!<br /><br />We rely on the organic Quranic methodology, on the Abrahamic locution, and on the nested interpretation techniques to uncover the meanings and indications of the Quran verses.<br /><br />The conclusion: When the Quran Tafseer scholars decided to bring their stories form corrupted versions of the earlier scriptures, they misled the Muslims from engaging the Quran in the way that Allahh had instructed us to do.<br /><br />Why are we presenting these topics on this channel? <br />1. Our primary mission on this channel is to teach this divine 3ilm (of the organic Quranic methodology + the Abrahamic locution) after it has been undocumented for 14 centuries<br />2. Please resist the urge of learning JUST for the sake of curiosity<br />3. The ultimate goal of learning this 3ilm is to teach you Shukoor (practicing proper communication with Allahh)<br />4. This channel is NOT to AFFIRM what you were taught, but to apply the methodology to seek the truth about the Quran.
