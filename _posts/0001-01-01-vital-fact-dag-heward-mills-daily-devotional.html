No wonder Isaiah says, “…people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge” (Isaiah 5:13, 14a).<br /><br />Nobody in their right minds would go to Hell if they really knew what it was all about. After all, most people want to serve God. That is why they practise religion. Actually, religion is man’s search for God. But Jesus is the only way to God. Anyone who desires to do business with God can only do so through Jesus (John 14:6, 1Timothy 2:5).<br /><br />Today, many churches are full of sincere people seeking God. But without the proper teaching from the pulpit about God’s plan of salvation, many churchgoers will be disappointed at the last trumpet. Speaking of the Jews, Paul testified that they indeed had a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge (Romans 10:2).<br /><br />What is God’s prescription for finding Heaven and avoiding Hell? Jesus said, “…Except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God” ( John 3:3). Being born again is not a new idea being propagated by some young churches. It is a fundamental, biblical instruction given by Christ to everyone!<br /><br />I also believe that every single Christian (especially pastors) will also give account to God, for withholding vital information about the reality of Hell from others. If souls are perishing because of ignorance, then those with knowledge will definitely be held accountable.{% endraw %}
