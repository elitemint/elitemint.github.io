{% raw %}Soft yet Strong Inflatable Structures for a Foldable and Portable Mobility<br />Hiroki Sato; Young ah Seong; Ryosuke Yamamura; Hiromasa Hayashi; Katsuhiro Hata; Hisato Ogata; Ryuma Niiyama; Yoshihiro Kawahara<br />CHI'20: ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems<br />Session: Interactivity<br />Abstract<br />We envision “Soft Mobility,” which is a new type of personal mobility made of soft, lightweight, and inflatable materials. A soft body enables safer user interactions with pedestrians and drivers; the lightweight and inflatable properties allow the users to easily carry it as a “portable device,” by deflating, folding, and packing it into, for example, a backpack. As embodiment of such soft mobility, we prototyped “poimo” (POrtable and Inflatable MObility). To evaluate the poimo, we first conducted mechanical tests to verify that it can endure the weight of a human. We also measured the time needed to inflate / deflate it to demonstrate its property. Finally, we reported on the preliminary results of riding on it, and clarified the requirements to further investigate and implement soft mobility transport.<br />DOI:: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3334480.3383147">https://doi.org/10.1145/3334480.3383147</a>{% endraw %}
