{% raw %}UP Yoddha Young Raider Played An Excellent Mind Game To Win The Match vs Patna Pirates | GBB Sports<br /><br />Kabaddi is a contact team sport. Played between two teams of seven players. The game's objective is for a single player on offense, referred to as a &quot;raider. He has to run into the opposing team's court, tag out as many of their defenders as possible, and return to their court. All without being tackled by the defenders and in a single breath. Points are scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider. Players are taken out of the game if they are tagged or tackled. But they are brought back in for each point scored by their team from a tag or tackle.<br /><br />It is popular in the Indian subcontinent and other surrounding Asian countries. Although accounts of kabaddi appear in the histories of ancient India, the game was popularised as a competitive sport in the 20th century. It is the national sport of Bangladesh. It is the state game of the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh.<br /><br />There are two significant disciplines of kabaddi: &quot;Punjabi kabaddi,&quot; also referred to as &quot;circle style,&quot; comprises traditional forms of the sport that are played on a circular field outdoors. In contrast, the &quot;standard style,&quot; played on a rectangular court indoors, is the discipline in major professional leagues and international competitions such as the Asian Games.<br /><br />________________________________________<br /><br />Visit Our Website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gbbstudios.in">https://gbbstudios.in</a><br />________________________________________<br /><br />Copyright Notice: Please feel free to leave me a notice if you find this upload inappropriate.
