{% raw %}This large south facing London garden has a stunning terrace at its centre, with dining and seating areas as well as a wonderful bespoke outdoor kitchen unit. Privacy and shade has been created with the planting of mature trees and the terrace also has a sense of enclosure, thanks to the full planting style in the beds that surround it. There is also a gorgeous secluded fire bowl area that leads to the impressive garden room.{% endraw %}
