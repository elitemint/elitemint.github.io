{% raw %}What if conquering your fears wasn't possible? Erin Kelley is 22, but has lived with a debilitating fear of vomiting since she was 7. Now a successful student leader and health coach, she shares what she's learned from her 15 years of panic attacks, disordered eating, and OCD. Contrary to popular belief, Erin explains why you cannot overcome your fears- and why trying to do so may even make it worse.  Erin Kelley, a 4th-year Psychology and Marketing student at the University of Cincinnati, plans to continue her education in Mental Health Counseling upon graduation. Erin recently launched a health coaching business for women seeking mental and physical wellness. She hopes to continue speaking on mental health in the future. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
