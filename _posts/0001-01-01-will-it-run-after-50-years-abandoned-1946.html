{% raw %}Join in with the Restored Crew as they pick back up on this abandoned 1946 International KB1 truck they recently rescued from the woods. Sitting over 50 years without running, the guys dig in and discover a long list of obstacles they must cross off before they're able to see if there's any life left in her. Will they be able to get this 75-year-old piece of machinery to live again, or was there a reason this thing was parked many years ago?<br /><br />►►SUBSCRIBE HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa422iqMhGLDX6GVC1gxxlA?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa422iqMhGLDX6GVC1gxxlA?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />►►Follow Us On Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/kravenedkustom">https://www.facebook.com/kravenedkustom</a><br /><br />►►Interested in becoming a Restored YouTube Member? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/32oydR8">https://bit.ly/32oydR8</a><br />►Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.be-restored.com">https://www.be-restored.com</a><br />►►Interested In Donating To The Restored Crew? : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3eRTDuN">https://bit.ly/3eRTDuN</a><br /><br />►►Any business enquires can be sent to: kravenedkustoms@live.com<br /><br />** Like To Send Us Mail?<br />Lance &amp; Wyatt Bush<br />P.O Box 865, Bogata Tx, 75417<br /><br />#willitrun #international #restored{% endraw %}
