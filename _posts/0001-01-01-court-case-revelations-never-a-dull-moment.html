{% raw %}Never a dull moment in Montecito for this couple!! or New York in this case!! We saw Harry talking on the REWIRED Conference about the dangers of social media and also revealed that he KNEW that there was going to be trouble in Washington the day before it happened!! So concerned was he that trouble was brewing that he sent an email to the Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey who subsequently never responded and Harry was unable to do anything to stop trouble from unfolding.... perhaps try the authorities next time.<br /><br />Now whilst Harry was in New York, Meghan has appeared on New York Times Dealbook to discuss various questions thrown at her in a 30 minute interview, her first since Oprah. I must say she had amazing hair!!!!<br /><br />But even her coiffed gorgeous locks could not distract from what was unfolding in the ANL Court case! New revelations that prove several people have been telling yet more porky pies!!<br /><br />Taz xx{% endraw %}
