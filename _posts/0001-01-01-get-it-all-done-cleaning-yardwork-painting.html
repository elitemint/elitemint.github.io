{% raw %}Getting it all done in this video! The garage, which is more of a living space for us, needed cleaning up. We were going to be having company over for a bbq and the back yard needed to be ready for guests, I threw in my Costco grocery haul, and finally painted that little bathroom that had swatches all over it for months. Put it all together to share the motivation with you. <br /><br />- - S U B S C R I B E - - <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/intentfulspaces">https://www.youtube.com/c/intentfulspaces</a><br /><br />- -  I N S T A G R A M - -  Sharing lots over there!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/intentfulspaces/">https://www.instagram.com/intentfulspaces/</a> <br /><br />- - MY  A M A Z O N  S H O P - - So many links all in one place! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/intentfulspaces">https://www.amazon.com/shop/intentfulspaces</a> <br /><br />* E-CLOTH * <br />I am proud to be an e-cloth partner! <br />Love, love, love their concept + products. <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ecloth.sjv.io/5bb3g2">https://ecloth.sjv.io/5bb3g2</a><br /><br />* GROVE COLLABORATIVE * <br />I get many of my cleaning products from them to save some money and have more options.
