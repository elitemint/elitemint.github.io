{% raw %}From Bosnia to Iraq the Warrior IFV has served with distinction for many decades so its no surprise the British Army is having such a hard time finding a replacement. In this video find out why this historic troop carrier is such an outstanding vehicle. It has a 30mm autocannon on top and can drive 10 miles per hour faster than the American Military's M2 Bradley. It can also fit one extra dismounted soldier. Mechanized infantry love this armored military vehicle. <br /><br />Follow Chris Cappy on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/cappyarmy/">https://www.instagram.com/cappyarmy/</a><br /><br />Follow Elliot Hearne: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hearnelliot/">https://www.instagram.com/hearnelliot/</a><br /><br />Task &amp; Purpose is a military news and culture oriented channel.
