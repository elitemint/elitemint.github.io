{% raw %}We can‚Äôt believe another year is over and 2021 has certainly been an interesting one. Here is a compilation of our favourite and some never before seen outtakes, bloopers and funny moments from making our 2021 videos. We always wanted our channel to be ‚Äúreal life‚Äù in a real machining workshop and this compilation certainly shows that, from Kurtis's way with words, to the many different interruptions, to the lost tools and issues with the welder. Creating videos is a lot of work and we aren‚Äôt sure who struggled more‚Ä¶Kurtis dealing with Karen, or Karen dealing with Kurtis üòÇ what we do know is we had a big year of growth with lots of successful interesting jobs and Homeless our Safety Officer shop dog was very much spoilt by his fans! Thank you for all the support this year, we wish all our subscribers &amp; viewers a Happy New Year and here‚Äôs hoping 2022 is better for us all.<br />Cheers! <br />Kurtis, Karen &amp; Homey<br /><br />Join our channel:<br />We upload new videos every Friday at 5pm AEST!
