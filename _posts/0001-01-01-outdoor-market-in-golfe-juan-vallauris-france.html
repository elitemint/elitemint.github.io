{% raw %}Outdoor market in Golfe-Juan every Friday... It is similar to a flea market. You can find a lot of different stuff like clothes, shoes, bags, accessories, house wear, food &amp; more... <br />I love going to the market because you can bargain &amp; negotiate the price....<br />The market in the village of Golfe-Juan in Vallauris, regularly on Fridays, open at 9:00 am &amp; close at around 12:30 pm.<br /><br />#fruits<br />#vegetables<br />#clothes<br />#shoes<br />#bags<br /><br /><br /><br />Enjoy watching guys!{% endraw %}
