{% raw %}Welcome to our YouTube channel, solely dedicated to words. <br /><br />Say Your Word is a digital platform by the acclaimed novelist, storyteller and women’s rights activist Elif Shafak.<br />A platform for words and anyone who cares about them. <br /><br />Language is the key to understanding and unlocking our world. <br />It is also the key to the human heart. <br /><br />Words are often said to have power. <br />What is not said that often is that they can hurt and even spread hatred and hostility, just like they can heal and bring about love, empathy and wisdom. <br />They can divide, distance and &quot;dehumanise&quot;, just like they can connect and “rehumanise&quot; those who have been dehumanised. <br /><br />East and West, North and South, regardless of race, sex, gender, colour, religion, ethnicity, nationality or any other category, we are all made of stories. <br />Stories bring us together, untold stories keep us apart. <br /><br />Today's word is #SORRY.<br /> <br />Subscribe to Elif Shafak's new YouTube channel to discover the beauty, complexity and magic of words. <br />You can follow us on Elif Shafak's social media channels.<br /> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shafakelif/">https://www.instagram.com/shafakelif/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Elif_Safak">https://twitter.com/Elif_Safak</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Elif.Shafak">https://www.facebook.com/Elif.Shafak</a><br /><br />Say Your Word by Wordstudios<br />Director: Eyüp Sağlık<br />Videographer: Ferhat Elik<br />Channel Manager: Emine Civanoğlu <br />Social Media: Ajans Gusta | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ajansgusta">https://www.youtube.com/user/ajansgusta</a><br />Singer: Fatma Turgut | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP1hFdyaMSbXHWfGhegaU3Q">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP1hFdyaMSbXHWfGhegaU3Q</a>{% endraw %}
