{% raw %}In this book Henry writes, &quot;Next to the beauty of holiness, which is the soul's agreement with God, is the beauty of meekness, which is the soul's agreement with itself. Behold how good and how pleasant a thing it is for the powers of the soul to dwell in unity, the reason knowing how to rule, and the affections at the same time knowing how to obey.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />   1. The Nature of Meekness and Quietness of Spirit<br /><br />         1. We must be of a meek spirit<br /><br />               1. There is meekness toward God when there is an easy and quiet submission to his will<br /><br />               2. There is meekness toward our brethren where the fruit of the spirit abides<br /><br />         2. We must be of a quiet spirit<br /><br />               1. We must be quiet as the air is quiet from winds<br /><br />               2. We must be quiet as the sea is quiet from waves<br /><br />               3. We must be quiet as the land is quiet from war<br /><br />               4. We must be quiet as the child is quiet after weening<br /><br /><br /><br />   2. The Excellency of Meekness and Quietness of Spirit<br /><br />         1. Consider how creditable a meek and quiet spirit is<br /><br />         2. Consider how comfortable a meek and quiet spirit is<br /><br />         3. Consider how profitable a meek and quiet spirit is<br /><br />         4. Consider what a preparative it is for something further<br /><br /><br /><br />   3. Application<br /><br />         1. Shouldn't we be saddened for the lack of the character of meekness and quietness of spirit among believers?<br /><br />               1. We are prone to scold those that we lead because of a lack of meekness<br /><br />               2. We are prone to vex those who lead us becuase of a lack of meekness<br /><br />               3. We are prone to clash and complain against our peers because of a lack of meekness<br /><br />         2. Isn't there a grand reason to work and endeavor for this character since there is such virtue and praise to attain these things?<br /><br />               1. Scripture precepts concerning meekness<br /><br />               2. Some patterns of meekness<br /><br />               3. Some examples of the need for meekness<br /><br />               4. Some good principles that we should abide by<br /><br />               5. Methods by which to grow in the grace of meekness{% endraw %}
