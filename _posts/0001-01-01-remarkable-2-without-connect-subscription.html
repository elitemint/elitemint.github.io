{% raw %}Unboxin remarkable 2 and my thoughts on whether it is any good!  Thoughts about subscription plan.  I'm using remarkable as my daily planner, notepad and sketchbook.<br /><br />It's great if you remeber it is just to replace a notebook.<br />Accessories in the video:<br />The folio cover: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/30K8kxf">https://amzn.to/30K8kxf</a><br />The Lamy EMR marker:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3e7fEWO">https://amzn.to/3e7fEWO</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Remove paper from your life.<br />Be better than paper.<br />No search, TOC etc.<br />Limited reader.<br /><br />Banging premium feel.<br />Great battery.<br />Slick notebook.<br />Endless pages.<br />Cloud access.<br />Share screen.<br />Draw.<br />Visual, digital communication of ideas.<br />Without the iPad LCD eyestrain.<br />Doesn't feel like shipping out a computer, less digital barrier.<br /><br />Yes, I think it's well worth it.<br />Can't drop everything, but if you still find yourself using a notepad / planner, then this is better.{% endraw %}
