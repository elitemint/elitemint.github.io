Here are just a few of the reasons that producing our products within America leads to direct and indirect benefits for our company and our customers.<br /><br />More Jobs and A Stronger Economy: Buying American-made goods doesn’t just support the workers who make those goods, but ripples out through the entire economy. When American factories prosper, they hire American construction firms to expand their buildings, American accounting firms to handle their money, and American energy suppliers to provide them with power. The EPI estimates that every U.S. manufacturing job supports an additional 1.4 jobs in other parts of the economy. <br />Lower Carbon Footprint: Products made overseas have a higher carbon footprint than U.S.-made goods. Goods made in China or India have to be shipped across the ocean to reach American stores, burning fossil fuel and emitting greenhouse gases with every mile they travel.<br />Less Pollution: Many developing countries have few or no regulations to protect the health of the air and water in the surrounding area. By choosing to produce in America, where these regulations are set in place, we support these communities and the environment as a whole. <br />Human Rights: In addition to having weaker environmental regulations, these countries often have no laws to protect the rights of workers. We choose to produce where we know our workers will be supported and protected.<br />Health: The lack of environmental and safety regulations overseas doesn’t just put foreign workers at risk – it can also threaten the health of American consumers. The health of our community is of utmost importance and priority to us. <br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.moneycrashers.com/products-made-usa-american-made/">https://www.moneycrashers.com/products-made-usa-american-made/</a><br /><br />But it’s not just about the WHAT we manufacture, it’s the HOW. That’s why Pelican Products has pushed for a holistic approach to our corporate culture and manufacturing practices. For our company, that means corporate dedication to Sustainability, Product Design, Operations, Safety, Ethics, Quality and Philanthropy. We have taken significant steps to enhance our sustainability practices and policies, and are working diligently to do more.<br /><br />Shop all Pelican products here: www.Pelican.com/shop{% endraw %}
