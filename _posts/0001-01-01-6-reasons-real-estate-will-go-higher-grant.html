{% raw %}A lot of people are predicting another housing crash or Real Estate bubble, but I feel confident the value of properties will only go higher and here's why. <br />1) INTEREST RATES ARE AT AN ALL TIME LOW<br />Investors are investing in single family homes as a rental stock to take advantage of record low interest rates.<br />2) SUPPLY ISSUES<br />Builders can build apartments faster and make more money than a lot of single family homes.<br />3) THE RETURN OF THE INTERNATIONAL BUYER<br />When travel is more open and accommodating again, you'll see investors come in to do their due diligence.<br />4) MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MIGRATION<br />In Florida for example, we have record numbers of people migrating from California and other States.<br />5) INFLATION<br />Since there has been global printing of money, surpassing $17 trillion, Real Estate will be affected by the inflation. <br />6) DEMAND FOR YIELD<br />With interest rates at an all time low, people are looking for a place to put their money that yields returns other than the bank.<br /><br />#realestate #inflation<br />-----<br />This is not an offer, solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell securities nor a recommendation to buy or sell any securities.
