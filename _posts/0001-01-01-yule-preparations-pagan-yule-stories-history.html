{% raw %}#yule #yuletraditions #paganchristmas<br /><br />In today's witch vlog I want to take you through my preparations for Yule. <br />And while I am decorating for Christmas and Yule, I would like to share some of the pagan origins of Christmas traditions with you too. And maybe give you some inspiration on how to celebrate Yule or how to prepare for it. It is that magical time of year again, filled with the scent of dried oranges and freshly baked Christmas cookies, the sounds of the softly crunching snow under my boots, and twinkle lights in the windows - I absolutely adore Winter! How are you celebrating Yule and have you gotten your Christmas tree yet?<br /><br />How are we preparing for Yule?<br />00:00 Intro<br />00:23 What are we doing in today's witch vlog?<br />00:59 Walk through a winter wonderland<br />01:47 Yuletide and the wild hunt<br />02:53 Christmas traditions and their pagan origin<br />03:57 Bavarian / Austrian Christmas figures with pagan roots<br />05:26 Warming up with Spiced Orange tea<br />06:23 Simple kitchen witch spell for winter days<br />07:12 Thor's connection to the winter solstice<br />09:54 Pagan kitchen witchery: Thomas wheels / Yule wagon recipe<br />12:25 When to cut your Yule tree according to the Lunar calendar<br />14:17 Getting our tree <br />15:02 Christmas ornaments and their pagan origins <br />16:40 Ideas for an enchanted witchy Yule tree<br />18:30 Decorating for Christmas and Yule<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />This is the tree farm where we got our tree: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pressather-tannenland.de/">http://www.pressather-tannenland.de/</a><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èMy favorite WITCHY THINGS &amp; equipment: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kit.co/The_witches_cookery">https://www.kit.co/The_witches_cookery</a><br /><br />üìö My favorite witchy books: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kit.co/The_witches_cookery/witchcraft-books">https://kit.co/The_witches_cookery/witchcraft-books</a><br /><br />üì∑ Join me on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/the_witches_cookery">https://www.instagram.com/the_witches_cookery</a><br /><br />üíï If you would like to receive more content or interact with me on a more personal level, feel invited to have a look at my Patreon account: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patreon.com/the_witches_cookery">https://patreon.com/the_witches_cookery</a><br /><br />‚òï If you'd like to support this channel and make it possible for me to create more content for your enjoyment: paypal.me/thewitchescookery<br /><br />‚úâ If you¬¥d like to send me snail mail: Rebekka Laufer, Postfach 17, 92246 Vilseck<br /><br />üéµ Music from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/6xy6n9/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/6xy6n9/</a><br /><br />Might contain affiliate links, meaning that I earn a veeeery small percentage from them.
