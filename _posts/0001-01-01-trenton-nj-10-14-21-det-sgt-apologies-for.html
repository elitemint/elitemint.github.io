{% raw %}Apologies for the video footage.<br /><br />On October 14, 2021, I went to the City Clerks' office to do a public records request under OPRA to obtain body camera footage, etc.. from the recent encounter with the Trenton police... I was met by Matthew Conlon, the city clerk, who can be reached at Phone: 609-989-3187.  I told him the website was not legal as it requires a name and to check off whether or not you have been convicted... etc.. he was very argumentative, did not care, and was very hostile.  Soon after, the municipal building's security arrived.  He had no idea what was going on, Hendricks.  Then came along Detective Sargent, Badge number 79, Torres who also is on the mayor's detail and should know that people are allowed to record in a public building and should know Ramos v. Flowers as Herb Flowers is a cop in Trenton.   An  Internal Affairs complaint has been signed.  The Internal Affairs officer agreed that anyone can record in the public building, in a public lobby.<br />Detective Sergeant Torres, Badge number 79, decided to rip the phone from my hands and grabbed me, and shoved me out of the building.  He claims it is not a crime because he returned my cell phone to me, he had no right to take my phone and delete the video (had to retrieve it later on) and force me out of a public building and a public lobby.  2C:13-1  Kidnapping.<br /><br />2C:13-1. Kidnapping. a. Holding for ransom, reward or as a hostage. A person is guilty of kidnapping if he unlawfully removes another from the place where he is found.<br /><br />I shall return.<br /><br />As of today, November 14, 2021, the City Clerk has filed a lawsuit against the city, the mayor, the local newspaper, and a reporter for that newspaper (The Trentonian).  This clerk has sued multiple places that he has been employed by, allegedly.  The local councilwoman has also stated that Mr. Conlon is a racist and a white supremacist as reported by the Trentonian, allegedly.  As you see his attitude and demeanor, he should not be working for the citizens.{% endraw %}
