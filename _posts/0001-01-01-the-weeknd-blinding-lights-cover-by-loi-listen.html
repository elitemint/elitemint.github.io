{% raw %}Listen to &quot;Blinding Lights&quot; NOW!!! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://loi.lnk.to/BlindingLights">https://loi.lnk.to/BlindingLights</a><br /><br />It‘s no question that TheWeeknd’s „Blinding Lights“ is an absolute smash. Loi was well aware of that when she covered the song in a short snippet on social media in april. With her soft and unique tone of voice and the bare piano backing she puts her own emotional spin on the track. And it was received well... It was so well received that the sound snippet sparked a trend in Brazil on TikTok which expanded globally. Right now the sound has over 200.000 video creations with a total of 330 million views.<br />The positive feedback and the request for more led Loi to releasing a full version. <br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />► Follow me:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Loi_IG​">https://bit.ly/Loi_IG​</a><br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Loi_TikTok​">https://bit.ly/Loi_TikTok​</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Loi_facebook​">https://bit.ly/Loi_facebook​</a><br /><br />►Camera Director: Samuel B.
