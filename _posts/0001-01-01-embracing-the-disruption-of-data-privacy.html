{% raw %}Recent enforcement of data privacy laws and regulations is prompting organizations to reconsider how they manage data. In this session, we will discuss how an anticipated explosion of data creation coupled with expanding data privacy laws and regulations is impacting governance practices. As these factors collide, businesses can prepare for the tsunami effect of responding to Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs) and global privacy laws by adopting robust data standards and governance practices, favoring modern frameworks, and incorporating automation and technical resources. <br /><br />We will demonstrate how incorporating data privacy practices into a governance program benefits your organization when working with both external data protection authorities and internal business stakeholders by:<br /><br />    Re-defining components of a data inventory; what is in your catalog? <br />    Establishing stronger meta-data standards and practices<br />    Leveraging Critical Data Element (CDE) practices<br />    Controlling data lineage, transformation, and proliferation<br />    Managing principles of artificial intelligence/machine learning when personal or regulated data is used<br /><br />With Julie Park &amp; Paula Olsen of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints{% endraw %}
