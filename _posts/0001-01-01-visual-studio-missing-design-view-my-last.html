Then, I'm not sure how this happened but the next time I went to view a web page all I could see was the code view at 100%. Viewing the code is great (and necessary) but I like to flip over to design mode (without opening in a browser) to see if I have coded my div tags correctly. This little issue put a stop to my wanting to go any further before correcting this problem. I thought it would be an option in the View (from the top menu strip) but I couldn't find it there. I ran over the ask my best friend (aka Google) how the heck to get my design / source / split tabs back. I came across someone asking this on Stack Exchange but the answer was lacking. So after messing around for about 30 minutes until I finally stumbled across the answer of how to get the design tab back, I decided I should make a video - not only as a reminder for myself - in case this ever happens again - but also to hopefully help some other person out there STUCK or maybe even freaking out about how to get their design or split screen tab back. Hope you enjoy the video. Feel free to leave a comment below. Oh, and I will go post a link to this video back on that question page I found on Stack Exchange.<br /><br />STAY CALM AND CODE ON! <br />Link to my Entire Playlist on YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXxFa7zw6ZluhQ1QWQc6ibg3QYB6X_FN2">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXxFa7zw6ZluhQ1QWQc6ibg3QYB6X_FN2</a>{% endraw %}
