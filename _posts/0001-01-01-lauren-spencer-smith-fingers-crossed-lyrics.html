{% raw %}Lauren Spencer-Smith - Fingers Crossed<br /><br />'Fingers Crossed' Lyrics:<br />[Verse 1]<br />Introduced me to your family<br />Watched my favourite shows on your TV<br />Made me breakfast in the morning<br />When you got home from work<br />Making plans to travel 'round the world<br />Said we'd always put each other first<br />Old love songs we used to play to<br />Funny now I hate you<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Now, I remember when you'd call me late at night<br />I gave you my hours and advice, just tryna fix you<br />And all your daddy issues<br />But now I don't even miss you anymore<br />So I, I want all the tears back that I cried<br />All the hours spent giving advice on how to write your songs<br />All you did was prove me wrong<br />When you said you loved me<br />Well you must've had your fingers crossed<br /><br />[Post-Chorus]<br />Oh-oh, oh-oh<br />Your fingers crossed<br /><br /><br />[Verse 2]<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus]<br />I could say I'm sorry, but I'm not<br />You don't deserve the one thing that you lost<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Now, I remember when you'd call me late at night<br />I gave you my hours and advice, just tryna fix you<br />And all your daddy issues<br />But now I don't even miss you anymore<br />So I, I want all the tears back that I cried<br />All the hours spent giving advice on how to write your songs<br />All you did was prove me wrong<br />When you said you loved me<br />Well you must've had your fingers crossed<br /><br />[Post-Chorus] [?]<br />Oh-oh, oh-oh<br />Your fingers crossed<br /><br />#LaurenSpencerSmith #FingersCrossed #Lyrics{% endraw %}
