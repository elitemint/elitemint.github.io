{% raw %}Many birds are beautiful and fun to look at but don’t underestimate them. Some birds are fearless predators that can wreak havoc. Have you ever seen a magpie in action? What about a stork? If you want to see some deadly birds, keep watching as we countdown 15 horrific moments of birds eating birds<br /><br />► Subscribe For New Videos! ► shorturl.at/krBX9 <br /><br />Watch our “11 Dogs That Can Defeat Wild Animals”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/B2pInEkOvvo">https://youtu.be/B2pInEkOvvo</a><br />Watch our “12 Most Insane Giant Robots On Earth”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/DTQfw8FKF0o">https://youtu.be/DTQfw8FKF0o</a><br />Watch our “20 Beach Moments If Not Filmed, You Wouldn't Believe”<br />video here:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/OI_a6JIe2a0">https://youtu.be/OI_a6JIe2a0</a><br /><br />Caracara Attacks<br /><br />On the Falkland Islands, avian parents must remain vigilant. Caracaras are on the lookout, and an unattended nest can quickly turn into a buffet for these ferocious carnivores. The Johnny Rook is a bird that gets right in your face. These cunning animals, known as the 'flying devils' are the Caracara of the Falkland Islands, and they gather with their young to scare both large and tiny species. They are fearless birds.<br /><br />Skua<br /><br />Skuas are among the most hazardous bird predators in Antarctica. Adult skuas eat penguins, especially their young, but even adults. Blood is streaming out of this newborn penguin as a skua pokes holes in it. After killing it, the skua consumes it. This skua is attempting to assault these three juvenile penguins, but the penguins team up to repel the skua. They're terrified of the skua, but every now and then, one of the charges the predator, causing him to flee. The penguins aren't going down without a fight. They continue to back up, but they do not allow the skua to harm them. The skua becomes irritated, and the penguins eventually persuade it to leave them alone. A brown skua outsmarts a female penguin who is in the middle of incubating two eggs, stealing one of them. As shown in this video, skuas frequently search for newborn penguins alone, and the penguins either flee or challenge the skua. It all depends on how they are feeling at the time, in my opinion{% endraw %}
