Lauderdale, FL. In its inception, the church formerly known as the Plantation Worship Center, began with a membership of only 11, holding services in a local school cafeteria. In 2002, the 10,000-plus members of The Faith Center Ministries made their church home in the Sunrise Musical Theater and embraced their mission to reach the world for Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Subscribe to The Faith Center  Ministries to stream his latest messages from over the years, and much more!
