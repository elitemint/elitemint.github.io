{% raw %}Apparently this version was nowhere to be found, so I figured it would be a good idea to upload it here.<br />You're welcome. <br /><br />'It came upon a Midnight Clear' was released on the Christmas compilation album, &quot;Maybe This Christmas Too?'  It was also heard on the second season of Grey's Anatomy. 2x12: &quot;Grandma got run over by a reindeer.&quot;{% endraw %}
