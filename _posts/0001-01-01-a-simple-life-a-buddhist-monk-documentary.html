{% raw %}A Simple Life | A Buddhist Monk Documentary<br /><br />With so much chaos in the world, is it possible to have peace? According to Buddhist monks, the answer is yes. This video documents a day in the life of a Theravada Buddhist monk in Thailand. It follows him as he goes on alms round through the local village, doing his chores, practice mindfulness and meditation, and so much more. My intention for this video is to give you a small glimpse into our world and hopefully it inspires you to diligently train your mind and build your habits. For world peace to be achieved, it must first start with inner peace. Developing inner peace takes effort, time, patience, and endurance, but it's a journey worth going on. I hope you enjoy! #monks #buddhist #mindfulness<br /><br />Special thanks to Venerable Santosh<br />Script co-edited by Venerable Michael<br /><br />***<br />‚úÖ Venerable Nick‚Äôs Website:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nickkeomahavong.com/">https://www.nickkeomahavong.com/</a><br /><br />***<br /><br />üî∂ Experience ‚ÄúThe Monk Life Project‚Äù, a temporary ordination program for International men in Thailand:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.themonklife.org/">https://www.themonklife.org/</a><br /><br />üî∂ Join our meditation retreat in Chiang Mai, Thailand:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.papaemeditation.org/en/">http://www.papaemeditation.org/en/</a><br /><br />***<br />Get a copy of Venerable Nick's Books:<br /><br />‚úÖ The Buddhist Cleanse: The 1-Day Spiritual Detox <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Buddhist-Cleanse-1-Day-Spiritual-Detox-ebook/dp/B08V1Y6STX">https://www.amazon.com/Buddhist-Cleanse-1-Day-Spiritual-Detox-ebook/dp/B08V1Y6STX</a><br /><br />***<br />üî¥ Stay updated with any new resources, products, or other announcements by signing up for Nick Keomahavong‚Äôs mailing list:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3aVWRx0">https://bit.ly/3aVWRx0</a><br /><br />***<br />üî¥ Join our Online Reddit Community:<br /><br />On Reddit, we keep the conversation going.
