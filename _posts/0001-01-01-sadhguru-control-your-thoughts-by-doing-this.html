{% raw %}With My Own Story  In This Video at 04:40 Minute.<br /><br />Taking the time to reflect can completely change difficult situations<br />If we look at this same situation another way, it makes a lot more sense, and allows for improvement.<br /><br /><br />What Self-Awareness Means<br />Being mindful, conscious, and reflective<br />If you’ve ever been to a yoga class, you know there’s a lot of talk about mindfulness, and being aware of your own emotions. Self-awareness really encompasses mindfulness. It’s being conscious of and reflecting on your own character, feelings, motivations, and desires.<br /><br /><br />Why You Need It<br />You can't improve if you aren't self-aware<br />Self-awareness allows you to understand your own emotions and why you react to situations in certain ways. We all know that feeling when we get angry because something went wrong. We deflect that anger and blame it on other people. They did something _to us_that was wrong.<br /><br /><br />Sadhguru Speech :- this self-esteem this self-confidence all these things unfortunately have been sold a lot on the planet why do you need esteem why do you need esteem esteem is because you want to be little one upon somebody else all the time unfortunately our education systems were made like this right from kindergarten who is first who is second who's third you want to be first<br /><br /><br /> Video Editing Information :- Video Edited With Clips And Special Effects. <br /><br /><br />The Purpose Of This Video Is To Demonstrate And Create A Creatively Unique Vision And Giving New Meaning.
