It leads to a desire to learn and therefore a tendency to: embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks and learn from criticism.<br /><br />People with a fixed mindset believe intelligence is static. It leads to a desire to look smart and therefore a tendency to: avoid challenges, give up easily, ignore feedback and see effort as fruitless.<br /><br />We should strive to put ourselves and others in to growth mindset every time we face an obstacle!<br /><br />Which mindset do you have?{% endraw %}
