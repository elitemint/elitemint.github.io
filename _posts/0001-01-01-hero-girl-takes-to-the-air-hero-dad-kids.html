{% raw %}As Dad and Miao stroll through the park, the wind suddenly opens Dad's umbrella, blowing it away and out of control, kicking off a musical number of intricate choreography between Dad and Miao as they try to regain control of, and close, the umbrella. Miao finally has the ingenious idea to tie the umbrella closed!<br /><br />Every day, to transform out of his secret identity as a mild mannered suburban father, DAD dons rubber kitchen gloves, a speedo and rubber rain boots over his jeans, a tablecloth for a cape, and the pièce of résistance, a silly blue “hero” mask over his eyes… and voilà! DAD is now HERO DAD!! In every episode, DAD teaches MIAO how to solve challenging situations that every 3-year-old has to face: Do superheroes wash their hands before eating? Why wouldn’t superheroes throw trash on the ground? Are superheroes brave even if they like to sleep with a little night light?<br /><br />HERO DAD guides MIAO through the everyday lessons of a 3-year-old’s life, as a superhero… albeit a clumsy superhero that’s always getting himself into trouble! He is supposed to be the hero, but he always ends up being saved by MIAO, who in turn learns the lesson of the day in the best way possible: laughing and having so much fun with her DAD!{% endraw %}
