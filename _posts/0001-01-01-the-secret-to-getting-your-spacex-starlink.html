{% raw %}Starlink is allowing transfer of services. <br />This is HUGE news!<br />Ok, it might not be a secret anymore, but thanks to a friend on reddit who reached out to Starlink, we now know this is an option!<br />Here is what the user posted:<br />I just posted a couple hours back asking about how to sell my Dishy, transferring ownership, etc.I decided to ask Support and see what they recommend doing, and to my surprise they have told me that they're just beginning to accept ownership transfers now! This is huge news.<br /><br />Attached is the e-mail I received from support moments ago (11/11/2021):<br />&quot;Hello, Thank you for reaching out to Starlink support. We will be more than happy to assist you with your questions and very good questions they are. As you stated we do not have a buy back program as of yet but that may be something that we offer in the future, thank you for asking. However, we have recently started a transfer program where a Starlink customer can transfer their equipment to another person. There are a few requirements and we would need some information about the new customer. When you are ready to transfer the account has to be in good standing and we would need the customers email address and the new customers intended service address. Please note, the new owner will need to know this account number in order to proceed so please be sure to share that information with them. In addition, Starlink is not responsible for anything related to the selling of the dish. We will be closing the ticket at this time but please reach back out when you are ready with the required information. We are looking forward to hearing back from you.&quot;<br /><br />--------------------------------<br />HI!
