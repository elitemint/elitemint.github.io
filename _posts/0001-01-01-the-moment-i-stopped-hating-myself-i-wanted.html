{% raw %}I wanted for some time to create something around the concept of interacting with my past self, so this is my attempt to capture this idea. This entire video was shot in an art studio and the red liquid is obviously paint. The theme of the video and the poem is definitely dark. The brutal way I chose to showcase this idea, I think empowers the positive message this poem ends with. I hope you relate to some part of it and I hope it helps.  <br /><br />Forever Humbled,<br />A kid with a camera<br /><br />🔰Support me on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/illneas">https://www.patreon.com/illneas</a><br /><br />🔰Find me here 🔗<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/_illneas/">https://www.instagram.com/_illneas/</a><br />                            🔗<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/illneas/">https://www.facebook.com/illneas/</a><br />                            🔗<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/illneas">https://twitter.com/illneas</a><br />                            🔗<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6RXfBqGg0YwfM7jVCTq79W?si=hyG3S2oXTH-7HW_pIsH_zw">https://open.spotify.com/artist/6RXfBqGg0YwfM7jVCTq79W?si=hyG3S2oXTH-7HW_pIsH_zw</a><br /><br />Second channel<br />🔗<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3urbsMSDr9XmgtnFdWZe_Q">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3urbsMSDr9XmgtnFdWZe_Q</a><br /><br />🔰Communities <br />-<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/kfxthmS3F4">https://discord.gg/kfxthmS3F4</a><br />-<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2314655172176122/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/2314655172176122/</a><br />-<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchingformeaning/">https://www.reddit.com/r/searchingformeaning/</a><br /><br />-The narrator is Tyler<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.artstation.com/sunshine-tm">https://www.artstation.com/sunshine-tm</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Tyleross_">https://twitter.com/Tyleross_</a><br /><br />-The music <br />Libys - Η Γη είναι ένα κρύο νεκρό μέρος<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2RpcoO5K68irxNiRHVLvpy?si=e3688f573c694908">https://open.spotify.com/track/2RpcoO5K68irxNiRHVLvpy?si=e3688f573c694908</a><br /><br />🔰My equipment: <br />I film handheld with a Panasonic Lumix <br />G80<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2uGqmQZ">https://amzn.to/2uGqmQZ</a><br />GX80<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/33e5Tye">https://amzn.to/33e5Tye</a><br />📷Olympus M.Zuiko Digital 45mm F1.8 Lens  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2vr9P3N">https://amzn.to/2vr9P3N</a><br /><br />🔰The Moment I Stopped Hating Myself by illneas<br /><br />Dear Past Self,<br />before you give up,<br />look at yourself in the mirror without the illusion of time <br /><br />Look as if the distance between us <br />could be counted in fading scars,<br />not seconds <br /><br />Before you abandon hope, remember that being enough, <br />has less to do with who you are, <br />and more with who you could be <br /><br />Before you give in to the voices in your head, <br />I need to tell you that your ideas will never silence <br /><br />So try to reshape them, <br />let them radiate through you<br /><br />Before you become bitter with people,<br />Understand that loneliness is nothing compared to unshared happiness <br /><br />The world is full of beautiful people <br />in the most unexpected ways, <br />so learn to trust them <br /><br />Sometimes I wish you could see yourself through my eyes <br />And then I realize that you will <br /><br />For now, stare into the mirror in front of you<br />as if you could realize that imperfection is another human construct <br /><br />And if you still want to give up<br />If you still want to give in to those voices<br />if you still go to bed hoping that you will never wake up <br /><br />Place your hand on your heart <br />and feel the blood inside of us <br /><br />Let each breath carry you into the future <br />until we become one<br /><br />I assure you, <br />it gets better<br /><br />And even if you disagree with me, <br />keep in mind that<br />I will always be proud of you{% endraw %}
