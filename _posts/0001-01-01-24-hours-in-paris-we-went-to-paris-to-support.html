{% raw %}We went to Paris to support our cameraguy and friend Milan at the Paris marathon. And while we were there, why not just make a Paris vlog. We visited all the classic Paris things like Arc De Triomphe, The Louvre, The Eiffel Tower but most importantly the Cumforrest in Bois de la Boulogne. I bet you haven't heard of that one yet. Enjoy the video!<br /><br />THANKS FOR WATCHING ❤️<br /><br />SHOP THE MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://averagerob.com">https://averagerob.com</a><br />instagram rob: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/averagerob">http://instagram.com/averagerob</a><br />instagram arno: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/arnothekid">http://instagram.com/arnothekid</a><br />edited by: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/milancools">https://www.instagram.com/milancools</a>{% endraw %}
