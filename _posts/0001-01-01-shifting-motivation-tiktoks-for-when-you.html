{% raw %}Hey, I know shifting is hard. I know it can be frustrating to be trying to shift for months and still wake up in your CR but hear me out: DON'T give up, TAKE A BREAK!<br /><br />Seriously. Take a break. An actual break like one or two months. Your DR isn't going anywhere, it will still be there the next time you try to shift. And by taking a break, you'll feel refreshed and have a better mindset when you go back to shifting again!<br />And, honestly tho, are you gonna give up on a lifetime of shifting just because you're not getting it NOW? Doesn't make a lot of sense to me tbh...<br /><br />But anyway, loves, go drink some water and relax, you got this! Just don't be too harsh on yourself ♡<br /><br />None of the tiktoks here are mine, I just compilated them! If your tiktok is here and you want it taken down, please let me know so that can be arranged!<br /><br />My TikTok acc: shifting_babie{% endraw %}
