{% raw %}Venture capitalist John Doerr, chairman at Kleiner Perkins, joins 'Squawk Box' to discuss his new book and the rise of electric vehicles.

That’s still far behind Tesla’s market cap of more than $1 trillion.<br /><br />GM’s market cap was $88.7 billion early afternoon Thursday while Ford’s was $78.1 billion.<br /><br />The valuation means Amazon’s 20% stake in the business is now worth about $21 billion and puts Ford’s 12% stake at more than $12 billion.<br /><br />The price is especially staggering given Rivian does not yet have an established business model and only expects to bring in up to $1 million in revenue for the third quarter. It said in its prospectus that it expects to lose up to $1.28 billion during that quarter.<br /><br />Rivian beat rivals to the market with a fully electric pickup but has yet to produce high volumes of its vehicles.<br /><br />Amazon plans to use Rivian vehicles in its delivery fleet, having ordered 100,000 to be handed over by 2030. It expects to have 10,000 Rivian vehicles delivering Amazon packages as early as next year.<br /><br />» Subscribe to CNBC TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic</a> <br /><br />Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.
