The Batsuit is one of the most crucial aspects of the whole character, and it is usually as deep, complex and awesome as the man who wears it. Over the years there have been many iterations of the suit, some of them have been great, some of them have been not so great, and some of them have had nipples...enough said. In each of these designs the suit has always turned out a little different, not just aesthetically, but what it can do and each suit often has some distinct and unique feature or power that others don’t possess. With the recent DC Fandome trailer showcasing Robert Pattinson’s Batsuit in much more detail and giving us a deeper insight into what this suit can do, we thought we’d take a look at hidden details and pieces of trivia in all of the live action adaptations of the iconic outfit.<br /><br />From secret powers and abilities that you might not know the suit possess, to call backs and easter eggs to Batman comics, other movies and Batman lore in general, hidden trademarks and logos that you might not have noticed, ways the suits influenced the actors who wore them, and just how that infamous Batsuit came to be and what it was modelled on. So then, let’s get in our Batmobile and speed down the streets of Gotham City and I have no idea where I’m going with this analogy...Anyway, let’s take a look at some Batsuits shall we?<br /><br />What did you make of this video?
