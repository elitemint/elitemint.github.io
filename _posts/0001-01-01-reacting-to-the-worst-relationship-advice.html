{% raw %}*ENCOURAGEMENT BELOW* But first, for $125 off across your first four Green Chef boxes, go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://greenchef.us/MASTERS125">https://greenchef.us/MASTERS125</a> and enter code MASTERS125 ! ðŸ¤—<br /><br />WELL HEY THERE! Honestly Tori and I have been in such a good mood lately and a lot of that is credited to beginning our move in process. It feels so good to have a space to help us be the people we want to be. Whether that is a new recording set up, or a cozy bed for devotionals. The reason I'm mentioned this is because I just want to encourage you to invest into things that will help you connect more with God and walk MORE into His calling on your life. Of course that doesn't mean go waste money on things, but consider the way you steward your finances and don't negate the impact an investment in yourself can make on God's kingdom. Whether that is a retreat to connect more with God, or new journals to spend more time in prayer and reflection or on food that is BETTER for you to help you function better. It is a GOOD thing to invest in the things that will help us connect better with God and better serve Him. I know that seems like a lot of weird advice but that is what I'm currently feeling lol. So there.<br /><br />Love yall,<br />Chad &amp; Tori<br />p.s.
