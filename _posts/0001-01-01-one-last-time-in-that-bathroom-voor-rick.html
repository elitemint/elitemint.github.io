{% raw %}Voor Rick en zijn oma:<br /><br />One Last Time in That Bathroom<br /><br />Kid with gun,<br />See them run, see the time run out,<br />See the leafs fall, see the people,<br />It's a cruel place, you leave behind,<br /><br />See the mirror, see the ink drop,<br />Out of the corner of your eye,<br />Now look further, what have you got?<br />Why in Heaven do you cry?<br /><br />Yeah see that mirror, watch the young girl,<br />See the water reflect the life,<br />Yeah, it's bitter, as the wind blows,<br />And you don't realize,<br /><br />Yeah see that mirror, see that ink drop,<br />And I'm using it to write,<br />Yeah it's perfect, and it's love,<br />We're bound to the ink black lines,<br />See the seed grow, see the sad row,<br />And it's ink black in the night,<br />But see the people, see them grow tall,<br />And stand brave, as you leave them behind,<br /><br />I know don't want to, we know you have to go,<br />Can't live forever, can't smile eternal,<br />But what have you got, the mirror don't?<br />Yeah, you said it, that's right,<br />We have got something to fight for,<br />Something to think of,<br />That's not life, it is love, it's the feeling,<br />It is the heart, and even when it stops,<br />And you lay down to sleep,<br />Your heart will stay to keep us safe,<br />All together bound to lines,<br />All together bound with love, and humming while we cry.<br /><br />You had to know what you leave behind,<br />As you wave us goodbye,<br />It's your love, it's your warmth, 'cause the heart has no clocks, it knows no time.<br /><br />You wear a new hat, and it is called death, can't take it, take it off,<br />It doesn't leave space, it is too heavy, but nothing is to heavy to love.{% endraw %}
