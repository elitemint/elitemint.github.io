{% raw %}Jonny visits new Bristol brewery Lost and Grounded, a brewery that had hype before they even brewed a beer. Avoiding the IPAs we're all obsessed with, they're taking inspiration from Belgium and Germany with a range of lagers and yeast-forward beers.<br /><br />It's a beautiful brewery, with beautiful beers and people...but DAMN is it loud in there.<br /><br />Check out our partners at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.beermerchants.com">http://www.beermerchants.com</a><br /><br />Twitter –        @beerchannel<br />Facebook –   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/thecraftbeerchannel">http://www.facebook.com/thecraftbeerchannel</a><br />Instagram –  @jonnygarrett @mrbradevans<br /><br />Remember to drink responsibly(ish) and not be that guy...{% endraw %}
