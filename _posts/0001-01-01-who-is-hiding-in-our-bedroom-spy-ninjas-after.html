{% raw %}After Chad Wild Clay made &quot;We UNLOCKED the Mystery Room! | Spy Ninjas&quot;, Vy Qwaint created &quot;I Got Tricked by Regina 100 Times in 24 Hours&quot;, Daniel Gizmo uploaded &quot;We Built Chad &amp; Vy Their Dream Room But... | Spy Ninjas&quot;, Chad and Vy finally have their own room! The problem is, Daniel and Melvin were the ones in charge of decorating and creating the room. Alas, Chad and Vy make the most of it and are excited to try out their first night in their new crib. Daniel, Melvin and Regina are excited about decorating for Christmas! While decorating the tree with DIY crafts, Regina vents to Melvin that she is having trouble with her boyfriend, and she wants to break up with him! Could she have someone else on her mind? She has been watching a lot of Raniel fan edits recently. Meanwhile, Chad and Vy are running into a lot of problems in their new room. The bunk beds are too small for Chad, they keep hearing creepy noises coming from the vent, and Melvin keeps stinking up the place with his farts! Regina decides to break up with her boyfriend, but in the process of doing so, he insults her and tells her she isn't good at singing. The Spy Ninjas cheer her up by singing a Christmas song when all of a sudden, a mysterious note drops from the vent!
