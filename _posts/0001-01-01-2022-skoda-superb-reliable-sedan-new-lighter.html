{% raw %}New, lighter 110-kW (150-PS) engine with lower CO2 emissions<br />› Choice of seven engines and ten engine/drive combinations for the upgraded ŠKODA SUPERB<br />› SUPERB SCOUT exclusively available with either of the most powerful engines, all-wheel drive and Rough-Road package<br /><br />The upgraded SUPERB sees a new generation of engines make its ŠKODA debut. The 2.0 TDI outputting 110 kW (150 PS) is the first diesel from the new, particularly dynamic, efficient and low emission EVO generation. There is a total of seven engines, ten different engine/drive combinations and three chassis variants to choose from. The most powerful diesel is available with all wheel drive as an option, whilst for the range-topping petrol version it comes as standard. The new ŠKODA SUPERB SCOUT is exclusively available with either of these two top-of-the-range engines and all-wheel drive.<br /><br />The new 2.0 TDI delivering 110 kW (150 PS) is the Czech brand’s first diesel from the new EVO generation of engines. In comparison to its predecessor, several aspects have been optimised, including the crankshaft assembly and the exhaust, turbo, fuel-injection and thermo-management systems. This results in a lower weight and fewer emissions as well as reduced fuel consumption. In the upgraded SUPERB, the 2.0 TDI producing 110 kW (150 PS) is available with either a 6-speed manual gearbox or a 7-speed DSG and fulfils the Euro 6d-TEMP emissions standard.{% endraw %}
