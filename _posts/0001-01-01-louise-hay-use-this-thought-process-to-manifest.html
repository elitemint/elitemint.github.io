{% raw %}Louise hay - Use This Thought Process to Manifest $50,000,000 Instantly <br /><br />#LouiseHay #Manifestation #Lawofattraction<br /><br />Louise Hay talks about the fact people lack the ability to forgive, they hold onto to grudges and thoughts of hate, while they don‚Äôt understand that the person who needs to be forgiven, is probably themselves going through the same pain, and surprisingly they themselves might be the only person to understand the same pain as you. Louise Hay says that this habit is because of the lack of self-love that they feel, it is due to this feeling that such emotions tend to rise up. So if a person fills themselves up with this emotion of happiness and love, those angry thoughts and reasons, might just go away.<br />Well I hope you guys enjoyed the video, and do make sure to share your thoughts with us in the comment section.<br /><br />üîà SPEAKER :  Louise Hay<br /><br />*CREDIT<br />You can find more of Louise Hay's work here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.louisehay.com">https://www.louisehay.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/louiselhay">https://www.facebook.com/louiselhay</a><br /><br />üõéÔ∏è For more inspiring and motivation videos please subscribe to our channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/c/JustMotivation">https://youtube.com/c/JustMotivation</a><br />And press the bell icon to get a notification, when the new video will be published.<br /><br />üëâFan of Louise Hay?
