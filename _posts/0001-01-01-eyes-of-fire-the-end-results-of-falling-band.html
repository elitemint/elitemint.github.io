{% raw %}Band: Eyes of Fire Title: The End Results of Falling Album: Ashes to Embers<br /><br /><br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br /><br /><br />Here I am left here holding this empty heart<br /><br />You reach inside and try to feel what's left of me<br /><br />I fall back to the sea and try to forget this dream<br /><br />I peel the skin that holds me here inside of you<br /><br />I fall back to the sea and all I have left is this black heart<br /><br />I can't feel these arms around me<br /><br />I can hear your voice inside me<br /><br />(Release me from this empty lie, I don't want to feel this anymore)<br /><br />(Let go from this cell, I never wanted to feel this again)<br /><br />I didn't ask for this. I didn't try for this. I never asked for this.<br /><br />I never wanted this inside me{% endraw %}
