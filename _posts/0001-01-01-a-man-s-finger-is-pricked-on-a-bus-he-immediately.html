{% raw %}The bus on the bridge came to a sudden stop. Sam lurched forward from the momentum, pricking his hand on a wire in the seat in front of him. Sam suddenly got a bad feeling. Immediately afterward, he felt the bridge shake. It seemed like something was about to happen and he began to feel uneasy. Right at that moment, the portion of the bridge in front of the bus suddenly began to crack. Scared, Sam quickly told his girlfriend Molly to get off the bus. The other people on the bus followed them off.<br /><br />Behind them, Peter saw his girlfriend Candice grab the guardrail on the side of the bridge. Before he had a chance to save her, Candice died falling into the water along with the guardrail. However, this wasn’t the time to mourn. Sam held onto Peter and ran toward the end of the bridge.{% endraw %}
