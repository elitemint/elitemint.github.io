{% raw %}Bryant Cook plays Gifts Storm in a Modern League on Magic: The Gathering Online! These matches were played on: 12/05/21<br /><br />Gifts Storm is a deck that is weak to Force of Negation, Endurance, and creature removal. Which has made Remand a pretty bad card over the years since our opponent has the ability to just recast the problematic cards. What is the potential fix?<br /><br />Just like we are in Legacy, we're looking at white for Silence as well as Prismatic Ending. Silence stops the aforementioned cards dead in their tracks while Prismatic Ending is just one of the most versatile and best removal spells ever printed. Speaking of Wish! That's a relatively new addition to Gifts Storm which opens up some deckbuilding space.<br /><br />Izzet Presents or Gifts Ungiven? Holiday Gifts (Storm) is back! But how has Gifts Storm aged? Do the new role players make up the difference?<br /><br />We hope you enjoy this video!
