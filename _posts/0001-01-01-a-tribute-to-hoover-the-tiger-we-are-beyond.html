{% raw %}We are beyond heartbroken to let everyone know that Dr. Justin has humanely euthanized our beloved 15-year-old tiger Hoover this morning. Hoover suffered from several bouts of cancer in the last year or so and recently had to have toes removed on his front paw due to aggressive squamous cell carcinoma. Dr. Justin sedated Hoover this morning as he had just developed a limp and to check on how his paw was doing.<br /><br />His necropsy showed the tumors in his paw had returned, and more had developed in just the past few weeks. His bones looked to be cancer-ridden as well. Tissues will be sent to the labs, but there is no doubt that cancer was ravaging our precious Hoover and nothing was going to reverse that downhill spiral.<br /><br />- Big Cat Rescue<br /><br />-------------------------------------------<br /><br />Love Animals and Nature?
