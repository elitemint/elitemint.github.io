{% raw %}More Info: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://msbtc.world/">https://msbtc.world/</a><br /><br />Michael Saylor:<br />Location: Miami<br />Date: Monday 29th November<br />Company: Microstrategy<br />Role: CEO<br /><br />In August 2020, MicroStrategy commenced with the bold defensive move to invest significant treasury assets in Bitcoin in response to inflationary pressures. Since then, MicroStrategy has strategically enhanced their holdings to become the largest corporate owner of Bitcoin and just last week announced an additional $414 million purchase. <br /><br />The strategy has been led by CEO Michael Saylor. As a developer of enterprise software, Saylor has long espoused digital transformation. Bitcoin is part of that process, digitising the last major building blocks of the analogue society: property, energy, and money.<br /><br />Whilst this first wave of corporate adoption is entrepreneurial in spirit, the advantages of corporate adoption are clear. Yet, despite a glut of Bitcoin miners maximising their Bitcoin hodling, MicroStrategy hasn't been followed by a wave of institutions following suit. Such inertia is predicated on a range of impediments that may fall away in the next few years.<br /><br />In this interview, I talk to Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy. We discuss the evolution of their Bitcoin strategy, technological disintermediation, and Bitcoin as a foundational societal technology. <br /><br />SPEAKERS:<br />Michael J.
