Some animals are cute and look like they could use some petting. But behind the adorable veils lies the animal’s true nature that might not be as adorable.<br />From pandas to kangaroos, check out these 10 cute animals that are not the angels they appear to be.<br />#10 Panda<br />Panda videos are probably some of the most popular in the space. Watching these giant fluff balls goof around is quite a thrilling experience. But things aren’t always rosy.<br />The 300-pound panda bear has an incredibly powerful bite that anyone who knows what’s good for them would avoid. Thankfully, though, pandas don't usually use this bite on people unless they feel seriously threatened.<br />A big part of this super-powerful bite has to do with the panda’s diet that’s made up almost entirely of bamboo. Cracking bamboo stems needs a little more power which the panda just happens to have.<br />The high dependence on a bamboo diet is just one of the main reasons the giant bears are on the brink of extinction. According to National Geographic, a panda would most likely starve if there aren’t at least two bamboo species in its surroundings which makes sense when you consider the animal’s feeding habits.<br />Pandas spend over 12 hours per day just eating but end up digesting just a fifth of their consumption. That's because the bamboo itself is not very nutritious so grabbing as much as possible helps keep the pandas on the healthy side.<br />That’s quite unfortunate considering the bamboo cover is dwindling by the day.<br />#9 Leopard Seal<br />Seal leopards or leopard seals are exactly like their feline namesake both in appearance and hunting prowess. Just like leopards, they have spotted skin but the background here is grey rather than the big cat’s golden.<br />They also have powerful jaws and long sharp teeth that they use to hunt other aquatic animals like squids, penguins, smaller seals, and fish. Again, just like leopards, they’re fierce and equally successful hunters in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters where they live.<br />That’s why you don’t want to be near any one of these seals even though they might look like harmless aquatic puppies. Aggression is the only principle they seem to live by and quite a few people have been unfortunate enough to experience their ugly side.<br />Leopard seals have been documented to chase, stalk, and harass people in and outside the water. In some cases also, they've been known to attack vessels which goes to show just how human presence pisses them off.<br />#8 Swan<br />Besides the long conspicuous necks, some swan species are also known for their temper issues, especially when you venture too close to their nests. Some like the mute swan will make a lot of noise in the face of intrusion as a warning to the perceived enemy to back off.<br />Failure to do so is usually followed by the swan attacking using their huge bills and bone spurs in their wings. For smaller swans, that's a bit tolerable. But for the big ones like the mute swan with a wingspan of slightly over 2 meters, it can be a nightmare.<br />That aside, aggression is more common towards other swans over things like food and shelter, so you should be okay if you can keep a safe distance. Not all species follow this rule, though.<br />Bewick’s swans, for instance, are known to show aggression to every animal species around them.<br />#7 Poison Dart Frogs<br />The name gives you an idea of what to expect from these deep Amazonian dwellers.<br />They feature a wide array of bright colors and patterns including black, copper, yellow, blue, gold, red, and green. While pleasing to look at, the colors are more than just beauty statements. If anything, they’re a stern warning for any would-be predators to stay away.<br />Turns out, any poison dart frog’s skin is parked with toxic substances enough to kill 10 grown men according to National Geographic, effectively making the frog one of the most toxic animals on the planet.<br />That being said, the level of toxicity will vary from one frog to another and the surroundings. The golden poison dart frog is by far the most toxic but the toxicity will be non-existent when the frog is raised in captivity.<br /> According to scientists, this could be an indication that the frogs don’t actually synthesize the poison but instead assimilate it from their insect diet.<br /><br />#6 Pufferfish<br />Pufferfish come in all kinds of beautiful patterns which make them easy to spot. On top of that, they’re also slow swimmers, so any would-be predator will have an easy time snacking on them under normal circumstances.{% endraw %}
