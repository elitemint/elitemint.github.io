{% raw %}Pyx Lax (Πυξ Λαξ, Pix Lax) was a Greek entechno-rock band. Originally formed in 1989, they released their first recording in 1990, and had a critical and commercial success in the Greek music industry for fifteen years, before being dissolved in 2004. They are considered as the most successful, commercially, group in the history of Greek discography with three gold and five platinum albums. Some of their greatest hits were: De Tha Dakryso Pia Gia Sena, Ti Ine Afto Pou Mas Enoni?, I Palies Agapes Pane Ston Paradeiso, Mia Synousia Mystiki, Epapses Agapi na thymizeis, Poula me, Monaxia mou ola.<br />Initially the members of the band were Filippos Pliatsikas, Babis Stokas, Sakis Stamoulis, and Panayiotis Spyropoulos. Their professional recording career began with a demo cassette which they delivered to Minos EMI in Athens. Marketing Director of Minos EMI at the time, Manos Xydous, liked their recordings so much, that he later joined the band. Another member of staff, Dimitris Fergadis, the head of Sales, proposed their name Pyx Lax.<br />During their career, Pyx lax have collaborated with many Greek singers and musicians such as George Dalaras, Haris Alexiou, Vasilis Papakonstantinou, Katsimihas Brothers, Lavrentis Machairitsas, Miltiadis Paschalidis, Vasilis Karras, Makis Christodoulopoulos, Sotiria Leonardou, Melina Tanagri, Psarantonis, Lakis Papadopoulos, Domenica, ONAR, Theodosia Tsatsou, Mihalis Tzouganakis, Ilias Makridis and many more.<br /><br />The biggest number of the band's international collaborations were included in their last studio album Charoumeni Stin Poli Ton Trelon (2003), with most notable songs: Someone Wrote ‘Save Me’ On a Wall (with Eric Burdon singing lead) and All My Angels Falling (with Marc Almond). In 1999 they had also released the cd-single Let The Picture Do The Talking (As' tin Ikona Na Milai) along with the Corsican group I Muvrini and Sting. Other important international artists that collaborated with Pyx Lax were: Gordon Gano, Steve Wynn, Bayaka and Saša Dragić.<br />In 2004 the band announced in a television interview that it would be dissolved after two goodbye concerts. The concerts were scheduled for 18 September in Athens and 20 September in Thessaloniki. Tickets for the Athens concert were sold out within a few hours, and a second concert was arranged for 19 September. Their final album, called simply Telos - Live Sto Likavitto (End - Live at Lycabetus) is a recording of the first goodbye concert in Lykavittos, Athens.<br />In 2010 Manos Xydous died at the age of 57. Before his death the members of Pyx Lax were in talks of a reunification for concerts during 2011. The reunification finally took place without Manos with a big tour around Greece. <br />-- The most significant moment was the massive concert of the July 13th 2011 at the Athens Olympic Stadium, with a crowd of more than 75,000 spectators. --<br />In their time, Pyx Lax were considered to be one of the most popular bands in Greece. Sotiria Malfa, a Greek critic wrote that &quot;The stamp of Pyx Lax on Greek music of the end of the 90s and the beginning of the 00s is something more than profound.&quot;<br /><br />The band has been recognized for both their longevity and the number of records they sold, as well as &quot;the unique feeling which was created between Pyx Lax and their beloved public.&quot;<br /><br />Track list:<br />1: Εισαγωγή 2: Μοναξιά Μου Όλα 3: Ένα Παιδί Περπατάει Με Τα Χέρια 4: Υπάρχουν Χρυσόψαρα Εδώ? 5: Εσύ Εκεί 6: Η Εικόνα Του Χειμώνα 7: Πούλα Με 8: Senor (Tales Of Yankee Power) 9: Τι Είναι Αυτό Που Μας Ενώνει 10: Φωτιά 11: Συνήθεια 12: Ένα Γέλιο Κρεμασμένο Στο Μπαλκόνι 13: Στην Πόλη Των Τρελών 14: Αν Θα Μπορούσα Τον Κόσμο Να Άλλαζα 15: Ποδήλατα Δίχως Φρένα 16: Να Με Θυμηθείς 17: Στα Καμίνια 18: Λένε Για Μένα 19: Οι Παλιές Αγάπες Πάνε Στον Παράδεισο 20: Μέλυδρον 21: Μιά Συνουσία Μυστική 22: Έπαψες Αγάπη Να Θυμίζεις 23: Δεν Θα Δακρύσω Πια Για Σένα 24: Πυξίδα<br /><br />-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -<br />Notes by deep46blue for Friends, Artists, Composers, Photographers, Videomakers:<br /> <br />✔ If you would like to submit your track, visual or any else art for promotion. <br />✔ If you want to add any kind of information which belongs to the video (audio or visual) <br />✔ If you have any issues regarding any of the videos. <br /><br />Please look for my email address in my channel's about page, I will be glad to read from you :)<br /><br />Follow Me On Facebook:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/deep46blue/">https://www.facebook.com/deep46blue/</a><br /><br />Follow Me On G+ (Google): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/101187408229560808531">https://plus.google.com/u/0/101187408229560808531</a><br /><br />✔Select the Optimal Resolution 4K-2160p or HD 1080p and the Full Screen Mode, to fully enjoy it !<br />✔ Be aware all music and pictures belongs to the original artists. <br />✔ I am in no position to give anyone permission to use this.{% endraw %}
