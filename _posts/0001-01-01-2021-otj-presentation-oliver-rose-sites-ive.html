{% raw %}In this presentation for the Online Teaching Japan 'Summer Sessions' on Aug 25 2021, I introduced 3 sites that I relied on heavily throughout the last year of teaching online, that are perhaps not widely known. I give a brief explanation and demonstration of how I use each site:<br /><br />1) www.LingoLab.Online (free, *this is my own site) - for setting self-study, quizzes &amp; live games with phrases &amp; sentences. <br /><br />2) www.GoFormative.com (freemium, very useful even at free tier) - for setting open-ended questions and monitoring live responses. <br /><br />3) www.Zengengo.com (subscription-based, free trial) - for easily setting customized accountable listening &amp; reading activities. <br />*I also showed in more detail how to make various text/audio/speech recognition activities with this site.{% endraw %}
