{% raw %}As a full time, influencer, and brand owner I have been quite absent from YouTube. I wanted to make this video to show you what goes on behind the scenes of it all. A lot of unexpected things can happen with these two jobs. <br />In this video, I will shine more light on how Fashion Weeks affected me, dealing with the loss of a friend, how I learned to become a better leader for my brand and why it is important to let the fear of something new go.<br /><br />Having great mental health does not mean that there will be an absence of troubles, no matter how great your life is. However, instead of dreading negatives feelings, we should strive to understand what we can learn from them, and why we perceive them as negative.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Instagram: [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/xeniaadonts/](https://www.instagram.com/xeniaadonts...)">https://www.instagram.com/xeniaadonts/](https://www.instagram.com/xeniaadonts...)</a><br /><br /> TikTok: [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@xeniaadonts?l...](https://www.tiktok.com/@xeniaadonts?l...)">https://www.tiktok.com/@xeniaadonts?l...](https://www.tiktok.com/@xeniaadonts?l...)</a> <br /><br />I launched a blog, where I talk about all things fashion!
