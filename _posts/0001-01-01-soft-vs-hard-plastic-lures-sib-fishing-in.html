{% raw %}Every angler swears by one lure, the one that catches them more and better fish than any other. I wanted to put some of my favourites to the test in a mini face off to see which would reign superior.<br /><br />As I left the shelter of the estuary I was greeted by howling winds and crashing waves, a site no angler wants as they embark on a day's fishing. I knew the sea handling capabilities of my 3.7m SIB would safely see me to more sheltered waters. It certainly wouldn't be a dry ride but quite a bit of fun skipping along the wave tops. The  shallows were teaming with school bass falling to all manors of shallow diving hard plastics, surface lures, jigs and paddle tails. The average stamp of fish was rather underwhelming for December a time when I don't expect to catch a lot but the chance of a donkey is always there. I did find a few better fish residing in the shallowest parts of the reef which really surprised me for the time of year... Then again sea temperature is slightly higher than usual for the area. The weather was certainly challenging and kept me on my toes all day but I was rewarded with fish and the joy of spending a day at sea.{% endraw %}
