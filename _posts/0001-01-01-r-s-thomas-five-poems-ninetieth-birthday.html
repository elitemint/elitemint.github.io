{% raw %}The first two poems see the bird-watching priest-poet paying a visit to elderly parishioners.  His dislike of the machine of course included cars and tractors but, it would appear from elsewhere, extended even as far as vacuum cleaners.  <br /><br />The third poem is a reflection on his life with Mildred Elsi Eldridge(!909-1981), an established artist at 25 who sold all she had on show in the 1936 Royal Academy Exhibition and ran a Bentley.   According to their son Gwydion she cooked four meals for her husband every day for 50 years and latterly painted in a miserable damp room with her feet in a cardboard box warmed by a small electric fire.  But, it would appear,she also managed to give her husband the occasional hard time.  Although having a curious compulsion to be exceptionally hard on himself Thomas was very sensitive to criticism from others.  <br /><br />The fourth poem is an account of a visit by someone who came to vent her anger in his presence.  My suspicion that she had not come to denounce another parishioner but was angry with something he had done arises from a sense that, far from being pleased with himself that he had managed to see this person off without even speaking to her, he recognises that he had, in some way,  failed her.  Perhaps this arises from his observation that a woman might have the capacity to offer a devastating personal critique while smiling all the while to let us know that she still cares about us in spite of the fact we are a total dead loss,  <br /><br />She came for deliverance and he sent her away with a stone.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The Visit<br /><br />She was small;<br />Composed in her way <br />Like music.  She sat<br />In the chair I had not <br />Offered, smiling at my left<br />Shoulder.  I waited on <br />For the sentences her smile<br />Sugared.<br />                That the tongue<br />Is a whip needed no<br />Proving.  And yet her eye<br />Fondled me.  It was clear<br />What anger brought her<br />To my door would not unleash<br />The coils.  Instead she began<br />Rehearsing for her<br />Departure. As though ashamed<br />Of a long stay, she rose,<br />Touched the tips of my cold<br />Hand with hers and turned<br />To the closed door.  I remember<br />Not opening it.{% endraw %}
