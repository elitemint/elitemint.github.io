{% raw %}An entire tour of my houseplant collection. This is a long video, so sit back and relax, or do some plant chores and listen to me talk about plants for an hour haha. It was nice filming this video because it gave me the opportunity to re appreciate my plants and fall back in love with them. It's amazing to see how my plants have grown and I like to imagine I'm growing along side them. Also, let me know which plant is your favorite in the comments, i'd love to what the community favorite is. Perhaps I'll give the winning plant a blue ribbon lol.<br /><br />Best,<br />Benji<br /><br />Timestamps<br />0:00 - entryway &amp; kitchen<br />21:37 - bathroom &amp; office<br />26:23 - bedroom<br />40:46 - balcony<br /><br />recommended plant products <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/benji_plant">https://www.amazon.com/shop/benji_plant</a><br /><br />SOCIAL MEDIA<br /><br />benjiplant.com - I made a website!<br />instagram  -  @benji_plant<br />tiktok - @benjiplant<br />business email - benjiplantcontact@gmail.com<br /><br />plant poster (made by me!): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/benjiplant">https://www.etsy.com/shop/benjiplant</a><br />plant poster hanger: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3hFGFlx">https://amzn.to/3hFGFlx</a><br /><br />MUSIC<br /><br />mostly provided by Epidemic Sound, here's my referral link for a free trial!
