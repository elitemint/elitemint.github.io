{% raw %}Bob's calling from a blocked number, so he's happy he finally gets ahold of Melissa who missed his call last time! They talk about exercising from the home with SweatDeck, what it's like being an out-of-work chef, and re-reading Dirty Daddy during quarantine. Later, Bob chats with Craig who has been sheltering-in-place since St. Patrick's Day and wants to know all about The Aristrocrats. Plus, Bob's final call is from Michaela, who informs Bob that she has a picture of him as her phone case!<br /><br />Listen to Bob Saget’s Here For You now: ​<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/BobSagetsHereForYouPod">https://bit.ly/BobSagetsHereForYouPod</a><br /><br />Listen Anywhere!<br />Apple Podcasts: ​<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/BobSagetsHereForYouApple">https://bit.ly/BobSagetsHereForYouApple</a> <br />Spotify: ​<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/BobSagetsHereForYouSpotify">https://bit.ly/BobSagetsHereForYouSpotify</a> <br />Stitcher: ​<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/BobSagetsHereForYouStitcher">https://bit.ly/BobSagetsHereForYouStitcher</a> <br />Google: ​<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/BobSagetsHereForYouGoogle">https://bit.ly/BobSagetsHereForYouGoogle</a><br /><br />Follo​w Bob Saget:<br />Official Website: ​<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bobsaget.com">https://bobsaget.com</a> <br />Facebook: ​<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/bobsaget">https://facebook.com/bobsaget</a> <br />Instagram: ​<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/bobsaget">https://instagram.com/bobsaget</a> <br />Twitter: ​<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/bobsaget">https://twitter.com/bobsaget</a><br />Snapchat: ​<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://snapchat.com/add/bobsterclaw">https://snapchat.com/add/bobsterclaw</a> <br />TikTok: ​<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tiktok.com/@bobsaget">https://tiktok.com/@bobsaget</a><br /><br />About the Podcast:<br />BOB SAGET’S HERE FOR YOU is a podcast that is like no other— Because it goes inside Bob’s Saget’s mind, and then quickly filters out through his mouth. Bob has a way of calming people with genuine empathy and humor while they’re going through a difficult time, which we all are at present. Reaching his unusually diverse audience that he talks to as a friend, Bob is the dad with great advice, the irreverent funny guy who’s always there when you need a laugh, and the free-associative Bob who goes off on crazy tangents then returns to the subject at hand, as serious or as comedic as it may be, to wrap up each episode in a way only Bob can do. Because he really does believe, “He’s here for you.&quot; <br /><br />#BobSaget #HereForYou #Podcast{% endraw %}
