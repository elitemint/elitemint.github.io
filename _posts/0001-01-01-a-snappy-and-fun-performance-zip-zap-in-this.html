{% raw %}In this fresh and playful performance, Zip Zap shares a series of fun skits -- and discusses the importance of youth education.<br />TEDArchive presents previously unpublished talks from TED conferences.<br />Enjoy this unedited talk by Zip Zap.<br />Filmed at TEDGlobal 2007.<br />NOTE: Comments are disabled on this video. We made this difficult decision for the TED Archive because we believe that a well-moderated conversation allows for better commentary from more people and more viewpoints. Studies show that aggressive and hateful comments silence other commenters and drive them away; unfortunately, YouTube's comment moderation tools are simply not up to the task of allowing us to monitor comments on so many videos at once. (We'd love to see this change, YouTube.) So for now, if you'd like to comment on this talk, please use Facebook, Twitter or G+  to discuss with your networks.{% endraw %}
