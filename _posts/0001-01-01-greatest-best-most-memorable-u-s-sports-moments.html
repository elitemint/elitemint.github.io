{% raw %}This is a video of the best american sports moments from the last decade including 10 different sports in 3 different levels: High School, College, and Professional. I made this video because I was watching the other video and thought that they were all missing something so I decided to make my own which I believe includes all of the best moments. <br /><br /><br />I do not own any of the videos.<br /><br /><br /><br />Songs:<br /><br />Alesso - Heroes<br /><br />The Script - Superheroes<br /><br />Wiz Khalifa - See you again<br /><br />Avicii - Wake Me Up <br /><br />Cold War Kids - First<br /><br />The Script - Hall of Fame<br /><br />Diddy-Dirty Money - I'm Coming Home<br /><br />Tinie Tempah ft. Eric Turner - Written in the Stars<br /><br />Post Malone ft. Ozzy Osbourne &amp; Travis Scott - Take What You Want{% endraw %}
