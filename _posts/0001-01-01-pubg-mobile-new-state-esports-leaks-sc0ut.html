{% raw %}The release of PUBG New State is edging closer, and the hype among the players continues to rise. Approximately two weeks from now, the game will be made available to users on both Android and iOS platforms across the globe.<br /><br />To ensure that PUBG New State is stable before it is made available, the developers have recently started a Technical Test for the game. It will be accessible for a brief period of time, and only those who previously took part in Alpha Test 2 will be able to get a crack at it.<br /><br />Some streams like @JONATHAN GAMING , @MortaL and @sc0ut and many others get the early access of game and they also share their opinion on @PUBG: NEW STATE  .<br /><br />There are currently four playable options in the technical test - Troi, Erangel 2051, Station (4v4 TDM), and Training Ground (Training Mode).<br /><br />Green Flare Gun: Flare Guns are traditionally used to call airdrops in PUBG, but in PUBG New State, a new type - the Green Flare Gun - has been introduced. The new type of flare gun will allow gamers to revive a teammate who died during the period of the match.<br /><br />Recruit System: This will be one of the most unique game features, and players will be able to recruit an opponent after killing them. Doing so will only be possible if there is space available in their team<br /><br />Erangel 2051: Erangel is one of the playable maps in PUBG New State, as mentioned above. Buildings on the map and a great deal of other content will be destroyed in the year 2051.<br /><br />PUBG New State employs global illumination technology to provide players with the best graphics possible on the mobile platform. With great map textures that are incredibly detailed, the visuals offered by the game are genuinely remarkable.<br /><br />In response to a question during a recent media showcase, New State’s creative director Daehoon Kim said that there aren’t any immediate plans for esports.<br />“Instead of focusing on esports, the development team’s top priority is in doing everything possible to provide stable game service,” said Daehoon Kim .<br /><br />This doesn’t mean that esports isn’t the roadmap for PUBG: New State, though. The creative director added that there has been a lot of interest from regional partners regarding a competitive scene for New State. After the game has been launched and stabilized, Krafton will be bringing in small-scale esports events and move up from there.<br /><br />Even though esports isn’t in the immediate plans, Krafton has confirmed that special online competitions will take place in the game. PUBG: New State will feature an eight-level tier system with seasons lasting two months. At the end of each season, the players in the top three tiers will be able to participate in some tournaments for “big rewards.”<br /><br />It isn’t surprising to see Krafton commit to expanding the game’s playerbase first before conducting esports competitions. <br /><br /><br />My second channel - <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCewBZNMJOn7bnhFsHH4CShA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCewBZNMJOn7bnhFsHH4CShA</a><br /><br />Sponsored By - <br />Extra0rdinnary is sponsored by GemWire - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gemwire.gg/">https://www.instagram.com/gemwire.gg/</a><br /><br />BECOME CHANNEL MEMBERS - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJLFsRmpJtYMvEjoxgl0fEw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJLFsRmpJtYMvEjoxgl0fEw/join</a><br /><br />Contact And Follow me on -   <br /><br />Follow me on Instagram  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/extra_0rdinnary/">https://www.instagram.com/extra_0rdinnary/</a><br />Follow me on Facebook  - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Extraordinary997">https://www.facebook.com/Extraordinary997</a><br />Follow me on Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/EoOfficial99">https://twitter.com/EoOfficial99</a><br />My DISCORD - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/X8fFZYg">https://discord.gg/X8fFZYg</a><br />You Can Send Me News on Instagram. <br /><br />About My channel -<br /><br />Extra0rdinnary is an esports and gaming news platform that puts a focus on pro players, teams, creators, and the games that make it all possible. <br /><br />DISCLAIMER -<br />If you need a song removed on my channel, please message me on Instagram . <br />© Copyright: We / I do not own any of the material in this video.<br />I upload videos for promotional and preview purposes only!<br />If you are the Producer or Photographer and would like the Video taken down please Email me and we / I shall remove it immediately.<br />Please do not issue a &quot;Copyright Strike&quot; against the Channel as it affects all previous work.
