{% raw %}My last video was a detailed review on the brand Enliven. We spoke about whether its CG FRIENDLY and what I thought about each product. We also broke down the ingredients.<br /><br />I generally take at least a month to test products and then give you my thoughts &amp; opinions. I never try a full line together. I generally introduce products one by one into my routine and see how my results change. <br />This way, I am able to gain a better perspective on each product. <br /><br />I did this demo + review because many of you requested for it. It is a budget friendly brand. One of the more affordable options here in India. <br />I therefore made an exception this once.<br /><br />Since the line is not completely CG friendly, I will not be able to test them out at length. I used all the products together. This is my first impression on the products.<br />(I have used the mousse and gel several times on my channel) <br />This is the first &amp; only time I have tried both the shampoo &amp; conditioner. <br /><br />After this, I will go back to using only CG friendly products. Silicones will not feature in my routine hence forth. <br /><br />What did you guys think? I feel like my hair lacked its usual shine and gloss. Did you notice a difference?<br /><br />I lost most of my styling footage: <br />Please have a look at my regular styling routine here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/AL0bF0er93I">https://youtu.be/AL0bF0er93I</a><br /><br />WATCH MY PREVIOUS VIDEO REVIEWING THESE PRODUCTS AT LENGTH:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ah_a0m4Ba4E">https://youtu.be/ah_a0m4Ba4E</a><br /><br />CAN YOU USE REGULAR CONDITIONER AS LEAVE IN CONDITIONER:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/FTqHrsDPVBc">https://youtu.be/FTqHrsDPVBc</a><br />__<br /><br />DISCOUNT CODES &amp; RECOMMENDATIONS:<br /><br />Amazon Storefront:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.in/shop/michellemanuel">https://www.amazon.in/shop/michellemanuel</a><br /><br />Northwish Naturals: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.northwishnaturals.com/shop-all">https://www.northwishnaturals.com/shop-all</a><br />CODE MICHELLE20<br /><br />Just Herbs Code: Michelle15<br /><br />Instagram Store @curlyn.in Code: Michelle5<br />(Curly Hair accessories like Tangle Teasers, Satin Bonnets &amp; Bows, Satin Pillowcases, Pineapple Keepers,<br />Microwaveable Heat Caps, Satin Scrunchies etc)<br /><br />__<br /><br />VIDEOS YOU MIGHT LIKE<br /><br />WAVY/CURLY HAIR JOURNEY<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/7g4zmii5Mzc">https://youtu.be/7g4zmii5Mzc</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/yyZUKBT4XVY">https://youtu.be/yyZUKBT4XVY</a><br /><br />HOW TO PLOP AND AIR DRY CURLY HAIR<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/np8a5wpf8oU">https://youtu.be/np8a5wpf8oU</a><br /> <br />Video on Proteins for Curly Hair<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/__u6DIy8I-Y">https://youtu.be/__u6DIy8I-Y</a><br /><br />Video On Humectants<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/PXyTyBfXCAg">https://youtu.be/PXyTyBfXCAg</a><br /><br />Busting 5 Hair Myths <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/rNVAryqTf60">https://youtu.be/rNVAryqTf60</a><br /><br />Pin Curl Refresh | Clump Training<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/3X_AEqC2bVY">https://youtu.be/3X_AEqC2bVY</a><br /><br />Triple Unicorn Curly Haircut<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/slylPmjOjUc">https://youtu.be/slylPmjOjUc</a><br /><br />Hair Porosity <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/o_To-zRwXFI">https://youtu.be/o_To-zRwXFI</a><br /><br />___<br /><br />MY OTHER SOCIALS:<br />INSTAGRAM:  @curlygirlmichelle<br />FOR BUSINESS ENQUIRIES: michelle.m.manuel@gmail.com<br /><br />___<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: Everything I state in my videos are merely my opinions, suggestions and recommendations.

It is quite possible for you to dislike a product that I love.<br />It's quite possible for you to be allergic to the products I use in my videos. <br />I only use cruelty free makeup/products therefore the eyeshadow pigments will sometimes contain dyes.

I've listed some common allergens found in shampoos in my pinned comments on a video called, 'ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS ON HAIR FALL'  You can find that video here. <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Zfoi6RO5dsg">https://youtu.be/Zfoi6RO5dsg</a><br /><br />Please be aware that all products do not suit everyone.
