{% raw %}The brain is the most powerful organ in the human body, and yet, many of us feel like we are ruled by our brains instead of having mastery over it. Dr. Roddy Carter, a personal physician turned executive coach, shares five principles for personal mastery to help harness the power of our brains to work for us.<br /><br />The human brain is what distinguish us from all other mammals, and it has tremendous power that we can learn to control. You’ll hear what personal mastery is, and will get 5 principles to live by in order to make real changes in our lives. Plus, you’ll hear two actions you can start TODAY to put you on a path to happiness.<br /><br />In the comments, we’d love to hear the three things about yourself that you are most proud of. <br /><br />----<br />ABOUT DR. RODDY CARTER<br /> <br />After his origins as a much-loved family physician, Roddy specialized in Exercise Science and Sports Medicine, preparing elite international athletes for Olympic competition. He went on to become a senior executive in a multi billion dollar biotech companies, improving the health of millions of patients around the globe. One day, he suddenly realized that in putting everyone else first, he’d risked a catastrophic personal crisis.<br />Just in time, Roddy rebooted his own life, restoring youth, happiness, and purpose. He now dedicates his insight and experience to helping others transform their lives, reclaiming the energy, focus, and self-confidence they deserve. If you meet him, he will convince you that “health and happiness is your birthright - the biology of success is hard-wired into each of us.”<br />His mission: to activate hard working men and women to be their best by honoring their natural design.<br />In a few short years, Roddy has uplifted the personal and professional lives of over 50,000 hard-working men and women. In 2016, the San Diego Business Journal honored him with an Award of Distinction for “unlocking the treasure chests of the natural and social sciences to teach personal mastery and natural leadership.” Roddy considers his clients’ transformations to be his greatest accolades and quotes a prominent artist who praised him saying, “Thank you for introducing me to the woman I am meant to be.”<br /><br />Roddy Carter website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://roddycarter.com">https://roddycarter.com</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/drroddycarter">https://www.facebook.com/drroddycarter</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bodywhealth/">https://www.instagram.com/bodywhealth/</a><br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_CbF4Ryy1YuRqQQAHBiedg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_CbF4Ryy1YuRqQQAHBiedg</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/drroddycarter">https://twitter.com/drroddycarter</a> <br />----<br />RESOURCES<br /><br />Roddy Carter website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://roddycarter.com/">https://roddycarter.com/</a><br /><br />BodyWHeath website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bodywhealth.org/">https://www.bodywhealth.org/</a> <br /><br />BodyWHealth Book: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bodywhealth.org/product/bodywhealth-journey-abundance-ebook/">https://www.bodywhealth.org/product/bodywhealth-journey-abundance-ebook/</a><br />----<br />ABOUT HAPPINESS ADVENTURE<br /><br />Happiness Adventure is a one-stop, online destination for positive, inspiring learning covering a diverse range of topics.
