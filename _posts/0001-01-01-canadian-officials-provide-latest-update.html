{% raw %}Canadian health officials are expected to provide an update Friday on the country's ongoing COVID-19 situation and vaccine rollout.<br /><br />The update follows the announcement that federal public servants who have a valid medical or religious reason not to get the COVID-19 vaccine will be able to use rapid antigen tests as an alternative. <br /><br />However, those tests currently “aren’t accepted” for passengers on domestic planes or trains who have a medical exemption from getting their vaccine.<br /><br />A spokesperson for Health Canada confirmed the authorization comes as the federal government is preparing to deliver rapid antigen tests to organizations or departments that fall under the mandate so they can accommodate employees who are unable to get the vaccine.<br /><br />Canada's update also comes after an expert panel on Tuesday voted overwhelmingly to recommend the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorize Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 to 11, saying the benefits of inoculation outweigh the risks.<br /><br />For more info, please go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8329393/canada-covid-vaccine-to-board-plane-or-train/">https://globalnews.ca/news/8329393/canada-covid-vaccine-to-board-plane-or-train/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Global News Channel HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/20fcXDc">http://bit.ly/20fcXDc</a><br />Like Global News on Facebook HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/255GMJQ">http://bit.ly/255GMJQ</a><br />Follow Global News on Twitter HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt">http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt</a><br />Follow Global News on Instagram HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB">https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB</a><br />#GlobalNews #COVID19 #coronavirus #cdnpoli #Canada{% endraw %}
