margins and we ask him what what do you think about it what do you mean what i think about this what what is your question this is a report that was given to you addressed to your name and these are<br /><br />these are your annotations in on the margins and and we claim that this was writ what this is your handwriting yes listen<br /><br />i was asked this kind of question before and i said if anything appears or seems to be my handwriting and my handwriting is known is is is very much known uh among all iraqis and you can determine that if it is my handwriting or not and i said if anyone from the revolutionary council says saddam hussein was the only one and he acted on his own and i will not rebuke that except if it is if the action is against the reputation and the principles and values of saddam hussein only then i would deny it but i say more any iraqi says that saddam hussein<br /><br />is guilty of anything that will discharge that particular iraqi i will accept that responsibility if it helps any iraqi from the north from the south from the center i will not rebuke i will not deny any responsibility except when it's against my reputation or my principles so let me say it again if anything we don't know yet if how far forging the forging art has reached in the world and our in our country too<br /><br />any comment any signature is proven to be of saddam
