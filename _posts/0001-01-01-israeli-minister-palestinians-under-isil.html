{% raw %}United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and the Israeli government are at odds after the UN chief criticised the Israeli occupation in an address to the Security Council last week. <br /><br />Ban said it was &quot;human nature&quot; for Palestinians to react to the occupation, specifically pointing to settlement building as a &quot;provocative&quot; action. The remarks elicited strong criticism from the Israeli government, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accusing the UN chief of &quot;encouraging terror&quot;. <br /><br />In this week's Headliner, Mehdi Hasan speaks to Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely, the country's top diplomat, about Ban's remarks. <br /><br />Hotovely says Israel's domestic and military intelligence agencies are &quot;absolutely wrong&quot; to suggest that Palestinian violence is created from hopelessness. <br /><br />&quot;It means that terrorism is the main problem, is the main issue, not frustration,&quot; the de-facto foreign minister adds. <br /><br />Hotovely also suggests Palestinians may have been influenced by the rise of ISIL. &quot;There are many other people that are saying that the Palestinian society today is choosingâ€¦the extremist side, under the influence of ISIS, as the atmosphere of the way the youngsters are being raised,&quot; she says, &quot;and unfortunately also when theyâ€™re raised under the very hard incitement of the Palestinian Authority.&quot;<br /><br />- Subscribe to our channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe">http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe</a><br />- Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/AJEnglish">https://twitter.com/AJEnglish</a><br />- Find us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera">https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera</a><br />- Check our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/">http://www.aljazeera.com/</a>{% endraw %}
