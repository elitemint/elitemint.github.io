{% raw %}Watch our Parker webinar on extreme temperature resistance specifically with the elastomers to see how our materials can assist in your critical applications. When we look at our offerings and what kind of benchmarks have been established for the industry, specifically with FKM and FFKM technologies, these gray boxes represent where the technology has been sitting both on the high temperature range and low temperature range for many years. <br />Parker O-Ring &amp; Engineered Seals Division has been really pushing the limits on each of these metrics and trying to expand the temperature of our materials. The first thing we're going to start off with is how we're pushing it with high temperature FKMs, specifically with our VA179 material. This is a material that's been designed for high temperature engine applications, any type of dry air, high temperature. It has the opportunity to really bridge the gap between where FKM have kind of a drop-off after 400 degrees Fahrenheit and bridge that gap again, between those and the FFKMs, which typically have about a 500, five 25 Fahrenheit range. So this material, as you can see, is good in continuous temperatures up to about 440 degrees. <br /><br />For more information on VA179, click here:h <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="ttp://www.parkerorings.com">ttp://www.parkerorings.com</a> <br /><br />#ExtremeTemperature #Orings #Sealing #Elastomers{% endraw %}
