{% raw %}&quot;Behind the Scenes&quot; clip from Episode 037, which is the multiplier that gives us the &quot;triplicities&quot;:  <br /> 3 x 37 = 111 and 6 x 37 - 222 and 9 x 37 = 333 etc.<br />Systems of Kabbalah include number values that correspond to the letters of the alphabet, which can add a layer of mathematical meaning to words and phrases, names, etc...<br /><br />This clip was made available to Patreon contributors more than four months ago.
