{% raw %}in between filming and editing i got so scared one of my arguments was bad that i watched 46 episodes of HIMYM in an 18-hour span. edit: Hey all, just a heads up, there was an issue with -upload audio being lower than intended so you might have to turn up your volume a bit. I'll make sure to double check this for all future videos!<br /><br /><br /><br />notes: Hey look I made a &quot;real thumbnail&quot;! I really enjoyed making this video, but in the back of my mind I still have the (potentially very real) fear that one of my judgements was unfair or flat-out wrong. I hope you like it even if you don't fully agree{% endraw %}
