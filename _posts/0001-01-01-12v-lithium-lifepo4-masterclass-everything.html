{% raw %}Sit back, relax and get ready to find out everything you need to know about Lithium Ion and Lithium Iron Phosphate LiFePO4 12V batteries with our resident 12V expert Cahn. Lithium batteries offer a couple of huge benefits over typical lead acid batteries including the fact that they’re super lightweight, they have a high energy density (lots of power in a small package) and they have a much longer cycle life.<br /><br />In this video we cover the difference between different types of Lithium Ion and Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries, the difference between LiFePO4 and AGM batteries, how Lithium batteries ‘work’ and how to get the most out of them including charging and storage tips. Finally we cover what to look for when doing your own research and focus on how important it is to get a battery with a high quality Battery Management System or BMS.<br /><br /> <br />If you’re keen to update to a LiFePO4 setup in your vehicle, make sure you check out the Adventure Kings 120Ah Lithium Battery: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2YcWomo">https://bit.ly/2YcWomo</a> and the Adventure Kings 200Ah Lithium Battery: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3q33iWO">https://bit.ly/3q33iWO</a><br /><br />To check out the full range of Adventure Kings Lithium and AGM batteries click here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3q5j4QY">https://bit.ly/3q5j4QY</a><br /> <br />Make sure your Lithium Battery is being charged properly with a Kings Lithium Compatible DC-DC charger: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3wmgt6A">https://bit.ly/3wmgt6A</a><br /><br />-----------------------------<br /><br />Thanks for watching from all the team here at 4WD Supacentre.
