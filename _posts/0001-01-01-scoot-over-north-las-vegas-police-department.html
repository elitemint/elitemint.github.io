{% raw %}Featuring: <br />North Las Vegas Police Department<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.cityofnorthlasvegas.com/departments/police/">http://www.cityofnorthlasvegas.com/departments/police/</a><br /><br />Officers Adam Rosenthal and Tim Frabbiele of the North Las Vegas Police Department spot a man riding an unregistered scooter. They stop the nervous man who claims he found the scooter. He explains further that it had a free sign on it and wasn’t operable and didn’t have a key but he was able to get it back on the road and never questioned why it was free. He also tells the officers he’s run the VIN online several times and it isn’t stolen. Rosenthal checks the man’s pockets and finds a “tooter” which is an improvised smoking device for illegal substances. The man groans and explains a visitor left the pipe in his home and he picked it up to give it back and it is ‘not his’. The officers ask why he wouldn’t have thrown it away immediately, and explain it's in his possession and they could charge him with it. He goes on to say his girlfriend has a problem with drug use and he has been clean for a while and is trying to stay that way for the sake of his children. Rosenthal tells the man his troubles just got more serious, as the scooter comes back stolen from 2017. While the officers decide to not charge him with possession of the paraphernalia, they have no choice but to charge him with possession of the stolen vehicle. When the 37-year-old man breaks down and exclaims he has wasted his life, Rosenthal has a heart-to-heart with the tearful man, telling him he still has time to change his life and he’s on the right path to doing so. <br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/copstv/">http://www.facebook.com/copstv/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/copstv/">http://www.instagram.com/copstv/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/CopsTV">http://www.twitter.com/CopsTV</a>{% endraw %}
