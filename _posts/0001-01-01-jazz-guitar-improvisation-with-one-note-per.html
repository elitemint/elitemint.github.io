And there are some people who play slowly and don’t use a lot of notes, but who play very melodic, interesting and inspiring solos.<br /><br />The truth is that you can play beautiful solos with only ONE note for each chord. You just need to use some of the creative elements that I’ll be sharing with you in this lesson.<br /><br />When you can play creative and melodic solos with ONE note per chord, you're more likely to play beautifully when adding more elements. Because the less you think about WHAT to play, the more room you have to think about how to be creative.<br /><br />In this lesson, I demonstrate over the Minor Blues chord progression, but you can implement this idea with any song.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br />© GypsyAndJazz.com<br />🎸 Teaching you jazz guitar through the legacy of Django Reinhardt is my mission!<br /><br />👉🏼 Check out my online school website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gypsyandjazz.com/">https://www.gypsyandjazz.com/</a><br /><br />👉🏼 Free lessons in the style of Django Reinhardt (gypsy jazz):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gypsyandjazz.com/the-blog/">https://www.gypsyandjazz.com/the-blog/</a><br /><br />👉🏼 Get your free arpeggio e-Book:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/freearpeggios">http://bit.ly/freearpeggios</a><br /><br />#GypsyAndJazz #DjangoReinhardt #FreeOnlineJazzGuitarLessons{% endraw %}
