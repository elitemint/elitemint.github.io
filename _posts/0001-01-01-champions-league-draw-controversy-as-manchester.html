Teams that have faced each other in the group stage are not permitted to face one another in the last-16, and there was much dismay when Arshavin plucked United out of the pot after Marchetti had picked out Villarreal.<br /><br />'No, this is not possible because Manchester United was in the group so we need to draw another one,' Marchetti said.
