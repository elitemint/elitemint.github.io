{% raw %}IIt was very windy and wavy, and the fish were no longer so careful. I had a lot of Seabass attacks smaller and bigger, but in the end the lure was swallowed by a nice 1.5kg seabass. A great lure like Duo bay ruf manic 95 is great for windy and calm weather. When it is windy or rainy then we can catch seabass during the day or usually most often at night. Enjoy the video.{% endraw %}
