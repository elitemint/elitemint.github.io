{% raw %}Soviet and US tank forces clash over the village of Schweben!<br /><br />This is the Combat Mission: Cold War base game, set in Fulda Gap between 1979 and 1982. Mods-wise I'm running the ubiquitous HQS sound mod and Vin's Geometric icons.<br /><br />Combat Mission is a game developed by Battlefront.com. One of the most realistic tactical simulations ever made, Combat Mission covers a wide variety of military settings, from World War 2 (Normandy, Market Garden, Sicily, Italy and the Eastern Front) to fictional modern conflicts in Syria (Shock Force) and Ukraine (Black Sea).
