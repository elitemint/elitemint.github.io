BREWER<br />Dr. Brewer started as an Emergency Doctor. After seeing too many preventable heart attacks, he went to Johns Hopkins to learn Preventive Medicine. While there, he went on the run the post-graduate training program (residency) in Preventive Medicine. From there, he made a career of practicing and managing preventive medicine and primary care clinics. His later role in this area was Chief Medical Officer for Premise, which has close to 1,000 primary care/prevention clinics. He was also the Chief Medical Officer for MDLIVE, the second largest telemedicine company. More recently, he founded PrevMed, a heart attack, and stroke prevention clinic.<br /><br />At PrevMed, we focus on heart attack, stroke, and cognitive decline. We serve patients who have already experienced an event as well as those who have not developed a diagnosis or event. Dr. Brewer provides services via telemedicine. We find a lot of undiagnosed prediabetes or insulin resistance. Treating unrecognized risk factors like prediabetes allows reduction of risk and prevention of disease.<br /><br />If you are interested in becoming a patient, please visit our website:<br />🧬<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://prevmedhealth.com">https://prevmedhealth.com</a><br /><br />Social<br />🎧Podcasts:<br />Simplecast <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://prevmed.simplecast.com/episodes">https://prevmed.simplecast.com/episodes</a><br />Apple Podcasts <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/prevmed/id1566825364">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/prevmed/id1566825364</a><br />Google Podcasts <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://care.prevmedheartrisk.com/google-podcast">https://care.prevmedheartrisk.com/google-podcast</a><br />Spotify <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/45Grdk47Ka9KtF33N31gNx">https://open.spotify.com/show/45Grdk47Ka9KtF33N31gNx</a><br />Amazon <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://care.prevmedheartrisk.com/amazon-podcast">https://care.prevmedheartrisk.com/amazon-podcast</a> <br /><br />☎️ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://prevmedhealth.com/contact-us/">https://prevmedhealth.com/contact-us/</a><br />👨🏼‍⚕️Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/PrevMedFB">https://bit.ly/PrevMedFB</a><br />📸Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/fordbrewermd/">https://www.instagram.com/fordbrewermd/</a><br />🐦Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/PrevMedDocFordTwitter">https://bit.ly/PrevMedDocFordTwitter</a><br />🧬LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/PrevMedLinkedIn">https://bit.ly/PrevMedLinkedIn</a><br />💊Supplements/Health Shop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/PrevMedStore">http://bit.ly/PrevMedStore</a><br />--<br />Get a High-Quality CIMT in a city near you!
