{% raw %}Welcome to the next generation of superyachting.<br /><br />For REBECA, the first of the innovative Benetti Oasis 40m series, designers RWD erased all their preconceptions, took a clean sheet of paper and, with a more youthful family clientele in mind, started from scratch.<br /><br />The result is a yacht that celebrates both life on the water and time outside in the invigorating ocean air, a blend of Italian elegance and British understatement packed with subtle design features that create a different experience.<br /><br />After yoga on the main deck, the day begins at the sky lounge breakfast bar on the upper deck. You can plan another amazing day with the captain as you sip on smoothies and choose your favourites pastries. After breakfast, the crew have the watertoys ready to go and it's time for some adrenaline on the water.<br /><br />The beach terrace is huge with unique fold-out wings either side that push the boundaries of space potential on a 40m yacht. The inviting glass infinity pool is almost at sea level, creating the illusion of sea bathing with the reality just a few steps away. There are toys aplenty and the deck crew will help you get the most out of every one of them. For a more sedate ocean experience, a hydraulic bathing platform makes the water safely accessible for all.<br /><br />Having worked up an appetite, it's time for lunch on the sun deck. It's always a family favourite and this one has been designed to deliver at every level. From the large raised jacuzzi forward that keeps bathers' eyeline at the same level as guests at the shaded dining table, to the BBQ, bar and ice machine that keep everyone satisfied. It's your personal paradise.<br /><br />After lunch the captain guides the yacht to the next anchorage and you can feel the wind in your hair in the foredeck lounge or stretched out on the sun pads. Arrive just in time for sundowners on the sun deck then head down to the lounge on the upper deck aft to take in the harbour lights twinkling on the water before heading down to the main deck dining room where the chef has a memorable gastronomic treat.<br /><br />After dinner, head up to the sky lounge to enjoy movies, sports or videos of the day's fun. Then it's time for bed, in the full beam main deck master suite or in three sumptuous double cabins and one twin cabin on the lower deck, where you can anticipate another amazing day.<br /><br />Forget everything you know about yachting holidays. REBECA is ready to change your perspective.<br /><br />Built<br />2020, Benetti, Italy<br /><br />Length<br />40.8m (133.8ft)<br /><br />Guests<br />10/11 in 5 cabins<br /><br />Key features<br />- Extensive beach club with infinity pool and fold-down side terraces<br />- Gym on the main deck<br />- Spacious sun deck with jacuzzi, sunpads, dining and BBQ<br />- Ultra-modern and guest friendly wheelhouse with panoramic views<br />- Zero speed stabilisers to reduce any rolling motion both at anchor and underway<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.burgessyachts.com/en/charter-a-yacht/yachts-for-charter/rebeca-10000017">https://www.burgessyachts.com/en/charter-a-yacht/yachts-for-charter/rebeca-10000017</a>{% endraw %}
