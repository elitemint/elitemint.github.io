{% raw %}If you have the coin, it's hard to deny this one's impressive: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shrsl.com/380fy">https://shrsl.com/380fy</a> 18V: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3BL83Xn">https://amzn.to/3BL83Xn</a> Find this tool on our T-shirts! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://torque-test-channel.preview.teespring.com/listing/team-teal-bolt-expectations?product=2">https://torque-test-channel.preview.teespring.com/listing/team-teal-bolt-expectations?product=2</a> Today we test an all new cordless mid torque, and by the looks and specs of it, it should be the most powerful cordless mid-torque impact wrench on the planet. Makita's new 1/2&quot; brushless XGT GWT07Z is boating numbers like 810 in a field of tools most often known for 400-500. Can it bring the bings to make up for its spicy $349 price tag? We find out. <br />Torque of TTC is working for Astro Tools who also make impact wrenches (air). TTC is not the only testing out there, always consider multiple sources when looking at a tool!<br />If you purchase anything from our Teestore or amazon store (that only includes winners): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3rjhZ6P">https://amzn.to/3rjhZ6P</a> and FWD your our order email to Torquerank@gmai.com, you'll get a link to all our or rank lists!{% endraw %}
