{% raw %}You already know the phrase... #NedRig4Life<br /><br />I have made numerous videos on Ned Rig retrieve techniques &amp; tips but this one is a bit different. On this fall fishing trip, I was planning to power fish with larger gear but ended up stumbling on this pattern (which I have done several times). Let the Ned Rig settle into the vegetation a bit, rip it out, and pause... BAM - the bass can't resist when you rip it out and pause it, especially in the fall with a baitfish imitating Ned Rig.<br /><br />Mule Jigs: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mulefishing.com/">https://www.mulefishing.com/</a><br />Ned Rig Baits: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discounttackle.com/collections/ned-rig?aff=6">https://discounttackle.com/collections/ned-rig?aff=6</a><br />Line: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discounttackle.com/products/sunline-xplasma-asegai-green-braided-line-165-yards?_pos=2&amp;_sid=3e0af9b70&amp;_ss=r&amp;aff=6">https://discounttackle.com/products/sunline-xplasma-asegai-green-braided-line-165-yards?_pos=2&amp;_sid=3e0af9b70&amp;_ss=r&amp;aff=6</a><br />Leader Line: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discounttackle.com/products/sunline-super-fluorocarbon-200-yards?_pos=1&amp;_sid=b0850028f&amp;_ss=r&amp;aff=6">https://discounttackle.com/products/sunline-super-fluorocarbon-200-yards?_pos=1&amp;_sid=b0850028f&amp;_ss=r&amp;aff=6</a><br /><br />More Ned Rig Tips: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYoBbwPfrs5aGIIV7cMZVdqIHJo5Jvgps">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYoBbwPfrs5aGIIV7cMZVdqIHJo5Jvgps</a><br /><br />Does Color Matter For The NED RIG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/g-g29H2FHM8">https://youtu.be/g-g29H2FHM8</a><br /><br />Thank you very much for watching.
