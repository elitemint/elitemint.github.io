{% raw %}Will Canada Again Opt For European #FighterJets Over American Warplanes? - Canada is searching for a new fighter plane to replace its aging fleet of CF-18s as part of its air force modernization program. The fact that the Swedish #Gripen-E made it to the final cut surprised everyone. It’s a huge turn of events, especially after Boeing was told it didn’t make it into the final phase. Now only one American fighter jet, the Lockheed Martin F 35, is left in the race.  @FORCE Technology{% endraw %}
