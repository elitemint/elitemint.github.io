{% raw %}This week we come together to celebrate and to learn more about what it is to be a part of God's plan as his children, the Church.<br />We welcome all to join us in celebrating the grace and love of Jesus and to together lift his name in praise and worship. We also celebrate Communion every week, so have some juice and bread handy so that you can join with us in remembering the price our God paid so that we can be in relationship with him. <br /><br />00:00 Welcome<br />00:23:55 Message- Alan Jones{% endraw %}
