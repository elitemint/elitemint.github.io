{% raw %}During this session, we'll take a look into the different options for maps in Power BI with a deep dive into the Icon Map visual for Power BI. We'll show how to add images, lines, and polygons to a map. How to add your own custom map layers, or even create maps like floor plans and others that aren't based on a world map at all.{% endraw %}
