Elliot Stabler, who returns to the NYPD after a decade away and must rebuild his life after a devastating personal loss. Meloni first played the role as an original cast member on &quot;&quot;Law &amp; Order: SVU.&quot;&quot;<br /><br />Stabler's sergeant and partner, Ayanna Bell (Danielle Moné Truitt), leads the task force with skillful authority, a vast knowledge of underground crime syndicates and a long-game strategy to take them down from the inside. Observant and deceivingly smart, Jet Slootmaekers (Ainsley Seiger) utilizes her tech expertise and hacking skills to give the team a leg up on striking their target.&quot;<br /><br />The Squad Races to Save Garcia's Wife | Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/DAe1JDxvWIQ">https://youtu.be/DAe1JDxvWIQ</a><br /><br />Law &amp; Order<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtube.com/c/lawandorder">http://youtube.com/c/lawandorder</a>{% endraw %}
