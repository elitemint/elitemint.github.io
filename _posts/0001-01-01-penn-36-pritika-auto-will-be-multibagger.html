We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or &quot;retains&quot; for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.<br /><br />A Side By Side comparison of Pritika Auto Industries' Earnings Growth And 11% ROE<br />At first glance, Pritika Auto Industries' ROE doesn't look very promising. Although a closer study shows that the company's ROE is higher than the industry average of 8.3% which we definitely can't overlook. But seeing Pritika Auto Industries' five year net income decline of 7.9% over the past five years, we might rethink that. Remember, the company's ROE is a bit low to begin with, just that it is higher than the industry average. So that could be one of the factors that are causing earnings growth to shrink.<br /><br />That being said, we compared Pritika Auto Industries' performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 21% in the same period<br /><br />Is Pritika Auto Industries Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?<br />While the company did payout a portion of its dividend in the past, it currently doesn't pay a dividend. This implies that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business.{% endraw %}
