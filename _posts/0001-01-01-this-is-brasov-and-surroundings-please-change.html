{% raw %}PLEASE CHANGE QUALITY TO HD (720p or 1080p). Now with Romanian &amp; Spanish subtitles.<br /><br />Subtitrat in limba romana si spaniola, apasa CC si selecteaza calitate HD (720p sau 1080p). <br /><br />Hello again dear friends, I'm Danny Paun and I'm pleased to present you my new film about an epic country...Romania! Here we are after a few months with another production that showcases a bit of Romania's nature and beauty. It took us a while in getting this ready just in time for a special day, 1st December, Romania's National Day. LA MULŢI ANI ROMÂNIA! <br /><br />This time around, we've been hiking the high Carpathian Mountains to get some breathtaking visuals and emphasis on the natural beauty of Romania. Apart from the lovely city of Brasov, we also visit some beautiful villages of Transylvania to film some really amazing fortified churches and fortresses that this part of the world has to offer, it just feels like we were back in time while over there, everything so pure and peaceful. It's been a few months in the making of this production and it was filmed in two seasons, from summer days of july and august to not so hot days of october and november... We'll definitely plan to make a winter video as it's quite unique over there.  <br /><br />Me and my small (but mighty) team hope that you will enjoy this one too. Please help us promote these amazing places and subscribe to our channel for more productions to come. Also, please visit our new website thisiswhyromania.com (you'll also find a short explanation why we decide to change the site and channel name). Thanks again for watching.<br /><br /><br />NOTE: please feel free to share but don't &quot;forget&quot; to credit/mention this page: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/thisiswhyromania">http://www.facebook.com/thisiswhyromania</a><br /><br />The soundtrack is by Tony Anderson - Eyes Wide Open (licensed via musicbed.com).<br />Filmed and edited over a period of four months using DJI Phantom 3 Professional (4K) and Sony and Canon DSLRs.<br />Subtitles in Spanish by Cecilia Alexandra<br /><br />© This is Why Romania - 2015{% endraw %}
