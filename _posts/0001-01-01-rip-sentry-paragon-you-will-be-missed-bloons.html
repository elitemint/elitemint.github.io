{% raw %}Bloons TD 6 New Update 28.0 - now that Sentry Paragon is Sentry Champion, it's finally time for me to give this tower a whirl. I want to use primarily the Sentry Paragon to defeat the entire Lych fight, how can this be possible?<br />Edited by: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/BenBenRanger">https://twitter.com/BenBenRanger</a><br /><br />Bloons Tower Defense 6 is the Super Mario Maker of strategy / tower defense games. Here, we showcase the most insane, creative levels created by players. Some are easy, some are &quot;0.01% pass rate&quot; hard, but all of them are lots of fun. If you've made a cool custom challenge, send it to me during Twitch streams and I'll play it!<br /><br />New to the channel?
