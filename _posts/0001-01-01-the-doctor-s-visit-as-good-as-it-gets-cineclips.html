Brooks' hit comedy, AS GOOD AS IT GETS. Nicholson gives a show-stopping performance as Melvin Udall, an obsessive-compulsive novelist with Manhattan's meanest mouth. But when his neighbor Simon is hospitalized, Melvin is forced to babysit Simon's dog. And that unexpected act of kindness, along with waitress Carol Connelly, helps put Melvin back in the human race.<br /><br />#AsGoodAsItGets #JackNicholson #HelenHunt #GregKinnear #CubaGoodingJr #JamesLBrooks #YeardleySmith<br /><br />Be sure to like and subscribe to discover more of your favourite movie clips and compilations!{% endraw %}
