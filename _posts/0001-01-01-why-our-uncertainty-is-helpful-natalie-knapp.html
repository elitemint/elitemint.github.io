{% raw %}Digitalisation, the pandemic, the climate crisis - all of these are rapidly changing our world. Change always means uncertainty, and most people dislike uncertainty and try to avoid it, because they find it difficult to cope with it. In her TEDxMünster talk, philosopher Natalie Knapp talks about how it is possible to use this lack of certainty to create something new. And she tells us why, from a neuro-scientific point of view, uncertainty as we all experience it during adolescence is really nature’s most valuable life hack. Dr. Natalie Knapp leads seminars, advises executives and gives lectures on coping with complexity, the crisis as an opportunity or how to come to terms with uncertainty.  As an author of popular nonfiction books, Knapp published &quot;The Infinite Moment: Why Times of Uncertainty Are So Valuable,&quot; &quot;Compass New Thinking: How We Can Orient Ourselves in a Confusing World,&quot; and &quot;The Quantum Leap of Thinking: What We Can Learn from Modern Physics.&quot; This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
