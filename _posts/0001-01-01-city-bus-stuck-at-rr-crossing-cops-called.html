{% raw %}Broken down train blocks a major 4 track railroad crossing and a metro bus gets trapped between the railroad crossing and cars backed up behind it.  Cincinnati Police Department was called.  The CSX train with a DPU was too long for the 2 locomotives.   An ambulance had to turn around.  Crossings were blocked for hours until a rescue locomotive tied onto the single leading locomotive.  The city bus couldn't move because cars were behind it.  Most cars were turning around but about 5 cars just sat behind the bus and a bus supervisor had to come out and ask the cars to turn around and then he helped the bus turn around.  I got most of it on camera except for the ambulance.  The stalled train only had one engine on the front and a mid train DPU and was way too long thanks to Precision Scheduled Railroading ( PSR ).  Part of the train was carrying interesting looking maintenance of way ( MOW ) equipment.  Notice the first train that passed it with 6 locomotives, 3 of which were Canadian Pacific Railway.  Another cool thing about this video is the Norfolk Southern train that passed the CSX train.  You can see the train knock down the signal ( change the signal from green to red ).  That is always cool son.   That train also had a DPU on the rear.   Filmed in Elmwood Place and Carthage in Cincinnati, Ohio on November 20, 2021.  Thanks for watching!
