{% raw %}Our team can manually analyze the target web application or web service for up to 8 hours using Fortify on Demand’s testing methodology to augment the WebInspect scan results with advanced, targeted penetration testing. Our experts conduct an in-depth examination of the application’s authentication scheme, session management, access control, and a review for logical flaws and faulty developer assumptions. They identify vulnerabilities that can only be detected through human intervention, including, but not limited to:<br />• The ability to harvest user accounts<br />• Bypassing multi-step authentication<br />• Password reset flaws<br />• Accessing other users’ data or sensitive content<br />• Horizontal or vertical privilege escalation<br />• Skip key transaction steps such as shopping cart payments<br />• Abuse of discount or business limit restrictions<br />• Unique business logic flaws due to faulty developer assumptions<br /><br />LEARN MORE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.microfocus.com/media/brochure/fortify_on_demand_dynamic_application_security_testing_brochure.pdf">https://www.microfocus.com/media/brochure/fortify_on_demand_dynamic_application_security_testing_brochure.pdf</a><br /><br />LEARN MORE about how Micro Focus was named a leader in the Gartner MQ for Application Security Testing: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://software.microfocus.com/en-us/assets/enterprise-security-products/magic-quadrant-for-application-security-testing">https://software.microfocus.com/en-us/assets/enterprise-security-products/magic-quadrant-for-application-security-testing</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE TO FORTIFY UNPLUGGED: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUDKcm1wIfE6EWk_SyK0D4w/featured?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUDKcm1wIfE6EWk_SyK0D4w/featured?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />CONNECT with the Fortify Online Community: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://community.microfocus.com/t5/Fortify/ct-p/fortify">https://community.microfocus.com/t5/Fortify/ct-p/fortify</a><br />- Connect with peers and share your knowledge<br />- Find solutions and answers to your technical questions<br />- Stay informed on new releases and product enhancements <br />- Access downloads, demos, videos and support tips{% endraw %}
