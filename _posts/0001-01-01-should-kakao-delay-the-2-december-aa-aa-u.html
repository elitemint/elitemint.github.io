{% raw %}I’m very happy that I can be making Archeage Content again and that the content in question doesn’t need to focus on all the bad things Trion or Gamigo is doing.  In fact, ever since Kakao began preparing to take over the publishing duties, I’ve been impressed with everything that’s been in the pipeline.  The communication for <br />everything is amazing, and with news coming well before it is needed.<br /><br />To transfer your data go here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://archeage.playkakaogames.com/transfer?lang=en">https://archeage.playkakaogames.com/transfer?lang=en</a><br /><br />For information on the land rush:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://archeage.playkakaogames.com/news/547">https://archeage.playkakaogames.com/news/547</a><br /><br />For information on the new skill tree:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://archeage.playkakaogames.com/news/542">https://archeage.playkakaogames.com/news/542</a><br /><br /><br />If you are a content creator and you need DMCA Free, No Copyright music for your shows, you can go here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://artists.spotify.com/c/artist/4qZWTa2bhoPr2AOsANBazT/profile/overview">https://artists.spotify.com/c/artist/4qZWTa2bhoPr2AOsANBazT/profile/overview</a>  Streamers can use this music during their livestreams without risk of DMCA or copyright infringement strikes.  <br /><br />Also remember that I am live on Twitch on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/paradox_gaming_network">https://www.twitch.tv/paradox_gaming_network</a>  If you have any Ashes of Creation questions, or really any questions, feel free to swing by and let’s talk.  <br /><br /><br />______________________________________________________<br />Visit Us on Other Platforms<br /><br />Ashes 101 Website for all your Ashes of Creation Educational Needs<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ashes101.com/">https://www.ashes101.com/</a><br /><br />Twitch - Where I stream on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/paradox_gaming_network">https://www.twitch.tv/paradox_gaming_network</a><br /><br />Spotify - DMCA/Copyright Free Music for Streamers<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://artists.spotify.com/c/artist/4qZWTa2bhoPr2AOsANBazT/profile/overview">https://artists.spotify.com/c/artist/4qZWTa2bhoPr2AOsANBazT/profile/overview</a><br /><br />Patreon <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/paradox_gaming_network">https://www.patreon.com/paradox_gaming_network</a><br /><br />All other socials<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/jahlon">https://linktr.ee/jahlon</a><br />______________________________________________________<br /><br />#archeage #archeageunchained #jahlon{% endraw %}
