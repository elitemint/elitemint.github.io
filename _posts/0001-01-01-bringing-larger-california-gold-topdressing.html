{% raw %}I am happy to report that the La Jolla shores installation is looking beautiful. Everything has held up during the rain for the most part. The only issue is runoff on the street level. The rain washed a way a significant amount of decomposed granite. To resolve this problem, Greg and I brought in 3/4 inch California gold topdressing rock. The heavier rock will stay in place and water should run right through it. Although there is no contrast in color, the size and texture difference are quite appealing to the eye. If you are struggling with runoff, try bringing in some different size rock. Have fun and happy gardening!{% endraw %}
