{% raw %}If you are interested in knowing whether purchase orders can be automated, you've come to the right place! Maarten Kruger from Tech Genius (an expert in creating business automation software), explains how purchase order processes can be automated.  He explains the complexity of the process of making a purchase order.  Purchase order processes often involve many parties, and you almost never have control over third parties. The more things you outsource, the more purchase orders you will need. Automating the purchase order process makes it possible for you to control the process from your end.  Automating purchase orders can even assist third parties in providing feedback faster without them even realising!  An automated purchase order system also reduces the need to manually enter all the necessary data and instead, allows users to review the automatically populated data for accuracy.
