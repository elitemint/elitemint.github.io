{% raw %}One of the many privileges of being born as a human being is that we can be self-conscious and self-aware. An elephant does not know that it is an elephant, but as humans, not only are we aware of our human existence, but we are also in touch with our feelings. We are aware of being loved. We have the faculty of being aware of our own bliss. It gives us the power to understand others' motives and reasons. Mahatria explains the importance of using this faculty of awareness in elevating our experiences in life.<br /><br />#Subscribe #infinitheism #Mahatria{% endraw %}
