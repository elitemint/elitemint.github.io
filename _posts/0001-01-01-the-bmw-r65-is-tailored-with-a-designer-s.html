{% raw %}Milanese craftsman Franco Augello and his shop Sumisura is now renowned for creating beautifully restored and customized BMW motorcycles, but the story really starts when Augello was just six years old. His grandfather gave Augello a very special Communion gift: a small motorcross bike. Ever since, Augello has been in love with motorcycles.<br /><br />A designer with a flair for the unusual and unique, Augello tailors vintage motorcycles to their next owner, often completing a full restoration along with tasteful modifications at a client’s request. The bikes in question often start with a similar theme: classic BMW touring designs; Augello says these bikes have a sterling reputation for reliability and longevity. <br /><br />Preserving these motorcycles’ unique qualities is made easier due to Augello’s preference to use original parts, often painstakingly restored to look and function like new. “Just like a tailored suit that has a sartorial quality,” Augello says of his creations, “it’s made for you, based on your physique.”<br /><br />Above all, however, Augello says his joy comes from being able to take something that was meant for the junkyard and giving it a second life. When you hear that classic BMW flat-twin fire up for the first time, there’s no doubt that Augello is creating magic on two wheels.<br /><br />Drive Tastefully®<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://Petrolicious.com">http://Petrolicious.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/Petrolicious">http://facebook.com/Petrolicious</a>{% endraw %}
