{% raw %}Last week, in a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, US President Donald Trump surprised the world by appearing to dismiss a long-standing US commitment to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.<br /><br />Prominent hard-right Israeli Education Minister, Naftali Bennett, welcomed the statement saying: &quot;The era of a Palestinian state is over.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;There already exists two states for the Palestinians: one in Gaza, a full blown state run by Hamas, and the other is Jordan, where 70 percent of the citizens are, indeed, Palestinians,&quot; Bennett told UpFront. &quot;So the discussion is whether we need a third Palestinian state smack in the heart of Israel, and the answer is no.&quot;<br /><br />When asked about the Israeli Supreme Court's 2005 ruling describing the West Bank as under &quot;belligerent occupation&quot;, Bennett called it a &quot;political decision&quot; and cited the Bible as proof of Israel's right to the West Bank.<br /><br />&quot;If you want to say that our land does not belong to us, I suggest you go change the Bible first,&quot; says Bennett.<br /><br />In this week's Headliner, we challenge the Israeli education minister and prominent right-wing leader Naftali Bennett.{% endraw %}
