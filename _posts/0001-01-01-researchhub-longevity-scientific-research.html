{% raw %}The future of scientific research is here. Meet ResearchHub, a platform for academics to upload, share and discuss research articles and results, organised into different specialised 'hubs' (including longevity!). ResearchHub is being built by a small team including Brian Armstrong (Coinbase CEO) and Patrick Joyce. I was fortunate to speak with them both about the issues in scientific research and how ResearchHub hopes to address them. In addition, Brian discusses his recent announcement regarding 'NewLimit' and both shares some great advice for preparing for the year ahead.<br /><br />Links:<br />Check out ResearchHub - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.researchhub.com/">https://www.researchhub.com/</a> <br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ResearchHub">https://twitter.com/ResearchHub</a> <br />Patrick - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/joycesticks">https://twitter.com/joycesticks</a> <br />Brian - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong">https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong</a> <br /><br />Find me on Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/EleanorSheekey">https://twitter.com/EleanorSheekey</a> <br /><br />I have Patreon - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/TheSheekeyScienceShow">https://www.patreon.com/TheSheekeyScienceShow</a><br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br />Intro - 00:00<br />ResearchHub - 00:30<br />Blockchain &amp; Funding academic research - 41:00<br />NewLimit &amp; Longevity - 44:00<br />Advice - 51:00{% endraw %}
