{% raw %}NEXT: Watch &quot;The #1 Way To GUARANTEE SUCCESS In Your Business&quot; <br />👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imSuYVwQ_i8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imSuYVwQ_i8</a><br /><br />One of the most important principles of business that you can learn is to keep it simple and boring. <br /><br />In other words, you need to learn business focus. It may sound odd, but this might just save you from yourself. What do I mean?<br /><br />Well, entrepreneurs are creative people. The problem is, you have to be able to channel that creativity. If you keep launching new programs rather than building on what you already have, you’ll never get anywhere.<br /><br />The key is to pay attention to the basics. Just focus on one thing until you reach a million dollars. Like I said, that may sound boring. But it’s one of the most important principles of business you can learn. By focusing on one product or program, you can keep refining it. With one program that you sell for $2,000 or $3,000, you’ll be able to scale much faster than if you had several lower-priced programs.<br /><br />Where many entrepreneurs lose their business focus is when they encounter people who don’t want to pay a premium price and so they then adjust their prices accordingly. Don’t try to cater to people who aren’t willing to pay. It only complicates your business.<br /><br />Stick to one thing and do it REALLY well. Then keep doing it. You may be tempted to chase new ideas, but if you can remain disciplined, you’ll thank yourself later. <br /><br />Maintain your business focus so that you can scale. When it comes to the principles of business, boring is powerful. Keep that in mind the next time you think about adding complications to what you already have.<br /><br /><br />*******************************************************************<br />Watch our FREE TRAINING: The Perfect Client Pipeline here:<br />➡️ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://healthpreneurgroup.com/yt-pcp">https://healthpreneurgroup.com/yt-pcp</a><br />*******************************************************************<br /><br />Grab my newest book, “MindFloss”, on Amazon → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://mindflossbook.com">http://mindflossbook.com</a> <br /><br />Join us inside the Healthpreneur Hub 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://healthpreneurgroup.com/hub​​">https://healthpreneurgroup.com/hub​​</a><br /><br /><br />★☆★  SUBSCRIBE TO THE CHANNEL  ★☆★<br /><br />Subscribe → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://healthpreneurgroup.com/youtube-subscribe">https://healthpreneurgroup.com/youtube-subscribe</a> <br /><br /><br />★☆★ FOLLOW US ONLINE ★☆★<br /><br />Website ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://healthpreneurgroup.com">https://healthpreneurgroup.com</a><br />Instagram ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/healthpreneur">https://instagram.com/healthpreneur</a> <br />TikTok ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yurielkaim">https://www.tiktok.com/@yurielkaim</a> <br />Facebook ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/healthpreneur1">https://facebook.com/healthpreneur1</a> <br />iTunes (Podcast) ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://healthpreneurgroup.com/itunes">https://healthpreneurgroup.com/itunes</a> <br /><br /><br />★☆★ ABOUT HEALTHPRENEUR® ★☆★<br /><br />Healthpreneur® is a world-renowned coaching and training company for health practice owners who want to serve more patients and scale their practices (virtually or in-person) without burning out in the process.<br /><br />It was founded by New York Times bestselling author and health practice success mentor, Yuri Elkaim, who has built two multiple 7-figure health businesses that have served over 500,000 people since 2006.<br /><br />We are on a mission to transform the lives of 1 BILLION people on the planet and we will accomplish this ambitious goal by helping thousands of practitioners build better run, more profitable, “talk of the town” practices that transform their communities.<br /><br /><br />★☆★ WORK WITH US ★☆★<br /><br />Whether you want to predictably attract more patients, grow your health practice without <br />everything relying on you, or take your expertise online, we can likely help. <br />As long as you own your own practice, are great at what you do, and you’re willing to take ownership of the marketing and business skills required to grow your practice, we can help you accomplish big things.<br /><br />Learn more here → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://healthpreneurgroup.com/work-with-us/">https://healthpreneurgroup.com/work-with-us/</a><br /><br /><br />Boring Is POWERFUL In Business!
