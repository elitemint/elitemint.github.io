{% raw %}The much-anticipated return of Muslim stand-up Cassim (Riaad Moosa) has him learning that all roads lead to home. Joey Rasdien, Vincent Ebrahim, Schalk Bezuidenhout.<br /><br />Coming to Nu Metro Friday 1st October, 2021: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://numet.ro/material2">https://numet.ro/material2</a><br /><br />Cassim Caif is a young Muslim man living in Fordsburg, Johannesburg. Heʼs balancing the demands of a new marriage, a young child, and living in a house with his ageing parents with being one of South Africaʼs few Muslim stand-up comedians. His father, Ebrahim, has reluctantly accepted his sonʼs chosen career—for now—but is still simmering over the issue.<br /><br /><br /><br />While Cassimʼs career is going reasonably well, he performs mostly to Johannesburg Muslim audiences. Heʼs frustrated; he wants more, to expand his audience and range and get better at what he does. His best friend, Yusuf, has inadvertently become his agent. Yusuf is extremely well-meaning, but is slipping increasingly further out of his depth. Heʼs planned a national tour for Cassim to expand horizons.<br /><br /><br /><br />One of their many problems getting sponsorship from the notorious Laudium businessman, Shabir Sulabie, to get the tour on the road. Shabir is heir to the Sulabie Chicken Bite empire and fancies himself as a showman. Yusuf believes itʼs worth the risk, so the ill-fated tour begins.<br /><br />The much-anticipated return of Cassim trying to figure out family, love, and comedy.<br /><br />Cast: Riaad Moosa, Joey Rasdien, Vincent Ebrahim, Schalk Bezuidenhout, Carishman Basday, Denise Newman<br />Music: President Kapa<br />Producer: Robbie Thorpe, Ronnie Apteker<br />Screenplay: Craig Freimond, Riaad Moosa<br />Director: Craig Freimond<br /><br />Genre: Comedy, Drama<br />Running time: 101<br />Age restriction: 10–12PG D L P V<br /><br />#NewMaterial<br /><br />#material2 #RiaadMoosa #JoeyRasdien #VincentEbrahim #SchalkBezuidenhout #CarishmanBasday #DeniseNewman #PresidentKapa #RobbieThorpe #RonnieApteker #CraigFreimond #SouthAfricanfilm #SouthAfrica #NewMaterialMovie #MaterialMovie2 #Comedy #Drama #IndigenousFilmDistribution #Movie #Trailer #MovieTrailer #OfficialTrailer #Official #Trailers #MovieTrailers{% endraw %}
