Over the 2010s, he averaged a 33% return, every year, blowing almost every other investor out of the water. Social Capital, his firm bet big on some pretty risky moves, including investing millions into Tesla years ago when it was on the brink of bankruptcy, and then bringing other hyper growth companies public via a bunch of different SPACs. We don‚Äôt need to wonder then, why people like to listen to him, why we all quiet down when he speaks, because we know that there‚Äôs going to be something valuable said. Imagine my surprise then, when the SPAC king himself, the man who bet big on hyper-growth tech stocks like Tesla, announced that he is expecting that entire market to collapse in the coming years. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going to look at today, what Chamath said, why he said it, and what it means for us. <br /><br />DISCLAIMERS:<br />Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
