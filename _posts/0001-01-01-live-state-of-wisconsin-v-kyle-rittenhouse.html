{% raw %}Wisconsin v. Kyle Rittenhouse | Day 5<br /><br />Much of the day Thursday was spent with witness Richie McGinniss. McGinniss is the Chief Video Director of the Daily Caller (outlet founded by Neil Patel and Tucker Carlson of FOX News) He states he's been with them since 2017 and that he considers himself to be someone who works alongside journalists every day. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the one who helps them get the video onto whatever platform necessary.‚Äù <br /><br />McGinniss was filming prior to the first shooting, involving Rosenbaum, he was also one of the people rendering aid after Rosenbaum was shot, and along with others, took Rosenbaum to the hospital. <br /><br />McGinniss said he believed he was recording video of Rosenbaum chasing Rittenhouse, but in the chaos he pressed the photo button instead. He said he is not sure how, but his phone began recording video as McGinniss was standing over Rosenbaum‚Äôs body, trying to help him after he was shot. <br /><br />McGinniss referencing Rittenhouse ‚Äúpeople were casting negative looks in his direction and he didn't seem to be aware of that,‚Äù <br /><br />McGinniss was also questioned about whether others, aside from Rosenbaum, were chasing Rittenhouse immediately before the shooting. He said he was mostly focused on Rittenhouse‚Äôs AR-15 style gun, but he believed others were not involved in the chase. <br /><br />McGinniss stated he believed he was in danger as Rittenhouse turned the gun toward Rosenbaum. Then, asked if he ever saw Rosenbaum touch Rittenhouse's gun, stated &quot;If he did, it didn't alter the trajectory of the weapon.&quot; <br /><br />Last testimony given Thursday came from Ryan Balch. Balch, who went to Kenosha the night of the shooting with two guns and body armor to protect businesses, testified that he kept Rittenhouse close because he seemed inexperienced and young. Rittenhouse, 17 at the time, told Balch he was 19 years old and that he was certified as an EMT ‚Äî he was not. <br /><br />Balch said he did not see Rosenbaum actually strike or injure anyone, but testified that Rosenbaum shouted: ‚ÄúIf I catch any of you guys alone tonight I‚Äôm going to f****** kill you.‚Äù Rittenhouse was present for the interaction, Balch said. <br /><br />Rittenhouse and Balch got separated shortly before the shooting. <br /><br />Rittenhouse is charged with five felonies: first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide, attempted first-degree intentional homicide and two counts of first-degree recklessly endangering safety. He is also charged with misdemeanor possession of a dangerous weapon under the age of 18 and a non-criminal violation of failure to comply with an emergency order. He has pleaded not guilty.<br /><br />JOIN OUR DISCORD<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/nzqAtgrkby">https://discord.gg/nzqAtgrkby</a> <br /><br />BECOME A MEMBER<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA_KjizAMeuEKL9d7dkvPeg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA_KjizAMeuEKL9d7dkvPeg/join</a> <br /><br />WATCH ON FACEBOOK<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AndrewMercadoMedia">https://www.facebook.com/AndrewMercadoMedia</a> <br /><br />MERCH <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://theletteringmachine.com/mercado_media/shop/home">https://theletteringmachine.com/mercado_media/shop/home</a> <br /><br />#KyleRittenhouse<br />#RittenhouseTrial{% endraw %}
