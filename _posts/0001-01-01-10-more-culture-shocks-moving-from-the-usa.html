This time, we look at whether or not to put ice in drinks, the Aga, and going to the pub. Who'd like to see us try a pub quiz on this channel? Be sure to comment down below if you want us to make that happen...<br /><br />Huge thanks again to Stephen (heâ€™s a 'scouser' from Liverpool!) and Claire (from Somerset) for joining me and sharing their insights into these trans-Atlantic differences.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this video, be sure to LIKE &amp; SUBSCRIBE!<br /><br />You can also follow me on social media here:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/juliemontagu">https://www.instagram.com/juliemontagu</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/juliemontagu">https://www.facebook.com/juliemontagu</a>{% endraw %}
