{% raw %}Stephen Sharer is living underwater for 24 hours with his best friends Topper Guild and girlfriend Colie! Last vlog, Colie won a Mcalren supercar so she pulls up to Stephens house in it and then heads to the backyard pool to jump in and live for 24 hours underwater in the backyard pool just like Ben Azelart from Amp Squad did.
