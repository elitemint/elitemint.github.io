{% raw %}Organization needs to be matched with functionality. That is the key to making the most of a small home workshop.<br /><br />This was the inspiration behind my simplified screw feeder. <br />An organization and storage unit that offers immediate and easy access to the screws stored inside.<br /><br />I designed the unit for my most used screw sizes. The ones I use on almost every project I make. Now I can just reach over and grab a handful. <br /><br />A BIG thank you to UPAT for sponsoring this video! - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.upat.co.za">http://www.upat.co.za</a><br /><br />Find out more about the Fischer Duo wall plugs:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.upat.co.za/products/anchoring-systems/general-fixings/item/577-fischer-duopower-nylon-plug">https://www.upat.co.za/products/anchoring-systems/general-fixings/item/577-fischer-duopower-nylon-plug</a><br /><br />Find out more about Stabila products:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.upat.co.za/our-brands/stabila">https://www.upat.co.za/our-brands/stabila</a><br /><br />To support my channel visit one of our merch stores:<br /><br />USA - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/woodshop-junkies-usa">https://teespring.com/stores/woodshop-junkies-usa</a><br />EU - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/woodshop-junkies-eu">https://teespring.com/stores/woodshop-junkies-eu</a><br /><br />Or follow my projects on social media:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/woodworkjunkiesite/">https://www.facebook.com/woodworkjunkiesite/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/woodworkjunkie/">https://www.instagram.com/woodworkjunkie/</a><br /><br />Check Out My Gear (Affiliate):<br /><br />USA - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/woodshopjunkies">https://www.amazon.com/shop/woodshopjunkies</a><br /><br />UK - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/shop/woodshopjunkies">https://www.amazon.co.uk/shop/woodshopjunkies</a><br /><br />Other videos you might enjoy:<br /><br />DIY French Cleat Wall:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/lA3--s1aQp4">https://youtu.be/lA3--s1aQp4</a><br /><br />Gravity Clamp:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/2mlq9ZPnvig">https://youtu.be/2mlq9ZPnvig</a><br /><br />Fold Away Miter Saw:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/3wQZ74Agc0k">https://youtu.be/3wQZ74Agc0k</a><br /><br /><br />Some product links may be affiliate links which means that I may earn a commission if you click on the link and/or make a purchase.
