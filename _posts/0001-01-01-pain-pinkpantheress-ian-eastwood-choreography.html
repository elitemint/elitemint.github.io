DANCE VIDEOS. while i do enjoy every detail of producing and directing REAL MUSIC VIDEOS which was one of my biggest goals as a director, now i realize how there will never be anything to replace the freedom and excitement i feel through trying my hardest and putting my name on the line as the focal point in my own work as an artist.<br />•<br />i know times are really different now and a lot of dancers are looking for direction on what may be next for us and i don’t have any of the answers…but i do hope…that this video will inspire at least ONE CREATOR to go out there and try their absolute hardest with a group of friends to make something special they believe in. this way we can keep adding to our dance narrative and pass down the story telling style we can bring to life through DANCE!<br />•<br />big shout out to my DP GERALD for always holding me down and bringing my insane visions to life through relentless details. big shout out to ROMEO and BRANDON for spending every day of the last 6 days with me over 12 hrs a day to fine tune every nook and cranny of this video, i quite literally could NEVER have done this without you guys. big shout out to my lady, leslie, because i can’t wait till she gets home and i made this video thinking about her and missing her while she is working in europe! and the BIGGEST SHOUT OUT to STEEZY STUDIO for producing this video, supporting me, and more than anything TRUSTING ME!<br />•<br />MORE VIDEOS TO COME, AND MORE BIG PROJECTS WITH STEEZY AND YOUNG LIONS PRODUCTIONS ON THE HORIZON. THANK YOU GUYS FOR WATCHING, I WOULDN’T HAVE THE LIFE I HAVE WITHOUT YOU GUYS!<br />•<br />LOVE,<br />IAN<br />•<br />P.S. - if you read this far…i’m gunna let you in on an early secret… i will be making a 1/1 NFT from this video that will go up for auction. i’ve never sold a piece of my videos EVER. can you guess which section it might be? can’t wait to see everyone’s guesses in the comments!{% endraw %}
