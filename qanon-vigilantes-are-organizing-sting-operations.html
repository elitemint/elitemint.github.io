Like people these like pedophile trackers and hunters. Because there was one kind of that it's made a little bit of news around here where this guy tried to create his pedophile hunting tracking group and weirdly enough he gets he got arrested a couple of months ago because he guesses he was you know threatening people. And like he was being abusive to women and weirdly enough they were all you know 18 19 years old as well. And that kind of you knows close to that under underage range. But I didn't know if that was a trend you've been seeing kind of nationwide or at least larger than just my like one little incident here.<br />Matt: Right I mean it's even wider than that I think. I think like I mean you last summer especially when they were using like the save the children branding to try to spread that that's part of q anon to the masses. And it worked. You had in life real-world rallies mostly of like you know middle-aged women holding up save the children signs to bring awareness to child trafficking and what's going on in that world. When they were just pushing q in on conspiracy theories. I mean it's certainly something. it's there's something there. and you even have shady organizations there's one I can't remember the name they were involved with that that that q anon believing former WWE referee was big in pushing them. they were an organization that used q anon to get more eyeballs on like what they say is like they're saving the children. they're tracking child traffickers. when they have very a lot of sketchy dealings and promoting winds where they weren't any wins there for them. yeah, there's a lot of of that for sure. and I can't speak to anyone specifically but there's a lot of projection too in that world in terms of the people searching to fight for the child traffickers or fighting the child traffickers ending up being pedophiles themselves.<br />Caller: yeah that’s I mean it was no shock there. and yeah he was that was used a lot because he was getting spread around all locally you know I’m just on Facebook and stuff using that save the children thing. and then like I said yeah when he got arrested for basically and he wasn't even like doing child trafficking he was trying to kind of like entrap people more or less by like pretending he was like a 14-year-old and then he would just basically go and publicly shame him and try to citizens arrest people. and even the police were like you got it to the police's credit for this one they were like you can't do this like this is all illegal and that sort of stuff there. <br />Matt: right to catch you messed with a whole generation of people.<br />Brandon: I think yeah that's my point too. I was gonna say you know I think you know it can't be understated that we've had a lot of moral panics surrounding this nebulous threat of like child abduction. you know and they've you know and they've always been used to like condemn a problematic you know as per moral panics condemn a problematic you know population or some population. of our culture, you know we know how we had like the gender panics and like the gay, you know male pink of the 70s. that you know with the satanic panic and the babysitter stuff that was going around. but this sort of the root of like you know this outside un-American you know non-white forces usually are going to come and abduct your children is a through-line throughout our culture. like you know to be used as a way to rile up you know that suburban base that we idolize so much in our politics.
